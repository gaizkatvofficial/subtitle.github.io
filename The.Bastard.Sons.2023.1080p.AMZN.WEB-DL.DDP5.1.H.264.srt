1
00:00:56,758 --> 00:00:59,794
<i>Vincent, hey. It's me.</i>

2
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,897
<i>Wish you would pick up</i>
<i>the phone more often.</i>

3
00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:07,067
<i>It's been four weeks, baby.</i>
<i>Okay, we all loved him.</i>

4
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:10,470
<i>Just-- just let me know</i>
<i>you're okay.</i>

5
00:01:10,572 --> 00:01:14,341
<i>Come home.</i>
<i>Please, we need you.</i>

6
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:18,278
<i>I love you. I love you.</i>

7
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:41,268
<i>I'm not a good man.</i>

8
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:44,237
<i>Everything I learned in life</i>

9
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:49,077
<i>was from my father,</i>
<i>Enzo Damiano.</i>

10
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:52,145
<i>He was a self-made man.</i>

11
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,649
<i>He was ruthless.</i>

12
00:01:54,749 --> 00:01:57,652
<i>Heartless. Brutal.</i>

13
00:01:57,752 --> 00:01:58,820
<i>He needed to be.</i>

14
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:07,494
<i>I didn't play soccer and shit</i>
<i>growing up.</i>

15
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:11,498
<i>Never had swimming lessons</i>
<i>and never went camping.</i>

16
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,736
<i>I was taught how to spot</i>
<i>the guy who was bluffing.</i>

17
00:02:14,836 --> 00:02:19,073
<i>How to hit someone so it hurt,</i>
<i>handle cash, hustle.</i>

18
00:02:21,576 --> 00:02:25,680
<i>He trained me like a soldier.</i>
<i>To be like him.</i>

19
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:30,518
<i>My father began this business</i>
<i>30 years ago</i>

20
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:33,521
<i>with his partner, Frank Rome.</i>

21
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:36,490
<i>He brought me in when I was 18.</i>

22
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:40,427
<i>I had to earn my own respect,</i>
<i>same way everyone else did.</i>

23
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:45,033
<i>So I got my own crew together,</i>
<i>my brothers.</i>

24
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:47,167
<i>We really didn't have a choice.</i>

25
00:02:49,871 --> 00:02:53,841
<i>Enzo said he always wanted me</i>
<i>to take over the business.</i>

26
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:57,210
<i>I knew Rome would have</i>
<i>an issue with that.</i>

27
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,680
<i>And when the old man told me</i>

28
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,449
<i>he was getting ready</i>
<i>to step down and bump me up,</i>

29
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,619
<i>he ended up dead</i>
<i>two weeks later.</i>

30
00:03:09,157 --> 00:03:10,925
<i>Eye for an eye,</i>
<i>tooth for a tooth.</i>

31
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:15,195
<i>First lesson</i>
<i>my father ever taught me.</i>

32
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:24,505
<i>Second lesson:</i>
<i>Take what's yours.</i>

33
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:09,016
Five minutes.

34
00:04:09,117 --> 00:04:11,451
-More like 20 minutes, man.

35
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,788
Hey, how are you?

36
00:04:13,888 --> 00:04:15,556
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.

37
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,357
Good to see you.

38
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:21,529
You good?
-Yeah, I'm good.

39
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,998
Okay, I'll get the bag.
Come on.

40
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:25,166
How's the guys?

41
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,501
They're ready.

42
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:36,677
How you guys
doing for money?

43
00:04:36,778 --> 00:04:38,112
- We're good.
- You sure?

44
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:40,014
-Yeah, we're good.
-Liv is doing all right?

45
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:43,885
Yeah, yeah.
We kept an eye on her for you.

46
00:04:43,985 --> 00:04:45,285
-I appreciate it.

47
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,522
She's a toughie.

48
00:04:47,622 --> 00:04:52,425
- Yeah. My fireball.
- Yeah.

49
00:04:52,527 --> 00:04:53,761
-Must have heard from Rome,
right?

50
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:57,865
Oh, yeah.
We jammed him up big.

51
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,600
You know, with your father
not around,

52
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,036
still trying to put together
the pieces.

53
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:08,843
-Yo.
-Yeah, there he is.

54
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,211
<i>So, when you back?</i>

55
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:11,946
<i>Yeah, later on. I got</i>
<i>to handle something real quick,</i>

56
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:13,614
and then I'm gonna shoot up.
You coming over later?

57
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:16,349
-I hear all the boys
are getting back together.

58
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,920
Just tying up some ends
in Asbury with Ray-Boy

59
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,288
and then I'm shooting up.

60
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:21,522
-All right,
I'll see you later on.

61
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:24,058
-All right. See you later.

62
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,392
Let's hit the diner.

63
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:30,031
-You sure
your cousin's good to go?

64
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:31,899
-Yeah, he's ready when we are.

65
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,630
There's a piece
in the glove box.

66
00:06:04,232 --> 00:06:06,466
-Nah, I'm all right.

67
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,002
-Vincent, take the piece.

68
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:10,671
-He's not stupid, yo.

69
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:12,907
- I'd feel
a hell of a lot better

70
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:13,741
if you just took it.

71
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,509
-Dobs, he does something stupid,

72
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,477
he's getting off tonight, right?

73
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:21,182
-Sooner than that.
-Okay. He needs me.

74
00:06:21,282 --> 00:06:23,551
He needs money.
We jammed him up good.

75
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:28,421
-All right.

76
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:29,657
Big's inside.

77
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:31,893
Just in case.

78
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,496
You got this.

79
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:39,432
-Stay focused.

80
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:43,738
-All right.

81
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:56,851
-Good?

82
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,990
- Yup.
- Hey. Eyes on you.

83
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,792
Car to my right.

84
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:17,772
All right.

85
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:22,543
-Stay cool, Vin.

86
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:29,150
Pick a card now.
Pick a card now.

87
00:07:30,985 --> 00:07:32,720
You have ten points left. Turn.

88
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,523
You're going down.
Let's see what you have.

89
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:40,127
Let me see if you know
what you're doing.

90
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:41,295
I'll tell you right now.

91
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,218
-Good to fuckin' see ya, Vin.
-You too.

92
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:39,487
-Sorry to hear 'bout your dad.
-Oh. Thanks. Thanks.

93
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:41,255
Yeah. Did Dobs call you?
-Yeah, couple hours ago.

94
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,290
I shot right over.

95
00:08:43,391 --> 00:08:45,493
-All right. Uh--

96
00:08:45,593 --> 00:08:46,761
'Preciate it.
You'll be here for a while?

97
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:48,362
-Yeah, I'll be here, man.
Do your thing.

98
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:49,730
Let me know.
Want me to come up?

99
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,565
-Nah, I'm good. Thanks.
-Just say the word, Vin.

100
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:52,733
- All right.
- Hurry up.

101
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,902
Fifty on Frankie--
oh, shit!

102
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:56,871
Oh, shit! Vin!
What's up, bro?

103
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:59,907
Good to see you, man.
Huh? Yo!

104
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:01,542
Wait-- what the--
what day is it?

105
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:04,345
-It's Tue-- it's Wednesday.
-Fuck, man. All right.

106
00:09:04,445 --> 00:09:05,546
I-- I put the GPS on
the other night,

107
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:06,680
you're good to go.

108
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:07,848
-Yeah. Uh, go square up
with Dobs,

109
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:09,984
he's in the car.
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

110
00:09:13,522 --> 00:09:14,822
-Sorry to hear
about your father, Vin.

111
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:16,957
-Thanks, Joe. I appreciate it.
What's up, buddy?

112
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:18,559
Yeah, man.
You need anything, let us know.

113
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:19,860
All right.
You got it. You got it.

114
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,895
Where's, uh, Rome? Upstairs?

115
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:22,196
He's waiting for you.

116
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:23,264
All right. Cool.

117
00:09:23,364 --> 00:09:24,498
Boy, what's up, man?

118
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:33,040
-Come in.

119
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:40,481
-Vincent.

120
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,049
- Hey. Hey.

121
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,451
-Hey. Hey.

122
00:09:43,552 --> 00:09:45,453
There he is.
What's going on?

123
00:09:45,554 --> 00:09:46,687
Good to see you, buddy.
- Thank you.

124
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:48,355
-Good. How you doin'?
Good to see you.

125
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,792
Oh, it's good to see you.

126
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:53,761
- You, too.
- Hey.

127
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:54,962
What's going on?
You good?

128
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:56,363
-Yeah, yeah. Thanks, man.
-You good?

129
00:09:56,464 --> 00:09:57,798
-Guys, take off.

130
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:00,535
Obviously, we have a little
catching up to do.

131
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,369
Say hello.
-Man, it's uh, nice to see you.

132
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,004
- Then say goodbye.
- You, too.

133
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:06,907
Dennis.

134
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:09,777
This what you do?
- Hey, what up?

135
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:11,212
-You disappear
and then you just pop up?

136
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,681
How you been, brother?
- How are you?

137
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:15,049
-I'm all right.
You tell me how you been.

138
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:16,884
It's been a long time.
- Yeah.

139
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:18,185
-Yeah. I'm sorry
to hear about your dad.

140
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,221
-Thanks, man.
-You got some talking to do.

141
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:21,622
Yeah?
-Yes, we do. Yeah.

142
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:22,923
-Well, you want to
get through that.

143
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,258
-We'll talk. All right?
I'll give you a call

144
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:25,726
tomorrow or somethin'.
-You sure about that?

145
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:27,228
Slow it down. Okay?
-Okay. Okay. I will.

146
00:10:27,328 --> 00:10:28,563
Say hi to the kids, huh?

147
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:29,797
-Close the door.

148
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:31,398
Thank you.

149
00:10:31,499 --> 00:10:32,766
-How you doing, bro?

150
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:34,802
-Great.

151
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:37,572
-Where's your crew been?

152
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:38,739
-Why don't you
ask your mother?

153
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:40,841
-Flip, Flip,

154
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:41,876
Flip.

155
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,212
Would you give us a few, please?

156
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:58,359
You want a drink?
Let me get you a drink.

157
00:10:58,459 --> 00:10:59,727
-Yeah, I'll take a drink.

158
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:06,568
We were worried
about you, Vincent.

159
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,035
Here.

160
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:11,606
Salute, to your,
uh, to your dad.

161
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:13,140
-Salute.

162
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:18,245
Please, sit down.
Sit down. Relax.

163
00:11:20,915 --> 00:11:23,417
-So, uh... so how are you?

164
00:11:23,518 --> 00:11:26,987
-I know you're probably worried
a little bit, but I'm fine.

165
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:29,123
I owe you an apology, Rome.

166
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,725
I just couldn't be here.

167
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:34,828
-Well, you lost your dad.

168
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,999
And I lost a brother.

169
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:43,170
And I dealt with it my way,
behind closed doors.

170
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:47,341
And, um... yes,
it is going to be hard

171
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:50,477
for us to move forward,
but we've got to do it.

172
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:52,980
-Yeah, I know.

173
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,683
I just appreciate
you giving me that time.

174
00:11:54,782 --> 00:11:55,916
Thank you.

175
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:01,155
-I didn't have a choice, did I?

176
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,193
We took a big hit, Vincent.

177
00:12:06,628 --> 00:12:08,429
-Yeah, I just found out
about that.

178
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:10,231
-You're telling me
you didn't know

179
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:12,466
that your own brothers
were telling everybody

180
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:14,101
that they would
cut off their dicks

181
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:15,670
if they worked
while you were gone?

182
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:17,137
You didn't know that?

183
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:18,607
-No.

184
00:12:18,707 --> 00:12:19,708
-No?

185
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:21,375
-They got their own minds, Rome.

186
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,744
-We've been completely
shut down for a month, okay?

187
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,614
We've dug
a really deep hole here.

188
00:12:25,714 --> 00:12:28,148
-I'm gonna handle it.
-That's a lot of
cleaning up, Vincent.

189
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:30,017
-I'll handle it.

190
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:31,051
All right?

191
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:35,389
-Okay, okay,
it is what it is now.

192
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,891
You-- you're ready to
come back to work?

193
00:12:37,992 --> 00:12:40,427
-That's why I'm here.

194
00:12:40,595 --> 00:12:41,730
-And you're ready
to give the okay

195
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:43,665
for all our operations now?

196
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:44,965
-You don't need my okay, Rome.

197
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:46,668
-Well, apparently we do.

198
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:47,901
I mean, these guys
are family men.

199
00:12:48,002 --> 00:12:50,037
They don't want
their dicks cut off.

200
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:52,574
-Yeah, it's all clear. Yeah.

201
00:12:52,674 --> 00:12:56,243
-Okay. Okay.

202
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:57,978
Business first?

203
00:12:58,078 --> 00:12:59,380
-Yeah.

204
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,081
- All right.

205
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:03,752
Your-- your brothers,
they around?

206
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:05,185
They're around. Yeah.

207
00:13:05,286 --> 00:13:07,221
-Good. And is--
is tomorrow too soon?

208
00:13:07,555 --> 00:13:10,725
No, it's
good. -Good. Because, uh--

209
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:13,360
we got a big delivery
from Butchie.

210
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,495
You want to do security?

211
00:13:14,596 --> 00:13:15,963
-Yeah.

212
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:17,431
-He was asking for you,

213
00:13:17,532 --> 00:13:18,667
told to send you regards.

214
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:21,001
So you-- you want to
do this yourself?

215
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:22,637
-Yeah, I'll bring Dobs with me.

216
00:13:22,737 --> 00:13:24,004
- Good. Good.

217
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:25,306
All right, Flip will
give you all the details.

218
00:13:25,406 --> 00:13:27,408
We'll have the cash
ready when you leave.

219
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:29,443
Right now, okay?
-Yeah.

220
00:13:29,544 --> 00:13:33,280
-And, uh-- our friends
in North Jersey, you know,

221
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,686
our movers, they're like
two months behind.

222
00:13:37,786 --> 00:13:39,019
I couldn't even send anyone.

223
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,988
So my idea is I'll send
the guys to do that.

224
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:42,022
Is that all right with you?

225
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:43,357
-Yeah, they can do it tomorrow.

226
00:13:43,457 --> 00:13:45,426
-Tomorrow?
Don't you want to be there?

227
00:13:46,561 --> 00:13:47,595
-They're good.

228
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:53,200
-Okay.

229
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:58,038
Okay, give me a minute.

230
00:14:03,545 --> 00:14:07,716
Hey, Flip. Um, listen,
bring the, uh, the cookies

231
00:14:07,816 --> 00:14:10,050
for Vincent
to give to Butchie, all right?

232
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,020
And everybody else, listen up.
We're back to work.

233
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,689
Everything's on schedule, okay?

234
00:14:14,789 --> 00:14:15,956
Back to work.

235
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:18,192
-And Barca, call everyone
who isn't here.

236
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:21,261
You know what to tell them.
All right.

237
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:25,199
Okay, we got that done.

238
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:35,876
Yeah, so...
on to other business.

239
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:39,913
I think I know who did this.

240
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:42,784
-I'm listening.

241
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,451
-I don't know if
I should tell you, Vincent.

242
00:14:44,552 --> 00:14:46,186
I mean, not right now.

243
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,790
It's way too soon
for us to make a move.

244
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:52,426
-Rome, tell me.
-Vincent, listen to me.

245
00:14:52,527 --> 00:14:54,863
If we make a move,
we will start a war.

246
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:58,132
We haven't made a dime
in over a month.

247
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:00,067
We have a lot of
catching up to do.

248
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:02,604
Now, if it was your father--
and God rest his soul,

249
00:15:02,704 --> 00:15:03,971
I respect him--

250
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:06,273
he would have rolled already,
all right?

251
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:07,675
You know, if anything
happened to you or me,

252
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:09,109
he would have rolled,

253
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,211
because he's got
the mind of a warrior.

254
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:15,315
And I say this with complete
respect and love for him.

255
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:20,921
But you? You're smarter
in a lot of ways.

256
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:23,558
So I'm asking you,
and I'm telling you

257
00:15:23,658 --> 00:15:28,162
that I need you to just
keep your emotions tight,

258
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:29,430
just for a little bit,
all right?

259
00:15:29,531 --> 00:15:30,931
It's good for business.

260
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,700
We rebuild,

261
00:15:32,801 --> 00:15:36,336
and then we take out every one
of those motherfuckers.

262
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:39,006
Trust me.

263
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:42,877
Vince, I need to know
you're with me on this, okay?

264
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:45,647
I need to know
you can keep your head.

265
00:15:45,747 --> 00:15:47,615
Can you do that?

266
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:54,321
I feel if I tell you,
you'll lose control.

267
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:57,224
I mean, I'm having trouble
keeping fucking control, okay?

268
00:15:57,324 --> 00:16:00,260
-Do I know him?
-No, no, but I do.

269
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,330
And he and your father
went way, way, way back.

270
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,900
I know this motherfucker,
and I know that this strategy

271
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:08,101
is the right one
to deal with him.

272
00:16:08,202 --> 00:16:11,138
And we'll get these pricks
when the time is right.

273
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:14,308
-Next week.
-Vincent--

274
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:15,743
Give me
a fucking break.

275
00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:16,778
You know, Rome,
I think I'm being

276
00:16:16,878 --> 00:16:18,947
pretty fucking cool right now.

277
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:20,882
And I'm keeping cool for you
and everybody else.

278
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:22,650
You gotta tell me next week.

279
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:29,056
-Okay. I'll tell you next week,

280
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:32,192
but Vincent, if we
want to come out on top,

281
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,863
we gotta play chess here.
You understand?

282
00:16:34,963 --> 00:16:36,296
-Of course I understand.
I'm a Damiano.

283
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,398
I know the fucking game, Rome.

284
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:42,102
-I know you do.

285
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:45,707
All right, good.

286
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:48,676
Let me know how everything
goes tomorrow, okay?

287
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:52,814
-I will.

288
00:16:52,914 --> 00:16:54,114
Thanks for the drink.

289
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,017
-Vincent?

290
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:01,054
I'm glad you're back.

291
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:05,259
I'm glad you're okay.

292
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:08,028
- All right.
- All right.

293
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:08,963
-I'll let you know
when it's handled, all right?

294
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:10,999
Okay.

295
00:17:13,935 --> 00:17:16,538
Oof!

296
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,281
Yo.

297
00:17:28,783 --> 00:17:29,984
-You square up
with Darius yet?

298
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,786
-I'll see 'im
when I see 'im.

299
00:17:31,886 --> 00:17:33,487
-Not the guy
to owe money to.

300
00:17:33,588 --> 00:17:35,289
He's a big boy,
he'll be all right.

301
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:38,960
-It's your ass, motherfucker.
Switch. Who's in that car?

302
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,361
Uh, new guy. Gummy.

303
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:44,566
-Gummy?
-Yeah, he's a fucking dick.

304
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:47,301
-Go inside and tell, uh,
tell Big to square up with him.

305
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:48,703
-All right.
-All right.

306
00:17:50,872 --> 00:17:52,674
How'd it go?

307
00:17:52,774 --> 00:17:54,642
-It went.

308
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:33,681
-Whatcha doing, man?

309
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,818
-Nothing.

310
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,543
-She know you're coming?

311
00:19:02,644 --> 00:19:05,680
-Yep. Just texted her
when we left.

312
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:12,053
All right.
I'll get your bag.

313
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,621
All right.

314
00:19:19,894 --> 00:19:21,129
Hey, what time tonight?

315
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:22,530
-Somewhere around eight.

316
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,865
-All right,
make sure you're awake.

317
00:19:23,965 --> 00:19:25,332
You got a lot of
catching up to do.

318
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:27,300
- Come on, man.

319
00:19:28,736 --> 00:19:30,071
-Hey, Liv.

320
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,205
Vincent.

321
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:34,307
- Hey.

322
00:19:38,012 --> 00:19:39,379
I missed you.

323
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:42,016
- Don't you fucking ever...
- Hey, hey, Liv.

324
00:19:42,116 --> 00:19:43,417
-...fucking do that again.
-Oh, oh.

325
00:19:43,518 --> 00:19:45,586
- Ever.
- I'll see you guys later then.

326
00:19:45,687 --> 00:19:48,221
-Okay, come here, come here,
come here, come here. I'm sorry.

327
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:51,491
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

328
00:19:56,531 --> 00:20:01,669
Jesus Christ, man.
Liv, chill.

329
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:06,641
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Okay? Come on.

330
00:20:09,711 --> 00:20:12,980
Man, you hit hard.
You been working out?

331
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:15,616
Hmm?

332
00:20:15,717 --> 00:20:17,384
Come on,
let's go inside.

333
00:20:22,156 --> 00:20:23,991
Come here, you.

334
00:20:35,503 --> 00:20:36,871
What are you
thinking about?

335
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,643
Don't say "nothing".

336
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:48,750
-Everything.

337
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,854
-One day at a time, baby.

338
00:20:55,623 --> 00:20:58,793
I'm sorry
I had to leave you.

339
00:20:58,893 --> 00:21:00,360
It wasn't fair.

340
00:21:06,868 --> 00:21:09,269
I just can't believe
that day came, you know.

341
00:21:09,837 --> 00:21:13,473
I never thought
it would happen. Ever.

342
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,612
I keep thinking
about his last moments.

343
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:24,051
-You guys have any idea who?

344
00:21:25,686 --> 00:21:26,921
-No.

345
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:30,992
No, not really.

346
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:35,730
There's nothing I can do now
anyway. I just wanna...

347
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:43,004
I don't know what I wanna do.

348
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:46,841
I just wanna move on
with you.

349
00:21:46,941 --> 00:21:48,009
Us.

350
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:54,447
What happened
with Rome before?

351
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:01,354
-You know, it went.

352
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:02,723
That's it.

353
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:10,731
Back to business.

354
00:22:13,634 --> 00:22:17,538
-You know
you can talk to me, Vince.

355
00:22:17,638 --> 00:22:20,373
I'm here, okay?
You keep everything inside.

356
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:23,044
I mean, I'm worried about you.

357
00:22:23,144 --> 00:22:27,882
You know, what happened to Enzo
scares the shit out of me.

358
00:22:27,982 --> 00:22:31,384
Oh, that's
never gonna happen to me.

359
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:33,521
We've got a lot of life
to live, you and me.

360
00:22:37,692 --> 00:22:39,527
I'm not gonna
jeopardize that, okay?

361
00:22:42,296 --> 00:22:43,430
-I know.

362
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:46,968
-Do you?

363
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:54,407
Hey. Come on.

364
00:22:57,511 --> 00:22:59,680
The guys are coming over
in a little while.

365
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,783
Got stuff to talk about tonight.
We'll be down in the basement.

366
00:23:02,884 --> 00:23:03,951
-Already?

367
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:05,253
-We got a lot to go over.

368
00:23:05,353 --> 00:23:06,821
Like?

369
00:23:08,322 --> 00:23:13,460
All right. I'll go get a drink
with Amanda and the girls.

370
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:17,365
The other guys
keep in touch with you or what?

371
00:23:17,464 --> 00:23:20,201
- Yes, almost every single day.
- Good.

372
00:23:20,301 --> 00:23:21,802
-They were worried
about you too.

373
00:23:23,671 --> 00:23:25,606
-What about Rome?
You hear from him?

374
00:23:27,174 --> 00:23:30,443
-Yeah, he sent me
a food basket and some cash.

375
00:23:30,544 --> 00:23:33,480
A few days after you left.

376
00:23:33,581 --> 00:23:36,117
But I felt guilty
spending the money.

377
00:23:36,217 --> 00:23:37,450
-Yeah, don't.

378
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:43,524
I'll make some coffee, you want?

379
00:23:43,624 --> 00:23:45,425
- Sure thing.
- All right.

380
00:24:20,861 --> 00:24:23,531
- That was quick.
- I forgot my phone.

381
00:24:24,732 --> 00:24:26,867
Light and sweet?
- Yes, please.

382
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:44,719
<i>The right hand was cocked then,</i>
<i>but it didn't-- didn't go.</i>

383
00:24:45,052 --> 00:24:47,021
<i>Held it back.</i>
<i>He's waiting for that shot,</i>

384
00:24:47,121 --> 00:24:48,689
<i>and he missed there</i>
<i>with the right hand.</i>

385
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:50,925
<i>He misses that hard right,</i>
<i>missing by a good inch.</i>

386
00:24:51,025 --> 00:24:54,395
<i>The right hand was cocked then,</i>
<i>but it didn't-- didn't go.</i>

387
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:56,430
<i>Held it back.</i>
<i>He's heading for that shot</i>

388
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:57,898
<i>and he missed there</i>
<i>with the right hand.</i>

389
00:24:57,999 --> 00:25:00,101
<i>He misses that hard right,</i>
<i>missing by a good inch.</i>

390
00:25:00,201 --> 00:25:01,936
<i>And he's ready</i>
<i>to stab him with a left</i>

391
00:25:02,036 --> 00:25:03,437
<i>and then to follow</i>
<i>with a right.</i>

392
00:25:03,537 --> 00:25:04,805
<i>But there he missed</i>
<i>with the left,</i>

393
00:25:04,905 --> 00:25:06,140
<i>and got him,</i>

394
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,908
<i>and got a good hard</i>
<i>right to the eye,</i>

395
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:11,479
<i>and then he got another slicing</i>
<i>left hand across the face.</i>

396
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:12,980
<i>Just missed him.</i>

397
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,582
<i>A little further back,</i>
<i>it might have done some damage.</i>

398
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:16,884
<i>Now over there,</i>
<i>in the other corner,</i>

399
00:25:16,984 --> 00:25:19,754
<i>the other neutral corner,</i>
<i>they're in a tangle once again</i>

400
00:25:19,854 --> 00:25:21,956
<i>in the center of the ring.</i>
<i>He's forcing him against--</i>

401
00:25:22,056 --> 00:25:23,157
<i>Vince?</i>

402
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:27,161
<i>Vince?</i>

403
00:25:27,261 --> 00:25:28,963
<i>Vincent!</i>

404
00:25:29,296 --> 00:25:30,765
- What, baby?

405
00:25:30,865 --> 00:25:32,466
The boys are here!

406
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:33,868
-All right.

407
00:25:33,968 --> 00:25:35,603
<i>- very long three minutes</i>

408
00:25:35,703 --> 00:25:37,772
<i>which dropped him in the first</i>
<i>minute of the round.</i>

409
00:25:37,872 --> 00:25:39,907
- Shit.

410
00:25:44,078 --> 00:25:45,913
<i>Yo, man, where's he at?</i>
<i>He downstairs?</i>

411
00:25:46,013 --> 00:25:47,181
<i>Coming down these stairs</i>

412
00:25:47,281 --> 00:25:49,083
<i>is the only family I got left.</i>

413
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:50,484
<i>Shit.</i>

414
00:25:50,584 --> 00:25:52,653
<i>We were raised</i>
<i>together like we were blood.</i>

415
00:25:52,753 --> 00:25:54,188
<i>Brought up like soldiers.</i>

416
00:25:54,288 --> 00:25:55,856
<i>Fucking short jokes, bro.</i>

417
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,962
-Oh, my God, man.
You look good, man.

418
00:26:02,063 --> 00:26:05,733
-All right. Come on.
I'm all right.

419
00:26:07,034 --> 00:26:10,171
Come on, boy.
What's up, baby?

420
00:26:10,271 --> 00:26:11,939
Let's get some
drinks

421
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:14,175
up in here, man.

422
00:26:14,275 --> 00:26:15,643
I got a little.

423
00:26:15,743 --> 00:26:17,778
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you.

424
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,414
-Right.

425
00:26:20,515 --> 00:26:21,949
<i>Marco.</i>

426
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:24,919
<i>His old man was my dad's</i>
<i>right hand for years.</i>

427
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:28,022
<i>Then one day he was just gone.</i>

428
00:26:28,122 --> 00:26:30,958
<i>Dad took Marco in,</i>
<i>and that was that.</i>

429
00:26:31,058 --> 00:26:33,594
<i>I don't really remember</i>
<i>growing up without him.</i>

430
00:26:35,162 --> 00:26:36,964
<i>Donny Mac...</i>

431
00:26:37,064 --> 00:26:38,899
<i>Donny's father</i>
<i>was my dad's best friend,</i>

432
00:26:38,999 --> 00:26:41,335
<i>but he was a fuck-up.</i>
<i>A gambler.</i>

433
00:26:42,504 --> 00:26:45,106
<i>Everyone loved him,</i>
<i>but he owed too many people.</i>

434
00:26:45,206 --> 00:26:46,974
<i>A couple days before</i>
<i>he got whacked,</i>

435
00:26:47,074 --> 00:26:48,709
<i>he begged my dad</i>
<i>to watch over his kid</i>

436
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:51,546
<i>in case anything</i>
<i>happened to him.</i>

437
00:26:51,645 --> 00:26:54,315
<i>I got another brother</i>
<i>when I was 10.</i>

438
00:26:55,816 --> 00:26:59,521
<i>Darius Jackson.</i>
<i>Dude's in the hurt business.</i>

439
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,422
<i>Always has been</i>
<i>since he was young.</i>

440
00:27:01,523 --> 00:27:04,825
<i>He actually held my dad up</i>
<i>when he was 12 at gunpoint.</i>

441
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:06,760
<i>Dad thought</i>
<i>he had a pair of balls,</i>

442
00:27:06,861 --> 00:27:10,631
<i>so he gave him a G and</i>
<i>offered him a job on the spot.</i>

443
00:27:10,731 --> 00:27:12,766
<i>Been with the family</i>
<i>ever since.</i>

444
00:27:14,001 --> 00:27:17,471
<i>And Dobson. He's my cousin.</i>

445
00:27:17,572 --> 00:27:19,240
<i>When my dad's big</i>
<i>brother didn't</i>

446
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,741
<i>come back from the Gulf War,</i>

447
00:27:20,841 --> 00:27:23,177
<i>Dobs became my big brother.</i>

448
00:27:24,445 --> 00:27:25,779
My bad.

449
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,016
-What's with the circle jerk,
guys?

450
00:27:29,116 --> 00:27:30,718
-Waitin' on you, Liv!
Jumpin' in?

451
00:27:30,818 --> 00:27:32,052
-Uh, no. Thank you.

452
00:27:32,153 --> 00:27:35,590
Vin? I'm headed out.
You need anything?

453
00:27:35,689 --> 00:27:36,891
-No, I'm good, baby.

454
00:27:38,292 --> 00:27:40,227
-See you boys later.

455
00:27:42,796 --> 00:27:45,534
-So, when we'd become
the circle jerk boys?

456
00:27:45,634 --> 00:27:48,637
Just now, I guess.

457
00:27:48,736 --> 00:27:51,038
Man, I missed you guys. Shit.

458
00:27:51,138 --> 00:27:52,339
And I'm about to throw
a lot at you,

459
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:54,008
so just bear with me, all right?

460
00:27:54,108 --> 00:27:55,644
Go ahead. What's up?

461
00:27:55,743 --> 00:27:57,311
-Next couple days
are gonna be hot.

462
00:27:58,879 --> 00:28:01,282
I know it's soon,
but tomorrow...

463
00:28:01,382 --> 00:28:02,683
tomorrow we gotta do some work.

464
00:28:02,783 --> 00:28:04,018
-So you're not wasting
no more fucking time, huh?

465
00:28:04,118 --> 00:28:05,753
-Nah, there's no time to waste.

466
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,189
So just hear me out.

467
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:09,757
Okay, you might not be crazy
about what I'm about to say,

468
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:12,661
but, uh-- take my word for it.
It's the only way.

469
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,728
-Go ahead. What's up?

470
00:28:14,828 --> 00:28:16,130
-So as you know,
a couple weeks before Dad died,

471
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,633
he talked to me
about bumping up.

472
00:28:18,732 --> 00:28:20,768
And since him and Rome
were partners,

473
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:22,604
every single business we owned,

474
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:25,773
bakery, car wash,
the laundromat,

475
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:28,175
everything was co-owned
by the both of them on paper.

476
00:28:28,275 --> 00:28:31,580
Half of that was supposed to be
transitioned over to my name.

477
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,848
So Dad and Rome
had a sit-down.

478
00:28:36,016 --> 00:28:38,485
And Rome wasn't having it.

479
00:28:38,587 --> 00:28:40,221
They had a big
disagreement, man.

480
00:28:42,756 --> 00:28:44,526
He said he saw a shift
in him that night

481
00:28:44,626 --> 00:28:46,060
that he never saw before.

482
00:28:47,761 --> 00:28:49,396
He kept eyes on him,
and he started noticing

483
00:28:49,496 --> 00:28:51,999
money getting moved around
the way it shouldn't have been.

484
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:53,668
So he checked into it,
he looked at Rome's books,

485
00:28:53,767 --> 00:28:55,236
and sure enough, he was right.

486
00:28:55,336 --> 00:28:56,705
There was a couple
big money transactions

487
00:28:56,804 --> 00:28:59,840
that were never approved.

488
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,676
And that never happened

489
00:29:01,775 --> 00:29:04,044
in all the years
they were working together.

490
00:29:04,144 --> 00:29:07,214
So he felt it.
He knew it. He saw it.

491
00:29:13,821 --> 00:29:18,058
I fucking know
that Rome saw his chance

492
00:29:18,158 --> 00:29:20,294
and he made his move.
I know it.

493
00:29:22,631 --> 00:29:23,931
I know it was him.

494
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:27,569
Get the fuck out of here.

495
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:29,870
-Rome's gotta go.

496
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,972
-Motherfucker.

497
00:29:32,072 --> 00:29:34,041
-I swear I had a feeling.

498
00:29:34,141 --> 00:29:34,908
-Yeah.

499
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:36,243
-I was fighting it.

500
00:29:36,343 --> 00:29:38,045
So we jump too soon,
we got nothing.

501
00:29:38,145 --> 00:29:39,547
All the money's
tied up with him...

502
00:29:39,648 --> 00:29:40,814
in who the fuck knows what.

503
00:29:40,914 --> 00:29:41,982
So wherever he goes,
the money goes too.

504
00:29:42,082 --> 00:29:44,218
So right now,
it's off the table.

505
00:29:44,318 --> 00:29:45,786
Damn, Vin.

506
00:29:45,886 --> 00:29:47,121
I was hoping
we could work tonight.

507
00:29:47,221 --> 00:29:48,757
No, we can't.
We just can't.

508
00:29:48,856 --> 00:29:49,890
Fuck, man.

509
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,259
So I got a plan.

510
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:55,162
So to start, Sasso.

511
00:29:55,262 --> 00:29:57,464
Sasso asked me
to buy into the bar.

512
00:29:57,565 --> 00:29:59,701
He wants me to buy out Rome.

513
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,168
He just found out Rome
was skimming off the top

514
00:30:01,268 --> 00:30:04,104
for the past two years
and he is not happy about it.

515
00:30:04,204 --> 00:30:06,907
So I buy into the bar,
I take care of it. All right?

516
00:30:07,007 --> 00:30:09,476
Not asking you guys
to dip in on that.

517
00:30:09,577 --> 00:30:11,780
Then we got weekly income.

518
00:30:11,879 --> 00:30:13,380
We got a place of business,
we got a start.

519
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,517
It's not a lot of money,
but it's something.

520
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:19,587
And there's more. Dobs.

521
00:30:22,056 --> 00:30:26,327
-Couple of days
after Enzo passed...

522
00:30:26,427 --> 00:30:30,632
I was thinking a lot about what
Vincent's talking about now.

523
00:30:30,732 --> 00:30:35,035
Us not having revenue.
It's just not an option.

524
00:30:35,135 --> 00:30:37,471
Us going on like we have been,
it's not an option either.

525
00:30:37,572 --> 00:30:39,006
-Mm-hm.

526
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:41,509
-D, you remember my cousin
Michael from New York?

527
00:30:43,143 --> 00:30:48,015
-Yeah. Big boy with the hog.
Got a nice little crew with him.

528
00:30:48,115 --> 00:30:50,117
Michael's been trying
to push with Enzo for a while.

529
00:30:50,217 --> 00:30:52,453
Being that we're loyal
to our connects upstate,

530
00:30:52,554 --> 00:30:55,222
we just never did it.

531
00:30:55,322 --> 00:30:58,492
Now, the product's getting hot.

532
00:30:58,593 --> 00:31:01,895
And they're in desperate need
for someone to push it.

533
00:31:01,995 --> 00:31:03,864
What's the name?

534
00:31:03,964 --> 00:31:05,734
-It's called PRYDE.

535
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:07,301
-Pride, huh?

536
00:31:07,401 --> 00:31:09,970
And it's selling like
water during a drought.

537
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,306
P-R-Y-D-E.
- Wait a minute.

538
00:31:12,406 --> 00:31:14,709
So you're saying we're
gonna be "selling Pride"?

539
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:16,377
That's kind of
a weird thing to say, no?

540
00:31:16,477 --> 00:31:18,145
Listen,

541
00:31:18,245 --> 00:31:19,913
call it whatever the fuck
you wanna call it.

542
00:31:20,013 --> 00:31:21,882
Call it Jesus Christ
for all I care.

543
00:31:21,982 --> 00:31:25,854
Name doesn't matter.
What matters is that it sells...

544
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:27,522
Guys, we get our hands
on this product--

545
00:31:27,622 --> 00:31:29,123
-We bust a move...

546
00:31:30,891 --> 00:31:33,360
Then we in business on our own?

547
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,995
I'm gonna
talk to him tonight.

548
00:31:35,095 --> 00:31:36,997
I'll get some details
and I'll let you guys know.

549
00:31:37,097 --> 00:31:39,199
-How much we buying for?

550
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:41,001
-A mil.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

551
00:31:41,101 --> 00:31:42,704
A mil?
- Damn.

552
00:31:42,804 --> 00:31:44,639
-That's fucking steep, no?

553
00:31:44,739 --> 00:31:45,807
-We can handle it.

554
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:48,142
-How the fuck
we pulling that off?

555
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:50,812
Oh, Vin, all my shit's
tied up right now.

556
00:31:50,911 --> 00:31:52,514
I don't got a fifth of that
laying around.

557
00:31:52,614 --> 00:31:54,582
-And we can't get
a small load to start?

558
00:31:54,682 --> 00:31:55,650
-We'll be all right.

559
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,184
-How?

560
00:31:58,185 --> 00:31:59,319
-'Cause I sat down with Rome
this morning.

561
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,021
-Wait, what the fuck
did you do, man?

562
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:02,122
-Why the fuck would you do
some dumb shit like that?

563
00:32:02,222 --> 00:32:03,490
-Chill.
-What the fuck?

564
00:32:03,591 --> 00:32:04,859
-Okay, I was with him.

565
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:06,326
Should have
fucking said something.

566
00:32:06,427 --> 00:32:07,294
-Alright, he talked to the cunt.
He straightened it out.

567
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,130
-You should have took
all of us with you, Vin.

568
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:13,200
-How the fuck am I gonna
take you all with me?

569
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:16,838
I could barely control myself in
front of that motherfucker, man.

570
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:18,873
No, he's right though.

571
00:32:18,972 --> 00:32:20,742
'Cause I would have
killed that motherfucker.

572
00:32:20,842 --> 00:32:22,276
-Look, it's done.

573
00:32:22,376 --> 00:32:24,278
-So you're telling me you just
sat with Rome and talked?

574
00:32:24,378 --> 00:32:25,880
-Yeah.

575
00:32:25,979 --> 00:32:27,181
-First time you talked
since the funeral?

576
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:28,482
-Yeah.

577
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:30,919
-I'm guessing you must have
talked about Enzo, right?

578
00:32:31,018 --> 00:32:32,520
-Yeah.

579
00:32:33,922 --> 00:32:35,790
He said he knows who did it,
but he didn't want to tell me

580
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:37,792
in case I retaliated.
-Fucking coward.

581
00:32:37,892 --> 00:32:39,359
-'Cause he know we were gonna
murder that motherfucker.

582
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,994
-Fellas! Fellas,
you gotta stop, all right?

583
00:32:41,094 --> 00:32:43,130
It's taking every ounce
of energy in me to be cool.

584
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,232
Just fucking stop.

585
00:32:45,332 --> 00:32:47,735
-Vin, we got it. Go ahead.

586
00:32:50,505 --> 00:32:55,175
-Tomorrow.
Tomorrow's a big day.

587
00:32:55,275 --> 00:32:57,645
Rome gave me a suitcase
with 250K to buy powder

588
00:32:57,745 --> 00:33:00,080
off our main supplier, Butchie.

589
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,716
The deal is to go there,
grab the powder,

590
00:33:01,816 --> 00:33:03,317
and keep that fucking cash.

591
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:06,253
We're doing the deal under Rome,
so he'll have to answer for it.

592
00:33:06,353 --> 00:33:08,857
And then, we have
a really big money pickup

593
00:33:08,957 --> 00:33:10,190
with our dealer
from North Jersey.

594
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:13,260
We're looking at 550K.

595
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,629
So I scheduled both
at the same time;

596
00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:15,996
we're splittin' up.

597
00:33:16,096 --> 00:33:17,599
Works in our favor
because by the time

598
00:33:17,699 --> 00:33:20,033
we're done ripping off Butchie,
you guys will already be done.

599
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,303
You see where
I'm going with this?

600
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:25,940
Now we're talking,
we got powder to push,

601
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:27,307
we got 800K in our pocket.

602
00:33:27,407 --> 00:33:28,843
We match up internally
with 200K,

603
00:33:28,943 --> 00:33:30,512
we're in business
with the PRYDE.

604
00:33:30,612 --> 00:33:32,647
I'm gonna roll with Dobs,
we're gonna go handle Butchie.

605
00:33:32,747 --> 00:33:33,982
You guys are gonna get together,

606
00:33:34,081 --> 00:33:35,650
you're gonna meet with
this jerk-off named Guy.

607
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,619
He's a shady motherfucker.

608
00:33:37,719 --> 00:33:40,153
So you need a little more
manpower there, just in case.

609
00:33:42,222 --> 00:33:46,326
All this happens first.
Tomorrow.

610
00:33:49,797 --> 00:33:52,132
And then we deal with Rome.

611
00:34:18,893 --> 00:34:20,528
That's it? Nothing?

612
00:34:20,628 --> 00:34:21,963
-I didn't know
you were done, Vin.

613
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:23,096
I figured I'd just
keep my mouth shut.

614
00:34:23,196 --> 00:34:25,065
Yeah, that's it.

615
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,236
-That's a tall order there, Vin.

616
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:32,306
-We can handle it.

617
00:34:32,406 --> 00:34:35,175
-We gotta duck out
for a minute if we do this.

618
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:37,444
-It's the only way, huh?

619
00:34:37,545 --> 00:34:38,646
-Yeah.

620
00:34:38,746 --> 00:34:44,284
-Well... About time
we run this shit.

621
00:34:44,384 --> 00:34:46,754
All right.

622
00:34:46,854 --> 00:34:48,056
Donny?

623
00:34:48,188 --> 00:34:49,624
-I'm down, Vin.

624
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:52,760
-Marco.

625
00:34:54,062 --> 00:34:55,563
-You gotta ask me?

626
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,534
-All right.

627
00:35:01,603 --> 00:35:02,604
All right.

628
00:35:03,938 --> 00:35:07,441
This time tomorrow night,
everything's gonna be changed.

629
00:35:07,542 --> 00:35:10,110
We don't answer to nobody
no more. That's it.

630
00:35:11,378 --> 00:35:14,114
Go pack your bags tonight.
'Cause after we do this shit,

631
00:35:14,214 --> 00:35:16,050
we're gonna head
to the cabin, all right?

632
00:35:16,149 --> 00:35:21,556
Lay low for a little bit.
Figure things out.

633
00:35:21,656 --> 00:35:23,256
'Cause Rome's next.

634
00:35:23,357 --> 00:35:24,959
Nighty-night, Rome.

635
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:26,894
-Take back what's ours.

636
00:35:26,995 --> 00:35:27,996
-To that, brotha.

637
00:35:28,096 --> 00:35:29,564
Take back what's ours.

638
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,166
-Take it all.

639
00:35:42,577 --> 00:35:43,978
-Later, Vin.
-All right, buddy.

640
00:35:44,078 --> 00:35:46,346
Watch out for
that black ice, man.

641
00:35:46,446 --> 00:35:47,849
-See you tomorrow.
-All right.

642
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:49,216
Be good.

643
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,418
- We, good, mate.
- All right.

644
00:35:56,758 --> 00:35:58,425
Yeah. Lemme get...

645
00:36:02,864 --> 00:36:04,431
Nice.

646
00:36:06,466 --> 00:36:08,201
-Cold as shit, huh?
-Mm-hmm.

647
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:27,320
-How you holdin'?

648
00:36:30,223 --> 00:36:31,391
-I'm all right.

649
00:36:32,694 --> 00:36:33,661
-Yeah?

650
00:36:33,761 --> 00:36:35,195
-Yeah.

651
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,575
-We miss him.

652
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,243
-Yeah, I know.

653
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,587
What's up?

654
00:36:59,687 --> 00:37:02,924
-So we really doing this, huh?

655
00:37:03,024 --> 00:37:03,958
-Yeah.

656
00:37:07,294 --> 00:37:08,563
-She know?

657
00:37:10,932 --> 00:37:11,966
-No.

658
00:37:20,608 --> 00:37:22,409
You don't think
it's gonna work, huh?

659
00:37:26,581 --> 00:37:28,516
-You had time
to think about this.

660
00:37:30,118 --> 00:37:31,251
-Yeah.

661
00:37:32,987 --> 00:37:34,421
-Yeah, we didn't.

662
00:37:43,631 --> 00:37:46,634
-We'll be all right, dude.

663
00:37:46,734 --> 00:37:48,936
-Yeah?

664
00:37:49,036 --> 00:37:52,073
-We'll be all right.

665
00:37:52,173 --> 00:37:54,175
Get some sleep. Come on.

666
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:55,475
-All right.

667
00:37:56,409 --> 00:37:57,912
Hey, I'll see you there.

668
00:41:53,014 --> 00:41:55,783
<i>No, that's tomorrow.</i>
<i>We'll figure it out, all right?</i>

669
00:41:57,184 --> 00:41:58,786
Later on, yeah?

670
00:41:58,886 --> 00:42:00,554
I'm gonna go meet
this fucking bitch.

671
00:42:00,654 --> 00:42:03,024
Whoa, nice mouth, man.

672
00:42:03,124 --> 00:42:04,091
-What's that?

673
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:06,160
I got a lady here.
It's offensive.

674
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,828
-I'm on the phone,
all right?

675
00:42:07,928 --> 00:42:10,097
Yeah,
but we still heard you.

676
00:42:10,197 --> 00:42:11,399
-I offended you?

677
00:42:11,499 --> 00:42:12,867
Yes, you did.

678
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:16,203
Big, hold on for one second.

679
00:42:16,303 --> 00:42:17,738
Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to offend you, okay?

680
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:19,440
-You didn't. It's really
not that big of a deal.

681
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,975
I don't give a shit.

682
00:42:24,045 --> 00:42:25,646
-I'm sorry, my name is Vincent.
What's your name, man?

683
00:42:25,746 --> 00:42:27,948
It's whatever, man.
My name's Dante.

684
00:42:28,049 --> 00:42:30,251
- Dante? Where you from, man?
- I'm from Los--

685
00:42:30,351 --> 00:42:32,053
Ooh!
- I swear to fucking God,

686
00:42:32,153 --> 00:42:33,821
you're such an idiot.
Every goddamn time

687
00:42:33,921 --> 00:42:35,289
you open your fucking mouth!
-I'll call you later.

688
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:37,691
- What the fuck?
- No, you're a fucking idiot.

689
00:42:40,561 --> 00:42:42,630
- Yo.
- Hey, hold on, Vin.

690
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:43,898
Vin--

691
00:42:43,998 --> 00:42:45,933
- Sasso.
- What up?

692
00:42:46,033 --> 00:42:47,568
-Here, I gotta check for you.
Hold on.

693
00:42:47,668 --> 00:42:48,769
-No, no, no, no. Don't worry
about that right now.

694
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:49,904
-What are you talking about?

695
00:42:50,004 --> 00:42:51,439
-Don't worry about that
right now.

696
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,973
-Let me square up with you.
-Stop, stop, stop. Listen to me.

697
00:42:53,074 --> 00:42:55,109
When a certain someone's hand
is off my neck,

698
00:42:55,209 --> 00:42:57,845
that's worth like six months.
Capiche?

699
00:42:57,945 --> 00:42:59,080
-You sure?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

700
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,681
You're doing me a favor.

701
00:43:00,781 --> 00:43:03,584
Locks are changed, doors open
when everything's clear.

702
00:43:03,684 --> 00:43:06,821
Listen to me. Be careful.

703
00:43:06,921 --> 00:43:09,090
-All right. Thank you, man.

704
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:12,193
You got that?
Be careful.

705
00:43:17,431 --> 00:43:18,999
Okay. Y'all sleep?

706
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,067
-Yeah.

707
00:43:20,167 --> 00:43:21,769
- A little bit.
- Yeah, me too.

708
00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:22,837
Bags packed?

709
00:43:22,937 --> 00:43:24,371
-Bags are packed
and ready to go.

710
00:43:24,472 --> 00:43:25,473
-Marco, you got the address?

711
00:43:25,574 --> 00:43:27,542
-Yep. About 30 from here.

712
00:43:27,641 --> 00:43:29,076
-It's about the same for us.

713
00:43:29,176 --> 00:43:30,878
-All right.

714
00:43:30,978 --> 00:43:32,346
Just give me a shout
when you get out of there.

715
00:43:32,446 --> 00:43:35,049
Just make sure you keep
an eye out for tails, all right?

716
00:43:35,149 --> 00:43:37,852
All right,
I think that's about it.

717
00:43:37,952 --> 00:43:39,320
-Gotta water the flowers, man.
Give me a minute.

718
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,591
Yeah.

719
00:43:42,723 --> 00:43:44,258
-Dobs, you fueled up?

720
00:43:46,595 --> 00:43:49,196
- Hey, Liv.

721
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:50,532
Wait, what?

722
00:43:50,631 --> 00:43:51,866
<i>What's going on?</i>

723
00:43:53,568 --> 00:43:54,735
-Liv, I can't tell you
right now, honey.

724
00:43:54,835 --> 00:43:56,003
Just go pack a bag.

725
00:43:56,103 --> 00:43:57,471
-Yeah, I'm-- I'm not
going to the cabin.

726
00:43:57,572 --> 00:43:59,306
-Olivia, pack a bag.

727
00:43:59,406 --> 00:44:01,742
<i>I'm not</i>
<i>going to the fucking cabin.</i>

728
00:44:01,842 --> 00:44:05,913
I have a life.
You don't tell me anything.

729
00:44:06,013 --> 00:44:09,083
You just got back from there.
Why are you going back, huh?

730
00:44:09,183 --> 00:44:10,885
-Look, I just-- I can't tell you
right now, baby, all right?

731
00:44:10,985 --> 00:44:13,320
-When can you talk about it?
-Not now!

732
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,755
Vin.

733
00:44:14,855 --> 00:44:17,491
It's time to roll.

734
00:44:17,592 --> 00:44:18,826
-I got to do this, okay?

735
00:44:18,926 --> 00:44:20,529
I got to keep you safe,
and this has to happen.

736
00:44:20,629 --> 00:44:22,096
So please, honey,
just go pack a bag.

737
00:44:22,196 --> 00:44:23,364
<i>Take care of me?</i>

738
00:44:23,464 --> 00:44:25,600
<i>How are you taking care of me?</i>

739
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:27,067
Should I be scared?

740
00:44:27,168 --> 00:44:28,903
-Because it's safer
this way, all right?

741
00:44:29,003 --> 00:44:31,772
-Business
always comes first, right?

742
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,275
<i>Fuck this.</i>

743
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:35,876
I'm going to my mom's.

744
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:38,779
<i>Are you there?</i>

745
00:44:38,879 --> 00:44:41,248
-Yeah, I'm here. Um--

746
00:44:41,348 --> 00:44:43,652
all right, just go to your--
go to your mother's

747
00:44:43,751 --> 00:44:48,289
and I'll call you when--
I'll call you later. Okay?

748
00:44:50,157 --> 00:44:53,194
Olivia? Oliv--

749
00:44:54,762 --> 00:44:55,963
That's why I'm single.

750
00:44:56,063 --> 00:44:58,832
- Nah, it's just...

751
00:44:58,933 --> 00:45:00,201
it's hard on her,
this shit, man.

752
00:45:00,301 --> 00:45:01,368
It takes its toll.

753
00:45:09,176 --> 00:45:10,211
All right.

754
00:45:31,999 --> 00:45:32,900
D, you are right
around the corner

755
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,135
from the Parkway, man.

756
00:45:35,236 --> 00:45:38,138
Just give me a call
when it's all clear, okay?

757
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:39,240
-Yeah, you got it.

758
00:45:46,514 --> 00:45:47,448
-We good?

759
00:45:51,085 --> 00:45:52,953
All right, let's do it.

760
00:47:18,072 --> 00:47:19,340
Tripping, are we early?

761
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,642
Nah, pull around back.

762
00:47:20,742 --> 00:47:22,242
I've been here before with Dobs.

763
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:34,121
Circles around back over there.

764
00:47:44,766 --> 00:47:46,033
-Yeah, it's right up here.

765
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:49,269
You know, I never
really liked these guys.

766
00:47:51,405 --> 00:47:53,240
-Who do you like?

767
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,509
-No one really.

768
00:47:58,312 --> 00:48:00,481
- Ah, fuck.
- What?

769
00:48:02,182 --> 00:48:04,318
I think that's Kate.
That's Darius' cousin.

770
00:48:04,418 --> 00:48:06,755
Which one?

771
00:48:06,855 --> 00:48:08,155
What do you think?

772
00:48:08,255 --> 00:48:12,326
Oh.
Well, it's a good thing, no?

773
00:48:12,426 --> 00:48:15,295
No, it's not.
All right, park here.

774
00:48:18,432 --> 00:48:19,768
What am I supposed to
fucking do with this?

775
00:48:19,868 --> 00:48:21,536
Keep them out of fucking sight?

776
00:48:21,636 --> 00:48:22,570
-All right.

777
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:25,172
-Yup. Let's do this.

778
00:48:26,641 --> 00:48:28,275
No, I'm gonna kick
his fucking friend in the face.

779
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:31,412
That's what happens.
The kid's a fucking retard.

780
00:48:31,513 --> 00:48:33,247
He has your fucking DNA.
- What's up, man?

781
00:48:33,347 --> 00:48:35,015
Look, look, where
the fuck they fucking going?

782
00:48:35,115 --> 00:48:36,551
Listen, I gotta go.
I got fucking people coming in.

783
00:48:36,651 --> 00:48:37,685
-I'm good.

784
00:48:37,786 --> 00:48:38,787
No, I gotta fuckin' go

785
00:48:39,052 --> 00:48:40,954
because you're making
no fucking sense.

786
00:48:45,894 --> 00:48:47,261
Vincent.

787
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:50,431
-There's our friend.

788
00:49:24,566 --> 00:49:27,301
-Come on, D-Mac.

789
00:49:27,401 --> 00:49:30,404
-Man, it's a big pickup
for one guy.

790
00:49:30,505 --> 00:49:34,809
-Yeah. Well, let's
get in and out fast.

791
00:49:34,909 --> 00:49:37,846
Yo, stay cocked and loaded.

792
00:49:37,946 --> 00:49:41,415
-I got the warehouse.
-Yep.

793
00:49:57,397 --> 00:50:00,100
What's your favorite
movie?

794
00:50:00,735 --> 00:50:02,604
- <i>Bambi</i> .

795
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:11,411
You guys hit traffic
on the way down here?

796
00:50:11,513 --> 00:50:13,180
Ah, Christ.

797
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,350
-Nah. It was pretty wide open.

798
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:20,220
-Parkway was a fucking bitch.
Ah.

799
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,222
Watch your shoes
all over here, all right?

800
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:27,094
<i>Bambi</i> , you still watch that?

801
00:50:27,194 --> 00:50:28,295
I showed that movie
to my kids, you know?

802
00:50:28,395 --> 00:50:30,063
It's kind of a classic there.

803
00:50:31,265 --> 00:50:32,567
You like that movie?

804
00:50:34,468 --> 00:50:37,204
Ah, pardon me for asking.
Seems like you would.

805
00:50:37,304 --> 00:50:41,241
It's kind of a-- kind of
a woke movie, don't you think?

806
00:50:41,341 --> 00:50:45,345
You got like an artistic rabbit
friend, faggot skunk friend.

807
00:50:45,445 --> 00:50:47,447
That stuff doesn't
appeal to you, no?

808
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:51,251
I'm so sorry
about your father.

809
00:50:51,351 --> 00:50:52,319
He was a good man.
- Thanks, man.

810
00:50:52,419 --> 00:50:54,321
-I respected him so much.

811
00:50:54,421 --> 00:50:55,790
These fucking animals
these days,

812
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:57,224
I want you to know one thing.

813
00:50:57,324 --> 00:50:59,661
I respect you, too.
I don't like Rome too much,

814
00:50:59,761 --> 00:51:01,495
but I'm gonna work with you
because of you.

815
00:51:01,596 --> 00:51:03,196
You got my word on it.
-I appreciate that, man.

816
00:51:03,297 --> 00:51:04,599
-You understand?
There's just one little thing.

817
00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:06,500
Please--

818
00:51:06,601 --> 00:51:10,137
Don't fucking move!
Do not move!

819
00:51:10,237 --> 00:51:11,940
Drop your fucking pieces.

820
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,240
You're
fucking dead, bitch!

821
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,642
- Drop!
- I'm gonna fucking

822
00:51:14,742 --> 00:51:16,209
bury you next to your father,
you motherfucker!

823
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:17,579
Don't fucking move.

824
00:51:19,914 --> 00:51:21,481
-Here we go. You got kids?

825
00:51:21,583 --> 00:51:23,317
-Nah, I got a nephew.
That's good enough.

826
00:51:23,417 --> 00:51:26,688
-Yeah.
Well, that's a good thing.

827
00:51:26,788 --> 00:51:29,323
Ah, shit.
Fuckin' bag.

828
00:51:30,792 --> 00:51:33,861
One thing after another
with that life, man.

829
00:51:34,194 --> 00:51:35,663
PTA meetings...

830
00:51:37,197 --> 00:51:38,533
Bedtime stories.

831
00:51:38,633 --> 00:51:42,036
You know what I read to
my kids as a bedtime story?

832
00:51:42,135 --> 00:51:44,539
If you care, the newspaper.

833
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:47,207
I want my kids to know what
this life is about, you know?

834
00:51:47,307 --> 00:51:48,810
See some Syrian kid
wash up on the beach,

835
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:51,679
I'm like, you know, that's why
I give you swimming lessons.

836
00:52:03,791 --> 00:52:05,827
You motherfucker!
Come on, motherfucker!

837
00:52:11,699 --> 00:52:13,233
Fuck.

838
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:16,738
I see you, motherfucker!
Fuck you, motherfucker!

839
00:52:16,838 --> 00:52:17,805
D, get the bag!

840
00:52:18,773 --> 00:52:19,907
Get the fucking bag!

841
00:52:24,411 --> 00:52:25,312
- Let's go.
- Shit! Ah!

842
00:52:25,412 --> 00:52:26,547
Come on, Marco!

843
00:52:28,448 --> 00:52:30,183
Come on! Come on! Let's go!

844
00:52:34,122 --> 00:52:35,857
Come on!

845
00:52:35,957 --> 00:52:36,958
Donny, come on!

846
00:52:38,826 --> 00:52:40,762
-Come on, Donny!

847
00:52:48,102 --> 00:52:50,270
Motherfucker! Huh?!

848
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:52,305
He tried to
fucking set us up.

849
00:52:52,406 --> 00:52:54,241
Huh? They get the fuck
what they deserve!

850
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:56,443
You good, Donny?-

851
00:52:56,544 --> 00:52:59,147
Donny! You good?

852
00:52:59,246 --> 00:53:00,581
Yo, what the fuck,
Donny?

853
00:53:00,682 --> 00:53:02,817
I'm gonna fucking
bury you, motherfucker!

854
00:53:02,917 --> 00:53:04,719
Eat that shit!
You think I didn't know

855
00:53:04,819 --> 00:53:06,186
you were takin' off the top
every fucking deal?

856
00:53:06,353 --> 00:53:08,022
- Don't move.
- You're a dead man!

857
00:53:08,589 --> 00:53:11,125
I'm gonna fucking bury you.
What the fuck!

858
00:53:11,224 --> 00:53:13,326
Are you fucking kidding?

859
00:53:13,427 --> 00:53:15,328
You're a dead man, bitch!

860
00:53:39,187 --> 00:53:44,257
You mother... fucker!

861
00:53:48,563 --> 00:53:49,831
That's my fucking ear!

862
00:53:54,869 --> 00:53:56,137
My fucking ear!

863
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:04,579
Fuck.

864
00:56:12,573 --> 00:56:13,808
Dobs?

865
00:56:19,146 --> 00:56:20,380
Dobs?

866
00:56:29,824 --> 00:56:33,661
You fuck! I thought
you were fucking dead!

867
00:56:37,598 --> 00:56:39,300
This fucking hurts.

868
00:56:39,399 --> 00:56:41,068
It went through
like last time.

869
00:56:41,168 --> 00:56:43,504
-Yeah?
-Jesus fucking Christ.

870
00:56:47,407 --> 00:56:50,745
You wanna go
to the hospital?

871
00:56:50,845 --> 00:56:51,579
-Ah, fuck it.

872
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:53,347
-Let me get you out of here.

873
00:56:53,446 --> 00:56:57,351
Jesus fucking Christ.
Hold up. Hold up. Ready?

874
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:59,253
You all right? Ready?

875
00:56:59,353 --> 00:57:00,521
Up.

876
00:57:00,621 --> 00:57:04,025
Up. Up. Up.

877
00:57:05,326 --> 00:57:07,628
Sorry. Stand still.

878
00:57:07,728 --> 00:57:09,230
Hold on.

879
00:57:10,463 --> 00:57:13,067
Hold on, okay.

880
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,174
Hold on.

881
00:57:21,876 --> 00:57:24,378
Okay. You ready?
- Yeah.

882
00:57:24,477 --> 00:57:25,980
-Come on.
-Yeah.

883
00:57:32,553 --> 00:57:33,721
What about him?

884
00:57:38,426 --> 00:57:40,661
Fuck him.

885
00:57:58,612 --> 00:58:01,382
Donny, what the fuck
did you do?

886
00:58:01,481 --> 00:58:02,583
Oh, my fucking...
Come on, papi.

887
00:58:02,683 --> 00:58:05,653
Let me see. Let me see.
Fuck. Oh, shit!

888
00:58:05,753 --> 00:58:07,221
You gotta
put pressure on that shit.

889
00:58:07,321 --> 00:58:08,622
You gotta stop the bleeding.

890
00:58:08,723 --> 00:58:11,192
-Donny, it missed
your fucking throat. Oh, my God.

891
00:58:11,292 --> 00:58:12,727
Fuck that.

892
00:58:12,827 --> 00:58:15,663
Fuck, we gotta stop
this fucking bleeding, man.

893
00:58:15,763 --> 00:58:18,599
- Whoo!
- Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

894
00:58:18,699 --> 00:58:20,735
This on there, man.
Hold this tight.

895
00:58:20,835 --> 00:58:23,971
Tight, Donny, all right?
Look at me. You good?

896
00:58:24,071 --> 00:58:25,272
-Shit burns, man.

897
00:58:25,373 --> 00:58:28,943
-Ah. Fuck, that was close.
You fucking asshole. You...

898
00:58:29,043 --> 00:58:31,545
- Quietest I ever heard you,
motherfucker.

899
00:58:31,645 --> 00:58:33,014
-Fuck man.
Fuck you, asshole.

900
00:58:33,114 --> 00:58:35,750
-Stop fucking around
and hold this shit tight, Donny.

901
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:37,718
- Woo-hoo!
- Fuck!

902
00:58:37,818 --> 00:58:40,221
Tell you what,
we got the fucking money!

903
00:58:40,321 --> 00:58:43,391
We got
the fucking money, Donny.

904
00:58:43,491 --> 00:58:44,892
-I'm gonna buy a hooker
after this.

905
00:58:44,992 --> 00:58:46,327
I just wanna own one.

906
00:58:46,427 --> 00:58:47,962
Geez, man, you always
talking this slave shit.

907
00:58:48,062 --> 00:58:49,530
Nah, nah, white girl.

908
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:52,800
Nah, you know what?
Then you get two.

909
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:55,336
And you get one.
And you get one.

910
00:58:55,436 --> 00:59:00,041
- Everybody get a white girl.

911
00:59:00,141 --> 00:59:02,810
Yo, hold that shit
fucking tight, bro.

912
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:05,813
Shit.
Yo, let me call Vin,

913
00:59:05,913 --> 00:59:07,882
see where the fuck
he's at right now.

914
00:59:14,622 --> 00:59:16,957
-My fucking teeth are loose.

915
00:59:17,058 --> 00:59:19,026
-I'll trade you.

916
00:59:19,126 --> 00:59:21,228
-How you holdin'?
You all right?

917
00:59:21,328 --> 00:59:23,532
-Yeah, I'm holding.

918
00:59:23,631 --> 00:59:25,633
-That shit'll kick in quick.

919
00:59:25,733 --> 00:59:28,803
Yeah.

920
00:59:31,038 --> 00:59:35,544
-Come on, D.
Hey, give me some good news.

921
00:59:35,643 --> 00:59:37,044
-We got the fucking money.

922
00:59:37,144 --> 00:59:39,246
But, you know,
shit went a little left,

923
00:59:39,346 --> 00:59:41,715
you know what I'm saying?
Rome fucking tried to set us up.

924
00:59:41,816 --> 00:59:43,350
-What are you-- what are you--
what are you talking about?

925
00:59:43,451 --> 00:59:45,286
<i>They got</i>
<i>the fucking jump on us, man.</i>

926
00:59:45,386 --> 00:59:48,689
<i>Fucking shot Donny,</i>
<i>fucking Marco got hit on, man.</i>

927
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:50,458
<i>We fucking banged up over here.</i>

928
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:52,893
But we making our fucking way
up to the cabin now, so--

929
00:59:52,993 --> 00:59:54,228
-Oh, shit!

930
00:59:54,328 --> 00:59:55,896
-What about you, huh?

931
00:59:55,996 --> 00:59:58,299
-Yeah, it went south
over here too.

932
00:59:58,399 --> 01:00:00,634
We got the money and the powder,
but Dobsie caught one.

933
01:00:00,734 --> 01:00:01,702
It went right through.

934
01:00:01,802 --> 01:00:04,004
-Fuck! These motherfuckers!

935
01:00:04,105 --> 01:00:06,006
How we don't see this shit,
man, huh?

936
01:00:06,107 --> 01:00:07,542
<i>They--</i>
they fucking setting us up

937
01:00:07,641 --> 01:00:09,210
<i>while we setting them up?</i>

938
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:10,377
-I should've seen it.

939
01:00:12,146 --> 01:00:14,782
I should've--
I should've fucking knew.

940
01:00:14,882 --> 01:00:18,185
-Dirty motherfuckers aside,
it's behind us. We good now.

941
01:00:18,285 --> 01:00:20,855
We sitting
prettier than a motherfucker

942
01:00:20,955 --> 01:00:24,425

943
01:00:24,526 --> 01:00:26,160
Yo, how far you out?

944
01:00:27,261 --> 01:00:29,263
-A little over two hours.
What about you?

945
01:00:29,363 --> 01:00:31,566
<i>Yeah, about a fucking hour.</i>

946
01:00:31,665 --> 01:00:33,467
-All right. See you there.

947
01:00:33,568 --> 01:00:36,103
- Yo, D.
<i>- Yo.</i>

948
01:00:36,203 --> 01:00:38,005
-Check that bag?

949
01:00:53,522 --> 01:00:58,292
-Vin... no-go.

950
01:00:58,392 --> 01:00:59,727
They got us.

951
01:01:10,505 --> 01:01:11,772
-It's good, Vin.

952
01:01:13,774 --> 01:01:16,410
We got the money.
We got the powder.

953
01:01:17,546 --> 01:01:19,713
We'll cash in.

954
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:30,124
-How long is that gonna take?

955
01:01:30,224 --> 01:01:31,759
We needed that cash.

956
01:01:34,529 --> 01:01:36,730
I'll call my cousin.

957
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:39,033
It's a smaller order,
but better than nothing.

958
01:01:43,638 --> 01:01:45,072
-All right, fuck it, man.

959
01:01:47,808 --> 01:01:50,211
Marco, fuck it.
It is what it is.

960
01:01:50,311 --> 01:01:51,812
<i>Just get back on the road,</i>
<i>head back to the cabin.</i>

961
01:01:51,946 --> 01:01:53,314
<i>Is Donny all right?</i>

962
01:01:53,414 --> 01:01:55,482
-Yeah, he's okay.

963
01:01:55,584 --> 01:01:57,619
<i>All right, we'll see you there.</i>

964
01:01:57,718 --> 01:02:00,254
-All right. Peace.

965
01:02:41,895 --> 01:02:43,864
Dobs, you all right? Hey.

966
01:02:43,964 --> 01:02:45,734
It's fucking dead here, huh?

967
01:02:45,833 --> 01:02:47,468
Sit tight, man.
Just sit tight.

968
01:02:54,008 --> 01:02:55,976
Fuck.

969
01:02:59,748 --> 01:03:01,482
Sit tight, buddy.

970
01:03:07,021 --> 01:03:10,291
-I got you. I got you.
Easy. All right?

971
01:03:10,391 --> 01:03:11,492
You all right?

972
01:03:11,593 --> 01:03:12,826
Easy on, sonny.

973
01:03:15,896 --> 01:03:18,999
It-- it went through his back.

974
01:04:06,447 --> 01:04:09,584
Hey. You all right?
You all right?

975
01:04:09,684 --> 01:04:11,586
Fuck.

976
01:04:12,853 --> 01:04:14,723
You good, Vin?

977
01:04:14,823 --> 01:04:16,256
-Oh, shit. Fuck.

978
01:04:16,357 --> 01:04:17,659
- I think our friends are here.
- What?

979
01:04:17,759 --> 01:04:19,426
Get out of here, man.
No way.

980
01:04:19,527 --> 01:04:21,629
What the fuck?
How the fuck they know we here?

981
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:23,163
I don't know, man.

982
01:04:23,263 --> 01:04:25,299
Oh, this is fucked up,
yo. This is fucked up.

983
01:04:25,399 --> 01:04:26,768
All right,
hold on, hold on. Relax.

984
01:04:26,867 --> 01:04:28,603
Come on, man. Relax, man.

985
01:04:30,337 --> 01:04:31,639
-How the fuck
do they know we here?

986
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:33,107
-Yo man, you watch
your fucking tail?

987
01:04:33,207 --> 01:04:34,776
Of course,
I fucking watched my tail.

988
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:36,778
They fucking follow you?

989
01:04:36,877 --> 01:04:38,912
-All right, relax.
Relax! Hold on.

990
01:04:39,012 --> 01:04:40,247
- Easy, guys.
- Hold on.

991
01:04:41,683 --> 01:04:43,951
Strap up.
Get in the foyer.

992
01:04:44,051 --> 01:04:46,086
Keep your eyes out.
Watch these back windows.

993
01:04:46,186 --> 01:04:47,522
Let's go get some toys.

994
01:05:15,315 --> 01:05:16,618
-I don't think
we should be here, man.

995
01:05:21,021 --> 01:05:22,222
I don't think we should be here.

996
01:05:23,658 --> 01:05:25,727
-Shut the fuck up.

997
01:05:25,827 --> 01:05:27,928
-Flip, what are we
doing here, man?

998
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:32,933
-The man said shut up.

999
01:06:31,024 --> 01:06:32,993
-I see you, nigga.

1000
01:07:06,761 --> 01:07:09,831
No, no, no,
please, please. Vin.

1001
01:07:09,931 --> 01:07:12,032
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1002
01:07:21,543 --> 01:07:23,945
Vin, what the fuck
are you doing? Let's go, Vin.

1003
01:07:24,044 --> 01:07:25,847
Come on, let's get
the fuck out of here.

1004
01:07:25,947 --> 01:07:27,882
Let's go, come on.

1005
01:07:27,982 --> 01:07:30,317
Shit, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

1006
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:15,128
-Hear anything?

1007
01:08:15,228 --> 01:08:16,731
-Nah, nothing.
It's fucking dead.

1008
01:08:16,831 --> 01:08:18,198
<i>All right. Made some coffee.</i>

1009
01:08:18,298 --> 01:08:20,034
<i>I'll bring some out.</i>

1010
01:08:20,133 --> 01:08:21,268
-All right.

1011
01:08:41,022 --> 01:08:42,657
-You want a cup?

1012
01:08:42,757 --> 01:08:44,257
Yeah.

1013
01:08:44,358 --> 01:08:46,360
Yeah.

1014
01:09:18,225 --> 01:09:19,661
<i>Took about a week,</i>

1015
01:09:19,761 --> 01:09:24,966
<i>but we did what was needed.</i>
<i>He knew it was coming.</i>

1016
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:32,674
Fuck you.

1017
01:10:18,251 --> 01:10:19,554
Vincent.

1018
01:10:23,524 --> 01:10:25,459
Why you doing this?

1019
01:10:26,828 --> 01:10:28,863
Listen to me.

1020
01:10:28,963 --> 01:10:34,836
I swear to you, I did not kill
your father, you understand?

1021
01:10:34,936 --> 01:10:36,537
Why would I do that?

1022
01:10:36,637 --> 01:10:39,540
It doesn't make
any fucking sense.

1023
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,509
You're smarter
than this, Vincent.

1024
01:10:41,609 --> 01:10:43,511
Think, think,
why would I do that?

1025
01:10:43,611 --> 01:10:49,584
All of you, think.
I didn't kill your father.

1026
01:10:49,684 --> 01:10:50,852
You understand?

1027
01:10:59,227 --> 01:11:03,598
Fuck you. Fuck you,
you little fucking punk.

1028
01:11:04,264 --> 01:11:06,033
You're wrecking everything.

1029
01:11:07,935 --> 01:11:13,007
You stupid little wreck punk.
Fuck you! Fuck you, man!

1030
01:11:13,107 --> 01:11:14,809
Fuck you, you motherfucker.

1031
01:11:14,909 --> 01:11:17,712
You're a fucking,
you punk fucking idiot.

1032
01:11:17,812 --> 01:11:19,981
Fuck you, you're
wrecking everything.

1033
01:11:20,081 --> 01:11:22,415
You're signing your fucking
death certificates.

1034
01:11:22,517 --> 01:11:25,787
Fuck you! Fuck you too!

1035
01:11:25,887 --> 01:11:26,888
Fuck you!

1036
01:12:24,979 --> 01:12:26,714
<i>I always knew Rome had cash</i>

1037
01:12:26,814 --> 01:12:29,116
<i>all stashed</i>
<i>in the walls of his house.</i>

1038
01:12:32,587 --> 01:12:34,589
<i>We banked about</i>
<i>half a mil off that.</i>

1039
01:12:37,424 --> 01:12:39,794
<i>Got us rolling</i>
<i>in a business with PRYDE.</i>

1040
01:12:53,608 --> 01:12:56,911
<i>We gave him a proper burial</i>
<i>to thank him.</i>

1041
01:13:10,524 --> 01:13:13,060
<i>One last thing to do.</i>

1042
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,796
<i>Something I should have done</i>
<i>a while ago.</i>

1043
01:13:16,964 --> 01:13:19,399
<i>But it was time.</i>

1044
01:13:21,302 --> 01:13:22,670
Did you climb up the wall?

1045
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:24,872
Yeah.-

1046
01:13:26,207 --> 01:13:27,775
An ice lake.

1047
01:13:27,875 --> 01:13:29,043
I'm trying to find it.

1048
01:13:29,143 --> 01:13:31,512
No, it's beautiful.

1049
01:13:31,612 --> 01:13:34,548
And then I could, you know,
I really,

1050
01:13:34,649 --> 01:13:36,449
what I do really want,
I want a really big,

1051
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:38,753
beautiful kitchen
so it's easy to move around.

1052
01:13:38,853 --> 01:13:41,689
- Mm-hmm.
- Nice and wide and open.

1053
01:13:41,789 --> 01:13:44,759
Maybe-- maybe those like,
big garage-like doors.

1054
01:13:44,859 --> 01:13:46,160
You could just um--
there's windows,

1055
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:49,030
where you can walk out
straight up to the patio.

1056
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:50,430
-Oh, the glass doors?

1057
01:13:50,531 --> 01:13:55,403
-Yes, yes!
I do love it here.

1058
01:13:55,502 --> 01:13:58,205
Do you remember
what happened right here?

1059
01:13:58,306 --> 01:13:59,907
Mm-hmm.

1060
01:14:01,075 --> 01:14:02,376
-I remember what happened
on the boat around here.

1061
01:14:02,475 --> 01:14:04,812
Oh my God, shut up.

1062
01:14:11,319 --> 01:14:12,485
-Hey.

1063
01:14:13,587 --> 01:14:14,789
I wanna talk to you.

1064
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:19,760
-This might be it.
Am I a bitch if I cry?

1065
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:21,963
-Nah, you still a bitch, nigga.

1066
01:14:24,532 --> 01:14:26,466
-We've been together
for a while now.

1067
01:14:30,905 --> 01:14:33,040
And you've been there
through all of it with me.

1068
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:35,109
And I just want you to know
I appreciate that.

1069
01:14:42,016 --> 01:14:46,320
It's hard for me to talk
about my business with you.

1070
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:53,160
And it's hard to talk about
my... you know, my feelings.

1071
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:54,528
You know what I mean?

1072
01:14:56,464 --> 01:14:58,299
-Vin, how long I know you?

1073
01:14:58,399 --> 01:15:01,035
-No, no. I know, I know, it's...

1074
01:15:01,135 --> 01:15:04,705
but I gotta say some stuff,
this needs to be said, okay?

1075
01:15:06,707 --> 01:15:10,411
I gotta ask you
a couple things

1076
01:15:10,511 --> 01:15:12,947
before I ask you something.

1077
01:15:13,047 --> 01:15:16,117
- Okay.

1078
01:15:18,919 --> 01:15:25,559
-Um. You know it's not possible
for me to trust anyone

1079
01:15:25,659 --> 01:15:26,894
other than my brothers and you,

1080
01:15:26,994 --> 01:15:28,829
and there's some things
that only you know.

1081
01:15:30,865 --> 01:15:32,566
And I just wanna be completely
open and honest with you

1082
01:15:32,666 --> 01:15:35,836
from this moment on.
We're gonna move forward.

1083
01:15:39,974 --> 01:15:42,043
I gotta ask you,
are you okay with this life?

1084
01:15:44,912 --> 01:15:46,647
-Yes.

1085
01:15:46,747 --> 01:15:49,417
-With what I do?

1086
01:15:49,518 --> 01:15:50,751
-Yes.

1087
01:15:54,221 --> 01:15:55,856
-There are some people
that crossed my path, Liv,

1088
01:15:55,956 --> 01:15:57,691
that aren't around anymore.

1089
01:16:01,395 --> 01:16:02,897
I want you to know that.

1090
01:16:05,866 --> 01:16:07,768
Do you judge me for that?

1091
01:16:07,868 --> 01:16:09,437
-No.

1092
01:16:09,538 --> 01:16:12,306
-Do you resent me for anything?

1093
01:16:12,406 --> 01:16:16,944
-Vin, I know you.
I love you.

1094
01:16:21,082 --> 01:16:23,617
-You know me, huh?

1095
01:16:23,717 --> 01:16:25,052
Yes.

1096
01:16:31,592 --> 01:16:33,027
-I love you too.

1097
01:16:35,796 --> 01:16:37,698
I can't let you get away, baby.

1098
01:16:46,373 --> 01:16:47,675
-I can't let you get away.

1099
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:53,848
-Did you think
I wouldn't find out?

1100
01:16:56,417 --> 01:17:00,087
Hmm? Well, you knew me, right?
You knew me, right?

1101
01:17:04,925 --> 01:17:07,128
Everything good in me
dies with you.

1102
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:22,776
-What the fuck, Vin?
What the fuck, Vin?

1103
01:17:22,877 --> 01:17:24,845
What the fuck did you do, Vin?

1104
01:17:24,945 --> 01:17:26,113
<i>Back to work.</i>

1105
01:17:26,213 --> 01:17:27,982
<i>And Barca, call everyone</i>
<i>who isn't here.</i>

1106
01:17:28,082 --> 01:17:30,885
<i>You know what to tell them.</i>
<i>All right.</i>

1107
01:17:32,554 --> 01:17:33,954
<i>Onto other business.</i>

1108
01:17:34,054 --> 01:17:35,956
-How'd it go with Rome before?

1109
01:17:39,927 --> 01:17:41,996
<i>There's</i>
<i>a piece in the glove box.</i>

1110
01:17:42,096 --> 01:17:43,565
<i>No, I'm all right.</i>

1111
01:17:43,664 --> 01:17:44,832
-I put the GPS on
the other night,

1112
01:17:44,932 --> 01:17:46,066
you're good to go.
-Yeah.

1113
01:17:49,003 --> 01:17:50,838
<i>The other guys</i>
<i>keep in touch with you or what?</i>

1114
01:17:50,938 --> 01:17:53,307
<i>Yes,</i>
<i>almost every single day.</i>

1115
01:17:53,407 --> 01:17:55,176
<i>What about Rome?</i>
<i>You hear from him?</i>

1116
01:17:58,979 --> 01:18:01,282
How do they know we're here?

1117
01:18:01,382 --> 01:18:03,717
-Did they tail you?
You watch your fucking tail?

1118
01:18:03,817 --> 01:18:05,953
<i>I gotta do this, okay?</i>
<i>I gotta keep you safe.</i>

1119
01:18:06,053 --> 01:18:07,254
<i>And this has to happen.</i>

1120
01:18:07,354 --> 01:18:08,923
<i>So please, honey,</i>
<i>just go pack a bag.</i>

1121
01:18:09,023 --> 01:18:10,559
<i>Yeah, I'm--</i>
<i>I'm not going to the cabin.</i>

1122
01:18:10,659 --> 01:18:12,459
-Olivia, pack a bag.

1123
01:18:12,561 --> 01:18:14,828
<i>I'm not</i>
<i>going to the fucking cabin.</i>

1124
01:18:14,929 --> 01:18:16,363
How the fuck
they know we here?

1125
01:18:16,463 --> 01:18:18,667
I don't know, man.

1126
01:19:28,435 --> 01:19:30,804
<i>Before he died,</i>
<i>my father told me</i>

1127
01:19:30,904 --> 01:19:32,973
<i>he threw the ashes</i>
<i>of Donny's and Marco's fathers</i>

1128
01:19:33,073 --> 01:19:35,009
<i>off this jetty...</i>

1129
01:19:36,910 --> 01:19:38,812
<i>after he killed them both.</i>

1130
01:19:45,486 --> 01:19:46,655
<i>I'm not a good man,</i>

1131
01:19:46,755 --> 01:19:49,624
<i>because I wasn't raised</i>
<i>by a good one.</i>

1132
01:20:07,642 --> 01:20:09,076
<i>I'm the boss now.</i>

1133
01:20:10,411 --> 01:20:13,247
<i>And to be a boss, some things</i>
<i>you have to take to your grave.</i>

1134
01:20:50,884 --> 01:20:53,987
<i>He always told me,</i>
<i>take what's yours.</i>

1135
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:03,964
<i>So I did.</i>
