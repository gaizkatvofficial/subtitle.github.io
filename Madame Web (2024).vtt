WEBVTT

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.420
You think we're in close?

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.680
They're almost impossible to find.
No one's ever captured one alive.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.225
I agree to provide
security to you because I

00:01:55.237 --> 00:01:57.200
thought you were close
to fighting the spider.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.263
A little bit worth the
wait. Dead specimens

00:02:01.275 --> 00:02:04.680
show that the peptides
in the spider's venom...

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.760
...basically they supercharge
their cellular structure.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.960
That spider can give superhuman
strength and power like Asarana.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.687
Asarana? The mythical spider
people who run across the

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:23.960
treetops and punish evil men
with their black poison pests?

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.080
I'd like to make my research on
science, not legends, Mr. Stamps.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.240
Those powers are wasted here.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.960
These little spiders have the
potential to cure hundreds of diseases.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.620
Are you okay?

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.180
No. She's trying her best
to keep me from working.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.080
But I'm not gonna let her do that.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.440
I don't wanna live close.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.380
Perhaps you should rest.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.660
I don't have time.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.900
Thank you. For the umbrella.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.800
No!

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.740
Isn't she beautiful? Incredible, isn't it?

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.560
Something so small, so much power.

00:03:56.561 --> 00:03:57.561
Stop!

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.040
What are you doing?
I don't... I don't understand.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.560
I've been searching
for that spider for years.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.520
No, we could help so many people.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.360
I'm interested in helping people. No one
helped me when my family was starting.

00:04:16.015 --> 00:04:19.280
My road was not as clear as yours.
We didn't have the same choices.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.856
You're making the wrong decision.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.000
You're making the wrong decision.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.660
Get it to me.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.280
You can't walk away.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.120
Stop! Stop! Stop!

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.000
Her journey will not be
easy, but she is strong.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.980
She will come back when she
needs answers, and when she does,

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.580
I will be here for that.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.950
This is 210 with a
42-year-old female, 12-3.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.570
Guys, I've lost the pulse.
I'm starting compressions now.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.550
Ben, what are you even doing back there?

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.670
Oh, you wanna come take over? I can drive.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.490
I'm not going where this has gone my way.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.349
I'm not going where this has gone my way.

00:07:07.741 --> 00:07:13.940
You're taking her back there.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.980
Well, last time when the vehicle
drifted like this, I was getting shot at.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.220
I wouldn't want you to be
home, except for the army.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.620
I never thought I'd be this
happy to be back in Queens.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.240
Wait, you better get shot at in Queens?

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:35.900
Shouldn't we go to school?

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.380
Who puts off it anyway? Jesus.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.760
Jesus.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.640
I'm gonna get roped in.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.440
No, you're not. You're gonna be
in the backyard, growing with us.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.820
I know how these things work, Ben.

00:07:58.821 --> 00:08:00.200
Oh, do you? How do you know?

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.956
I think you've never
been back to a lady job.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.020
Yeah, I'm careful not to get roped in.

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:06.731
I'm glad I caught you
before you headed back out.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:07.860
She's gonna be okay.

00:08:07.861 --> 00:08:10.060
There's loud room 124.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.240
Who? You're patient.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.320
Little boy wanted to say thank you.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.940
You know what?
Mr. Ben Perker here did all the work, so...

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.020
Just take it.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.640
Take it.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.220
Take it.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:30.660
Thanks, buddy.

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:33.800
I'm taking a receiver.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:35.650
Are you all immediately on me?

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.200
I'm her stepdaughter.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.040
I think she might prefer...

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:41.550
Yeah, it's okay, Dad.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.020
I'll see you guys back at your apartment.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.440
Okay. Come on, buddy.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:48.380
This is mine.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:49.100
Okay.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:50.780
This one is for you.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:52.980
Thanks so much.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.540
What am I supposed to do with this?

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.960
Just put it in your pocket and
then throw it away somewhere else.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.610
You can't even fold it.
It's like cardboard.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.320
Oh, come on.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.520
We both hate family stuff.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.440
I think I have plans, anyway, so...

00:09:16.441 --> 00:09:19.520
Plans? Since when you have plans,
you're, like, impossible to pin down.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.900
Well, I like to keep my
options open, you know?

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.740
I might sleep in. I might go to the museum.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.880
I might walk the dock.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:25.940
You don't have a dog?

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.180
I might adopt one.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:28.680
Return the neighbor.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.000
I suspect you were a bit
more of an ample bucking.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.860
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:35.460
I was a model foster kid.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.140
A p-i and everything.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.560
So, I, um...

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.680
kind of met someone.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:46.460
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.060
What's this one saying?

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.800
Oh.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.800
Serious.

00:09:56.824 --> 00:10:06.824
<b><font color="#60ff00">Subtitle made by Master_Blaster for https://subscene.com/</font></b>

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.540
Ooh!

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.680
Yeah!

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:34.490
She's a lucky lady, then.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:37.590
Thank you.

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:38.870
Oh.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:43.510
You have a winning personality,
I guess I got yours by mistake.

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:45.530
You're an asshole.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:46.850
Here.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:49.990
Let's see what your future holds for you.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.600
What if I don't want to know?

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:54.790
Well, it's just a cookie.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:01.470
You will.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:03.110
You will what?

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.090
Apparently I have no future.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.630
Cassie, do you know what this means?

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:09.830
What?

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.410
It means that their printer is broken.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:14.670
We can't eat here anymore.

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.110
I just need to make up this pizza.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.456
Why don't you come in and talk to me, Dad?

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.680
I haven't seen you in a while.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.080
This is not home right now, actually.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:41.960
I'm coming back to work.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.640
I swear.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.840
Why? All right.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.920
Us strange things stick together.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.560
Somebody's hungry.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.800
I hope the spiders weren't worth it, Mom.

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:08.990
We ate three people, four people.

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:09.750
What now, Mom?

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:11.170
What now?

00:14:11.171 --> 00:14:12.570
What now?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.280
Three, two, one.

00:14:17.281 --> 00:14:22.100
Can you tell me
your name? Robert.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:24.260
Robert? I'm Cassie.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.140
What?

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.520
I'm gonna help you out, okay?

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.180
You're gonna be all right.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.540
All right, I'm gonna cut your seatbelt,
and when I do, you're gonna fall,

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.860
and my partner's gonna help
you out on that side, okay?

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.580
Three, two, one.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.180
All right, Robert.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.300
One, two, three.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.320
Why? Aywork.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:21.880
You're going to tell me your name.

00:15:21.881 --> 00:15:22.881
Mm-hmm.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.260
Do you guys need ice cold?

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.180
I'm gonna take the ice cold.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.400
Eee-huh.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:33.000
No need to press.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.140
No need to press.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.580
No need to press.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.000
You can't say your name right now.

00:15:40.001 --> 00:15:40.660
Yes, I can't, I can't say
your name right now.

00:15:40.661 --> 00:15:40.980
I'm gonna take the ice cold.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.028
to be in more than one
place at the same time as

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.860
you are the only one
who can change the future.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:48.720
NOOOOOOO!

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.420
It's a crazy dream!

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:51.860
Come on! I'm tired.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.060
I'm nervous.

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:58.660
Did I die?

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:02.240
Yeah, you were down three
minutes before I fished you out.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:03.760
Three minutes? Yeah.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.700
Welcome back to the land of the living.

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:25.670
79 over 55, you need a real workout
at a real hospital with a real doctor.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:26.930
I don't need a doctor.

00:16:27.935 --> 00:16:28.935
I trust you.

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:31.430
80%! That's great.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:34.070
Why are we above
that of a dead fish?

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:36.750
Huh?

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.750
No, 2's going up to 89.

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:43.470
Come back in the water any time.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:57.130
79 over 55, you need a real workout
at a real hospital with a real doctor.

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:00.890
Seriously, Ben, dial it back. I'm fine.

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.500
Wait, wait, wait.
I need to get your oxygen onwards.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:05.610
Again?

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:07.590
What are you talking
about? My O2 is 89.

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:08.850
No, it's not.

00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:13.470
..

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:15.510
Oh, you're right.

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.230
Are you okay? What the
hell happened out there? Fine.

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:25.990
I just want to go home and watch Idol.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:34.920
No, no, no, no.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:23.390
Where's my spider?

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:24.910
Where's my spider?

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:21.450
It's not a dream.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.150
I'm going to be murdered one day.

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:27.210
Oh, wow, that's a buzzkill.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:32.630
The same three faces.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.830
Every night, the same vision.

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:38.850
It's a curse.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:40.930
But we all die someday.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.230
I think we really didn't stop that.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:48.690
If you still always go on to
murder you, you try to stop them.

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:51.230
Okay.

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:58.350
You have no idea of the torment and
torture of dying over and over again.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:20:59.830
And I can't escape it.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.960
So I'm not going to sit
back and let it happen.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:08.670
I will find them and kill them first.

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:15.750
So you know who did... I mean, will do it?

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:19.670
It's always those three faces.

00:21:19.671 --> 00:21:23.984
Can you imagine how
frustrating it's been trying

00:21:23.996 --> 00:21:28.230
to identify someone
I've only seen in a vision?

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:35.570
But as the universe has, there
have been technological advances.

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:39.390
New ways to find people
if you know their faces.

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:46.510
The kind of technology I've heard the
National Security Agency has been pursuing.

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:05.700
What are you doing?

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:07.440
How are you questioning me?

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.120
What's your password, ma'am?

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.360
I can't tell you.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:14.520
Please! Yes, please,
your password.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:20.440
Tell me quickly before the paralysis
reaches your lips, and I'll stop the poison.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:38.260
Q-9-2-0-B-3-7-5

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:53.670
It's a good thing I had no idea today
was the day we were going to die.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:15.790
Hey!

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:20.870
Hey, next time you want to go swimming,
maybe you should stick to a story apart.

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:23.190
Oh, that's really funny.
You're such a funny guy.

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:25.190
Are you crafting the burgers?

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:26.850
I'm releasing them back.

00:23:27.435 --> 00:23:30.035
That's called play here, ma'am.
Plus, it's like really clam-able.

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:30.730
There you go.

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:31.970
Oh, thanks.

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:35.350
You don't think that maybe in light
of recent events I could use a beer?

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:41.210
Well, as you know, the protocol is no
booze within 24 hours of your death.

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:42.710
Is that protocol?

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:44.070
Yeah, it's a protocol.

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:45.050
That's boring.

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:47.090
I feel like there's more of a story there.

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:50.790
No, you guys, we've seen this a
hundred times. It was cardiac arrest.

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:53.310
When your heart starts
back up again, you're fine.

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:55.490
Really?

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:59.570
Yeah, huh?
Did you see the white light or what?

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:07.010
Well, actually, I saw Jersey, so you
tell me... Oh, come on. You saw Jersey.

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:07.730
Hey.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:09.030
What did Jersey do?

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:11.190
They were rushing the burgers.

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:12.610
Yeah, they're ruined now.

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:14.110
You saw them?

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:15.980
Oh, now they're really ruined.

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:17.870
Ready to start.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:18.910
What?

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:19.690
What?

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:21.710
They're starting to
see if you get in there.

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:23.990
No, you were right. They're roping in.

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:24.950
Yeah, thank you so much.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:26.170
You're welcome.

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:27.310
Have fun.

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:35.050
This is for you.

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:36.150
This is for you.

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:42.950
Hi, I'm Cassie Webb. Thanks for having me.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.370
You're Ben's partner.
I'm his sister-in-law.

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.930
Yeah.

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:47.490
Nice to meet you.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.950
Ben is so excited about being an uncle.

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:52.256
I don't know what we'd do without him.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.440
Especially with Richard away.

00:24:53.775 --> 00:24:55.710
Again, where is it this time?

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:59.710
He's in Mumbai, Shanghai.
I can't keep track.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:06.670
Never stops leaping around
in there and always hungry.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.050
Does it have a name?

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:13.620
We're saving that for the games.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:28.420
My mother always cut the
crusts off my sandwiches.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:31.480
Chloe, is that you?

00:25:31.481 --> 00:25:32.481
Yes.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.420
My mom said the crust
would make my hair feel curly.

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:39.770
It was yours before I figured that one out.

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:46.410
This is this.

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:49.870
Oh, it's mine.

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:53.270
You must have at least one
thought memory of your mother.

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:57.410
Well, my mother
actually died in childbirth.

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:00.810
But it wasn't that bad.

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:05.010
Obviously, it was that. She died.

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:10.150
But I grew up totally healthy.

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:13.010
Death in childbirth is super rare.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:19.030
She chose to be way deeper than
Amazon for the last month of her pregnancy,

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:22.020
hundreds of miles away
from any medical facilities.

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:25.870
Okay, so let's move on to the next one.

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:29.410
Guess the name of Mary's baby.

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:33.190
Okay, I'll kick things off.

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:36.410
Stephen.

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:39.270
He's not named Stephen.

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:41.250
You guys are ice cold.

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:48.810
Richard Jr.

00:26:48.811 --> 00:26:49.811
? Richard wishes.

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:54.490
Cassie, what's your guess?

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.330
Wait, we just did this.

00:27:18.331 --> 00:27:22.070
What's your guess?

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:26.870
Wait, we just did this.

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:34.390
What, seriously, is this part of the game?

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:39.510
Sorry, they're calling everyone
in and fighting down into dogs.

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:43.610
So...

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:44.830
You okay?

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:48.410
Yeah, I just got a weird sense of deja vu.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.170
Looks like a practically
left radius under my stable.

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:09.780
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:10.900
Check this out.

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:13.760
Oh, it's okay.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.340
We had the internal injuries.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.680
Good catch.

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:24.520
Hey, I need to get my gun out of there.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.220
Stay where people are trapped.

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.300
We need to treat them before we move them.

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.940
He's packed with explosives.

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:32.880
Engestion will bring fireworks.

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:35.060
Ignore them!

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:39.560
Ignore them!

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:41.680
Cassie!

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:45.020
Cassie!

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:51.720
This place is always
going to be a dead trap.

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:55.860
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.040
Check this out.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.540
Cassie! Cassie! Cassie!

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:18.740
I need you at the triad!

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.560
Sir, you're okay. You're okay.

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:24.400
He's stable, ready to transport.

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:27.180
Is everything okay?

00:29:27.181 --> 00:29:28.860
What's up?

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:30.380
Wait!

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.560
I'm out!

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.400
Hey, what is it? I got a roll.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:34.660
We let you drive?

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:36.140
What are you talking about?

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.040
I don't know, I just...
I don't know what we're feeling.

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:40.680
Cassie, I need you over there.

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:42.500
Will you just let me drive?

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.960
We've got a bad experience on the job.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.760
I don't think that's what's happening.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.200
Don't let it mess with your head.

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:20.430
We don't need you.

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:28.610
We don't need you.

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.240
Cassie! Cassie!

00:30:40.241 --> 00:30:43.600
Hey, Cassie!

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.080
Cassie, come on!

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.280
Cassie! Cassie!

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.600
Come on, come on!

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.600
Come on, Cassie!

00:30:58.880 --> 00:30:59.900
You've got to help me!

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.740
It's okay, okay?

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:08.040
Just have a little time, okay?

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:46.760
So, was it worth the trouble?

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.520
The scale of the NSA's
surveillance is unprecedented.

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:51.380
They can access everything.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.360
There's... there's nowhere to hide.

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:55.420
That's the idea.

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:57.720
The potential is infinite.

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:00.720
It's... it's intoxicating, but...

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.720
in the wrong hands, I mean...

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.180
people can be tracked wherever they go.

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:07.660
It's going to change everything.

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.720
As long as it has the ability
to find those women now,

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.420
before they get their powers.

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.760
This is what they look
like in your visions,

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.080
as well as you can recollect.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.220
Their faces have been
daunting me for years.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.760
We don't know exactly
when your vision takes place,

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:26.120
so I'm giving this a 10-year
range just to be safe.

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.460
Here's what they should look like now.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:38.860
If you're good, then I thought I'd... I
didn't know we'd be targeting teenagers.

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.420
They're teenagers now, but in the future,

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:44.420
they have powers, and
they will try to destroy me.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.640
I came from nothing, less than nothing.

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:49.300
I will not give up everything I've built,

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:50.780
and have my life cut short.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:58.600
I'll say, ride public transportation, go to
the museum, get money from an ATM,

00:32:59.665 --> 00:33:00.905
wherever they are in the world.

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:03.340
Fine, then.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:04.960
I'd pay you a fortune.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:06.920
Yeah, fine.

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:12.700
Still no blurriness, no division,

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:14.760
no discoloration at all.

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:17.540
Your eyesight is good,

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.400
and all your other vitals check out.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.880
But what about the visions?

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:25.880
How long have I seen that stuff?

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.640
Sometimes, when we experience trauma,

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.120
it can have a lasting effect.

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:31.420
This isn't trauma.

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:33.520
I knew he was gonna die.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:35.980
I saw it.

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:39.281
Cassie, I have all your reports
here from your other consultations.

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:42.680
Your head CT was
normal, your MRI was clear.

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:44.800
The scan showed no abnormality.

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:46.160
I know that it sounds crazy.

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.340
I know, but I don't
understand what's happening.

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:50.700
I will be recommending
that you take a week off.

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:51.940
Get some rest.

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.000
Watch old movies.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.960
If you still have concerns,

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:56.980
I can run some bloods over for you to take.

00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:01.000
But I'm sure everything will be
back to normal before you know it.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.600
I have been to prison service.

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.040
Prison's yet to come.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:18.021
If you have a feeling you
won't let anyone take that.

00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:23.410
I can never see anyone.

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:31.091
Hey Cassie, it's me again.

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:32.810
Ben.

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:34.530
You're there to speak up.

00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:38.490
Okay, well, uh...

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:40.230
O'Neill's funeral starts at two.

00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:41.991
I can see everyone's gone.

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:45.090
I know, it's the last place you want to be.

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:47.030
But it would help Susan.

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:49.530
The king might help you too.

00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:52.981
But if you leave now,
you can still be good.

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:54.710
Cassie?

00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:56.130
Cass?

00:34:56.131 --> 00:34:57.131
Yes.

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:15.370
Ain't afraid to be screwed, but...

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:18.030
you can't change anything.

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.120
This isn't going to change anything.

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:34.270
It's the entire world.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.960
I'm going to the cancer, please.

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.080
On your course, I start
moving onto the platform.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.800
She's on her own.

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:47.600
Julia Cornwall is on the
concourse, also alone.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.400
And Martha Franklin.

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:56.300
Shit!

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.280
What are the odds of them all being
in the same place at the same time?

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:00.440
It's not a coincidence.

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.120
There must be something that connects them.

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:06.720
Or... something that will.

00:38:06.721 --> 00:38:10.060
Please keep all coming to you at all times.

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:13.960
Please do see something suspicious
by the member of the MTA staff.

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.420
You don't see the whole
new level of craziness.

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:43.260
Fire!

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.840
This is the train to Mount Parker.

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:23.020
Is this real?

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:25.560
Are you okay too?

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:28.000
Oh god, I'm in the park.

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.700
You don't see the whole new
level of craziness these days.

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:41.780
This is the train to Mount Parker.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.600
This is the train to Mount Parker.

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:26.360
Get up. Get up. Get up.

00:41:26.361 --> 00:41:26.740
Get up.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:27.300
Beep.

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.180
Get up.

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.680
You're gonna die if you stay here.

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:29.900
Get up.

00:41:29.901 --> 00:41:31.400
What? Are you where it is?

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:35.000
This is an emergency situation.
I need you to follow my instructions.

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:36.260
Get off the train.

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:36.740
Come on.

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:37.700
I'll just let you know.

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:38.340
I'll just let you know.

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:39.300
Get up.

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:40.640
Hey, give me that back.

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.380
I'm so pressing charges.

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.320
Okay, knock yourself out.

00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:51.420
Give me my person to stay for that.

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:08.340
What's up? Okay, come on.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.180
I'm getting my freaking skateboard back.

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:18.580
Okay.

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.440
What exactly is this emergency?

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:21.020
What?

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:22.380
Someone's trying to deduct us.

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.400
What? No.

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:24.780
Shit.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:28.680
Back to your emergency.

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:49.970
Yeah!

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:25.150
The FDC is placing the luggage rack above.

00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:55.090
Hey.

00:43:55.091 --> 00:43:56.091
Holy shit.

00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:57.210
Come on.

00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:18.670
No.

00:44:18.671 --> 00:44:19.751
There's an emergency, guys.

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:24.040
What's going on
here? I don't know.

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:25.260
We'll have you some coffee.

00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:26.536
You guys need to call from back.

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:27.360
That will not be necessary.

00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:28.160
I told you to call.

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:29.040
Hey, let's go.

00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:29.940
Don't leave us.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:30.340
Shit.

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:32.000
We'll be in the car.

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:32.940
We'll be in the car.

00:44:32.941 --> 00:44:33.941
Go.

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:37.750
Go.

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:44.870
Go, go, go.

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:46.190
Go, go, go, go.

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:08.160
Shit.

00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:16.230
Shit.

00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:16.410
Get in.

00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:23.100
Get in.

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:28.700
It's not even possible.

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:29.500
It's not.

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.636
There's not enough friction on
course and the bear came and

00:45:31.648 --> 00:45:33.636
flipped to overcome gravity
and keep him stuck to the wall.

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:34.500
It's not like sailing.

00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:06.130
What is it?

00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:09.310
I'm Anya Corazón.

00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:11.330
Madi Franklin.

00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:12.890
Thank you for protecting us.

00:46:12.891 --> 00:46:15.670
No, no, no.
That's not what's happening here.

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:18.130
I'm not protecting you. I am...

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:21.150
Your parents can handle this.

00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:22.666
Your parents are on a business trip.

00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:24.270
Yeah, my parents are out of town, too.

00:46:24.370 --> 00:46:26.670
Oh, my daughter's busy working, so...

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:28.346
Oh, it's going to go
stay with some friends.

00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:30.730
Well, where are your friends live?
I'll drop you off first.

00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:38.530
That's great. Good.

00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:40.910
Hope they find you crazy ass.

00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:44.530
That was insane. They better lock them up.

00:46:48.310 --> 00:46:49.310
She?

00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:54.870
What? What? That's.

00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:58.110
..

00:46:58.111 --> 00:47:00.010
Look, you guys...
What about them?

00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:01.450
He was crawling on the ceiling.

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:02.270
What about that guy?

00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:03.450
I mean, you saw...

00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:04.830
No one saw a ceiling guy.

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:06.370
Everyone thinks Julie could not hurt.

00:47:06.371 --> 00:47:08.150
Yeah, because you told them I was.

00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:09.530
I didn't know what was happening.

00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:10.770
Okay, guys.

00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:13.506
My Uncle John can totally help us.
I'm going to call him.

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:14.530
You're moving phone?

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:16.470
You know they can track
those nowadays, right?

00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:19.510
Hey, you can't do that.

00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:20.110
She's right.

00:47:20.350 --> 00:47:21.746
It's okay. Daddy, I thought you knew it.

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:22.770
What is your problem?

00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:23.530
What are you doing?

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:24.670
I'm just trying to help.

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:28.090
Okay, anyone who wants
to leave can leave right now.

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:29.270
Okay.

00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:30.590
Wait.

00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:36.270
Sorry, no, you can't actually
leave because you guys

00:47:36.271 --> 00:47:37.271
are the only ones that know
what actually happened.

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:43.320
Okay, well, this is what
we're going to do, okay?

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:45.660
We're just going to,
like, lay low for a little bit.

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:50.381
And, um... I'll figure
out how to get out of this.

00:47:57.090 --> 00:47:59.370
This is still not a kidnapping, okay?

00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:02.230
Feels like a kidnapping.

00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:06.420
How did they get away?

00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:08.400
It's like the rumor was coming.

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:12.660
No, it's the transportation in
West Duval or any of the bridges.

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.400
Okay, there weren't there any cameras.

00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:17.100
The police don't have this technology.

00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:19.860
You have access to
every camera in the city.

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.040
We should be ahead of them.

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:25.080
I went to a lot of trouble
to steal you these tools.

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:26.760
You stole them back.

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:29.540
Have I just wanted to be a fresco?

00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.080
Of course you did.

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:33.040
And maybe I'll start it.

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:34.940
All I have is gum.

00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:38.860
Here, I found this in
the glove compartment.

00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:41.836
Wait, not that. I've already been open.

00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:43.336
We don't know how long it's been in there.

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:45.860
Okay, I hope you're good
at, um, catching squirrels.

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:49.600
Okay, so, what's the
deal with stealing guys?

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:51.020
I told you, I don't know.

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:52.640
I've never seen him before.

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:54.320
How did you know he was coming?

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:57.660
I'm kind of more interested
in why he's trying to kill us.

00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:59.420
I don't know.

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:02.540
Crazy shit's been happening
and I don't know why.

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:04.220
Stop asking me, okay?

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.460
Wait, you're the paramedic.

00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:11.520
You saved my stepmother then
you were super awkward about it.

00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:15.700
That does sound like me.

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:17.820
Wait, I recognize you too.

00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:19.400
What?

00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:21.040
Yeah, you live in my building.

00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:24.606
You leave your junk
mail in the lobby and then

00:49:24.618 --> 00:49:26.580
everybody else has
to clean it up for you.

00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:29.020
Okay, well, there should
be a recycling bin there.

00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:30.620
You don't think this is weird?

00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:33.080
That we both know you?

00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:36.460
It's honestly, like, the least
weird thing that's happened all day.

00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:40.950
What? Total stranger.

00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:46.710
No.

00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:49.210
You flipped me off.

00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:51.330
It's not really really down much.

00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:52.590
Here, this is so freaky.

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:55.230
Who are you? What is going on?

00:49:57.780 --> 00:49:59.250
I can see the future.

00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:02.270
Kind of.

00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:10.210
I didn't.

00:50:10.211 --> 00:50:12.130
Oh, what the hell? See?

00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:13.830
You shouldn't see that coming.

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:15.850
It doesn't work like that.

00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:17.810
You guys, just give her a chance, please.

00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:21.233
Wait, when you were
looking into the future,

00:50:21.245 --> 00:50:23.550
did you see us in the
middle of nowhere,

00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:27.850
eating love compartment or... Okay,
look, believe me or don't, I don't care.

00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:30.384
I didn't ask to be
doing this with you and I

00:50:30.396 --> 00:50:32.650
didn't ask for this to
happen to me either.

00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:35.950
Also, I'm pretty sure I've
saved all of your lives.

00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:38.350
So, you're welcome.

00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:42.240
How does it work?

00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:45.790
It just happens.

00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:47.430
Can you do it now?

00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:50.490
I can't control it.

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:53.490
You know the other guy can walk
on the ceiling, right? No, he can't.

00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:57.930
He was using his hands.

00:50:58.970 --> 00:50:59.970
Why are you like this?

00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:02.490
I'm just saying it was more of a crawl.

00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:06.430
It was like a spider... person.

00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:18.260
I'm gonna be back in a few hours.

00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:21.200
Where are you going?

00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:24.800
I need to check some
things out about all of this.

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:27.260
You can't just leave us here.

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:29.660
We'll be okay, Julia, we
don't need a babysitter.

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:31.940
Oh, yeah, sure, just three
teenagers alone in the

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.740
woods, definitely not
the opening of a war film.

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:35.580
You are way safer out here.

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:40.560
Just, you know, be like a Girl Scout girl.

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.660
Be back. Just be back.

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.161
Can you bring us some
sandwiches? Pass the ear.

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:49.560
Can we toast here?

00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:52.880
Three hours, okay?
Just stay here.

00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:56.020
Don't do anything dumb.

00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:03.840
Seriously, don't do dumb things.

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:08.320
She was stalking you.

00:52:08.890 --> 00:52:11.580
Okay, well, you're just a bitch, so...

00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:19.060
I know a second ago.

00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:20.880
You.

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:25.101
I had a few rough years in school
when my parents were divorced,

00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:28.540
so I wanted to feel like
I'd be back if I needed to.

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:35.040
That's what I thought.

00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:48.730
One second, Kat.

00:53:57.350 --> 00:53:59.220
Research on Amazonian spiders.

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:02.080
Peptides.

00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:03.420
More peptides.

00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:05.020
Where is it?

00:54:07.090 --> 00:54:08.300
Ah, spider people.

00:54:09.875 --> 00:54:10.875
Las Aranyas.

00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:13.941
Have you ever heard
of Las Aranyas? Neither.

00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:21.380
According to local folklore,

00:54:23.035 --> 00:54:26.040
they possess powers
derived from spider venom

00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:30.220
and are incredibly fast, incredibly strong,

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:32.630
and...

00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:34.140
they can climb like spiders.

00:54:36.610 --> 00:54:37.840
She's like a singing guy.

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:49.340
How would you know if you could
climb a wall if you've ever tried?

00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:08.850
Okay, let's not mention that as anybody.

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:20.320
Las Aranyas are said
to possess a sixth sense

00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:23.440
as if they have the
ability to climb the future.

00:55:57.310 --> 00:55:58.310
Who's got the
jerky? You ate it all.

00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:01.320
You had like three pieces.

00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:02.560
I was fine.

00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:03.940
You counted.

00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:05.180
You also ate all mine.

00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:08.540
What's this? Okay.

00:56:14.970 --> 00:56:15.370
We got jerky.

00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:17.910
Did you guys see that diner?

00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:19.671
Like a half mile down the road?

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:21.486
Let's just go there and get real food.

00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:22.750
How's it supposed to
stay here? Come on, Julia.

00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:25.030
She bailed on us.

00:56:25.410 --> 00:56:26.870
We don't have any money, Junius.

00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:28.250
Well, I have money.

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.601
You have money so we
should do what you want?

00:56:32.010 --> 00:56:33.010
You got something to say?

00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:34.850
You know, I bet.

00:56:35.330 --> 00:56:36.330
Your dad is a senator,

00:56:36.655 --> 00:56:38.266
and your mom sits on the board at the Met,

00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:40.571
and you somewhere in the
Hamptons next to Martha Stewart.

00:56:40.610 --> 00:56:41.910
So sad about Martha Stewart.

00:56:45.705 --> 00:56:46.830
My parents are in Beijing,

00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:50.286
where my dad is raking in a tunnel and you're
making plastics that pollute the ocean,

00:56:50.310 --> 00:56:52.110
and my mom is spending
it all on hideous art.

00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:55.201
So I talked to them on Mondays.

00:56:55.530 --> 00:56:56.530
So who do you live with?

00:56:57.290 --> 00:56:58.290
The housekeeper.

00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:01.670
Well, on the upside note, curfew.

00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:04.601
I bet you have your own room at least.

00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:08.330
I live with my dad and
his wife and their kid.

00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:10.030
What about your mom?

00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:12.950
She's not really around.

00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:14.670
She got money? Right, so.

00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:17.590
..

00:57:17.591 --> 00:57:18.591
Diner?

00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:21.311
Please spend some money
saying it's pollution money.

00:57:22.070 --> 00:57:23.991
I'm going to order
everything I'm going to need.

00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:27.750
Julia, you in?

00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:30.510
Hey.

00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:32.501
We have to take care of ourselves.

00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:40.780
Yeah.

00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:44.360
You're right.

00:57:46.110 --> 00:57:47.110
Let's go do this.

00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:50.600
She's kind of cute when she's mad.

00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:55.500
We weren't making
the right decision, Julia.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.360
We would not like women of hatred.

00:57:58.310 --> 00:57:59.460
Who decides we like you now?

00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:01.140
Why?

00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:03.060
I knew we should have done this.

00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:09.520
Do you think there's ticks?

00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:13.520
Julia walks a little bit faster.

00:58:14.610 --> 00:58:15.771
You said this was a shortcut.

00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:17.060
Are you lost?

00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:18.700
I don't know where you're going.

00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:19.880
You're no where you're at.

00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:20.960
Actually, I do.

00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:24.160
Ow!

00:58:24.620 --> 00:58:30.800
Okay, don't talk to anybody except a woman.

00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:32.180
We're going to be nowhere.

00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:33.640
Don't try to track us down here.

00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:35.280
Don't make eye contact.

00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:37.021
Oh, I don't have a chance.

00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:42.320
She'll walk a little bit
faster than the other woman.

00:58:48.450 --> 00:58:49.450
So there you go.

00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:02.460
Should we begin?

00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:03.780
Eat fruits?

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.000
Start a choice later.

00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:07.200
Tell me.

00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:16.740
Let's just eat quickly
and then get up here.

00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:19.920
Absolutely bread and
dough, right after cherry pie.

00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:21.420
Yeah, I know.

00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:23.140
No cherry pie.

00:59:25.850 --> 00:59:27.931
Julia, tell me you agree
that we should get dessert.

00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:33.820
Yeah, whatever you guys are under
another sugar, I'll pay for the good price.

00:59:43.590 --> 00:59:45.340
We should go ahead and talk to them.

00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:46.880
Really?

00:59:47.830 --> 00:59:48.920
No, we should be kidding.

00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:50.060
Should we? Maybe we can't.

00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:52.980
Yeah, you want to.

00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:54.280
I know.

00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:56.460
This is a good idea.

00:59:56.780 --> 00:59:57.140
It's a good idea.

00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:58.140
Yeah, what are you doing?

00:59:58.540 --> 00:59:59.360
Hold on a second.

00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:00.480
Where's this?

01:00:04.435 --> 01:00:06.300
This isn't really my style.

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.500
Come on.

01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:09.300
You're cute.

01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:11.040
This is not a good idea.

01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:12.540
Jason, guys.

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:14.100
Hi.

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:15.420
Hey, how are you doing?

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:16.800
How are you doing? Thanks a lot.

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:18.960
Yeah, I'm doing great.

01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:19.660
Thanks a lot.

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:21.140
Thank you.

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:22.800
Okay.

01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:32.590
Patch Hill City in Churchill, New Jersey.

01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:34.710
Connect me with Churchill Police Dispatch.

01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:35.650
Yeah.

01:00:35.830 --> 01:00:37.130
Patch, are you in now?

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:46.660
Two-two-three dispatch.

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:48.880
On scene of four-star-niner.

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:50.840
Route 206 of Dave's Road.

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:51.920
You're in two-two-three.

01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:53.320
No need to send back.

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:57.240
These aren't our missing persons.

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:00.160
Go forward.

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:02.920
These are not our missing persons.

01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:07.940
No.

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.080
Girls?

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:49.360
Girls?

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:06.580
So much more attractive attention.

01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:24.100
I won't even know that.

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:25.940
We have to get off this.

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:30.020
I'm so sorry.

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:34.080
Get down.

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:36.760
This isn't what we were thinking.

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:37.060
Stop.

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:38.240
You'll laugh at us.

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:40.340
I'm so sorry.

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:45.480
Julia!

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:47.660
Julia, get back!

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.460
Julia, get back!

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:51.680
Stop!

01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:52.940
Stop!

01:02:58.600 --> 01:02:59.740
Come on!

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:00.960
No!

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:02.120
No!

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:04.440
No!

01:03:07.850 --> 01:03:08.850
No!

01:03:09.110 --> 01:03:09.130
No!

01:03:09.131 --> 01:03:10.131
No!

01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:12.210
Come on!

01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:16.250
No!

01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:18.310
No!

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:21.830
No!

01:03:49.615 --> 01:03:51.056
This track is going to be confusing.

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:52.220
Have you heard the song?

01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:53.340
This is with you, bitch.

01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:57.780
Let's try that again.

01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:10.880
I love this song.

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.160
Nice.

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:16.920
Okay, okay, sorry.

01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:24.180
This is funny.

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:26.300
Try it.

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:27.440
Okay.

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:53.640
Come on.

01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:54.260
Let's go.

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:55.940
We were pretending to hold a brick.

01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:57.560
I know you were working hard.

01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:58.720
Get up here.

01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:02.620
Come on.

01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:18.940
Come on.

01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:27.260
Leave everything.

01:05:32.550 --> 01:05:36.530
I'm so sorry.

01:05:51.350 --> 01:05:52.350
No.

01:05:56.180 --> 01:06:00.680
So much for not meeting a bathing spot.

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.580
You guys think of anybody but yourselves.

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:05.360
You're so impulsive and entitled.

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:06.240
And you don't listen.

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:06.980
We didn't even see.

01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:08.760
Whatever, don't even say anything.

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:14.300
God, you're futures
were almost so different.

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:17.860
You're lucky I saw them.

01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:18.940
I'm so sorry.

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:20.360
Yes!

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:23.940
You should be so sorry.
All of you should be sorry.

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:53.100
I'm sorry.

01:06:53.101 --> 01:06:54.101
I'm running checks now.

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.280
I don't understand how they're doing this.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:59.240
I've got a mountain
over and he's with them.

01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:00.620
I'm not interested in her.

01:07:00.621 --> 01:07:02.960
It's about the zone finding those girls.

01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:07.020
Cassandra Webb, daughter
of Constance Webb deceased.

01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:08.860
Did you say Webb? Uh, yeah.

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.520
Do you know her?

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:12.960
It's not possible.

01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:16.660
Mom!

01:07:21.110 --> 01:07:23.031
He's not gonna stop.
Please, he'll just be busy.

01:07:24.330 --> 01:07:25.550
I don't know what he wants.

01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:27.250
I don't know what I need to say.

01:07:29.130 --> 01:07:30.770
But you can see the future.

01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:33.710
Can't you stop him with your visions?

01:07:34.530 --> 01:07:36.110
I don't know how to control them.

01:07:37.210 --> 01:07:38.210
It's useless.

01:07:38.510 --> 01:07:40.030
I don't know why, maybe that's a plus.

01:07:40.590 --> 01:07:41.590
Is your hand okay? It's fine.

01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:51.261
First thing in the morning
I'm taking you all home.

01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:53.020
My parents can deal with this.

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:55.540
No, they can't.

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:00.460
My mom's in a psych ward.

01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:04.666
She didn't really cope
well after my dad left,

01:08:04.690 --> 01:08:07.300
and so I got sent to live
with him and his new family,

01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:09.140
and I don't think that they want me there.

01:08:12.610 --> 01:08:14.200
I wondered if they missed me if...

01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:16.780
if I ran away.

01:08:18.150 --> 01:08:19.400
Hmm. That's what you did.

01:08:20.590 --> 01:08:21.871
My parents aren't around either.

01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:24.941
I think they resent how having
a kid messed up their lives.

01:08:25.750 --> 01:08:28.166
I don't think they're gonna fly
back from China to deal with this,

01:08:28.190 --> 01:08:31.821
and I really don't want to find
out, so... they're on my own.

01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:38.701
Well, fine then. You guys
can just... Go to the police.

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:39.800
No.

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:45.320
My dad got deported six months ago.

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:48.440
I came home from school when he was gone.

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:50.200
What about your mom?

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:51.501
My mom died when I was five.

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:53.960
It's just me and my dad.

01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:56.646
Except he never told me
he didn't have his papers,

01:08:56.670 --> 01:08:59.700
so I've just been living by
myself in our apartment since then.

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.080
You're on your own? I don't.

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:04.580
I don't need anyone
else to look out for me.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.041
And I don't have a girlfriend either.

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:12.760
So I can't go to the police.

01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:15.360
Okay? Until I'm 18.

01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:17.180
I can't exist.

01:09:18.430 --> 01:09:20.231
And there's no way I'm
getting deported, too.

01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:22.060
Or going into the foster system.

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:30.100
Well... the foster system
isn't always that terrible.

01:09:33.750 --> 01:09:35.520
Things didn't turn out so bad for me.

01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:37.420
Right.

01:09:40.790 --> 01:09:43.270
Cassie, please help us.

01:11:59.930 --> 01:12:03.430
No one survives once enough
doors and enters their system.

01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:05.530
You won't be so lucky next time.

01:12:06.630 --> 01:12:07.710
But why are you doing this?

01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:10.130
I need to solve the problem.

01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:12.690
They're not killers.

01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:14.130
They're just teenagers.

01:12:14.410 --> 01:12:16.530
In the future, I have done much more.

01:12:16.670 --> 01:12:19.250
In the future, they will destroy me.

01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:20.550
And everything I've built.

01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:23.630
Those girls cannot exist.

01:12:24.850 --> 01:12:26.110
How are you going to decide?

01:12:26.830 --> 01:12:28.370
Because I'm the one with the powers.

01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:35.830
If you knew where I'd go,
you'd do the same thing.

01:12:37.570 --> 01:12:41.910
Well, I knew the price to
pay was the lives of three girls.

01:12:41.911 --> 01:12:44.650
My young woman and I have
been almost done in the future.

01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:45.910
They also have powers.

01:12:47.810 --> 01:12:48.810
The girls?

01:12:49.190 --> 01:12:51.250
The girls have the powers in the future.

01:12:51.570 --> 01:12:54.650
Because if you can beat me
with your mind, you can beat me.

01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:56.370
Your mother underestimated me.

01:12:56.371 --> 01:12:57.850
Mother underestimated me.

01:12:58.030 --> 01:12:59.530
You made me the power of the star.

01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:02.250
Don't make me say the same thing.

01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:04.250
Tell me where they are.

01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:06.110
They don't mean it effectively.

01:13:07.170 --> 01:13:08.170
You never do.

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:30.200
You never do.

01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:17.100
Okay, so this guy's hands
somehow release an acute neurotoxin.

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:18.560
And it is painful.

01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:23.180
I was lucky. The longer he holds onto
you, the more poison gets into your system.

01:14:23.530 --> 01:14:24.530
Then what happens?

01:14:25.770 --> 01:14:26.920
Then your heart stops.

01:14:28.650 --> 01:14:31.440
But you can offset cardiac arrest with CPR.

01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:35.260
So, you interlock your hands like this.

01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:37.060
You lock your elbows.

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:41.140
And then you place the heel of
your hand right on the sternum.

01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:43.220
And then you pump.

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.440
And you want to go like two inches down.

01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:47.941
And you want to keep a
rhythm like a heartbeat.

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:50.000
You ready?

01:14:50.001 --> 01:14:52.920
Okay, begin compressions. Go. Good.

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:55.920
And when do I
stop? You don't stop.

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:57.960
If you stop, they die.

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:01.560
If you get tired, then you
need somebody to take over.

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:03.560
I'm tired.

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:05.620
Okay, Anya, get ready to take over.

01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:08.280
But you have to pick up
the exact same rhythm.

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:09.800
Ready? Yeah.

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:10.220
And go.

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:11.640
Great.

01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:16.860
Yes, Matty?

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:21.720
Julie, you want to
take over? Okay.

01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:22.940
Get ready.

01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:24.580
Okay.

01:15:26.710 --> 01:15:28.360
One, two, three.

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:30.840
Nice job, Anya.

01:15:33.610 --> 01:15:37.540
I've never said this before in my
entire life, but you're a good teacher.

01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:43.440
Well, I've been learning some
things, too, about my mom.

01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:55.340
Wait, so you do know this guy?

01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:58.140
My mom did, I think. That's her.

01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:00.100
She's really pretty.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:05.810
So this is because of you?

01:16:08.650 --> 01:16:11.350
All I know is that she
was researching spiders.

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:15.590
In her notebook, there's
some stuff about a local

01:16:15.602 --> 01:16:18.450
tribe in Peru that can
do, like, crazy stuff.

01:16:19.210 --> 01:16:20.610
No kind of crazy stuff.

01:16:22.730 --> 01:16:23.730
Climb like spiders.

01:16:25.950 --> 01:16:28.170
So is he one of them?

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:30.330
I need more information.

01:16:34.530 --> 01:16:35.530
You're leaving.

01:16:39.630 --> 01:16:41.620
I have to go and figure
out what is going on.

01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:43.340
Who?

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:47.320
He has to go to Peru.

01:16:51.070 --> 01:16:52.800
I'll be gone a week.
I don't want to leave them.

01:16:52.801 --> 01:16:55.050
But he's out there looking
for them, and they're relying

01:16:55.062 --> 01:16:57.041
on me, and I don't know
how else to protect them.

01:16:57.490 --> 01:16:59.564
Okay. Look, I'm staying down
there for a few weeks over.

01:16:59.576 --> 01:17:01.620
It's out of town. He
won't find them there.

01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:05.124
But Cassie, I can't
pretend to understand

01:17:05.136 --> 01:17:08.480
what's going on here.
Just be careful, okay?

01:17:09.170 --> 01:17:12.300
I'll be back as soon as I can. Thank
you, Ben. You didn't ask for any of this.

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:13.760
Okay, well neither did you.

01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:04.810
No, no, no, no.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.340
I promised your mother I would be here.

01:19:52.670 --> 01:19:54.930
My mom thought Las Arrannas were a myth.

01:19:55.670 --> 01:19:56.670
What do you think?

01:19:56.710 --> 01:19:58.870
I think she's crazy for coming here alone.

01:19:59.570 --> 01:20:02.270
She came here hoping
to extract killing properties

01:20:02.282 --> 01:20:05.210
from the spiders. She thought
she was being protected.

01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:06.910
Bye, does he feel sense?

01:20:07.170 --> 01:20:10.188
His motives were selfish.
He used your mom to find

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:13.290
us. But because he stole
the spider, he was cursed.

01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:17.130
He's been trying to outrun
his destiny ever since.

01:20:24.210 --> 01:20:25.560
This is where my mom died?

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:27.820
And where you were born?

01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:36.950
I don't understand why she
risked my life to come here.

01:20:37.850 --> 01:20:41.790
To see your future clearly, you
have to heal the wounds of your past.

01:20:42.330 --> 01:20:45.630
That sounds like literally every
therapy session I've ever avoided.

01:20:45.930 --> 01:20:49.410
You have to go back to your
beginning and keep going past that.

01:20:49.411 --> 01:20:53.890
You are powerless.
You don't even know you're capable of it.

01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:56.870
Your threat did not start
when you were born.

01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:01.760
Do you trust me?

01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:06.351
I'm not really sure if
this is my net of choice.

01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:15.940
You need to just walk away.

01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:18.560
Your threat did not start
when you were born.

01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:24.920
She really is trying her best
to keep me from working.

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:27.960
Not when I was close, but when
I'm not going to let her do that.

01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:29.960
Why did you hate
me so much? I care.

01:21:30.380 --> 01:21:31.380
Give it to me.

01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:34.240
I'm sorry.

01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:36.380
I'm sorry.

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:38.100
I'm sorry.

01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:39.640
Give it to me.

01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:42.660
Give it to me.

01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:44.940
Give it to me.

01:21:44.941 --> 01:21:45.320
Give it to me.

01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:46.200
Give it to me.

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:47.780
I'm sorry.

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:01.160
I'm sorry.

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:02.440
I'm sorry.

01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:04.620
I'm sorry.

01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:10.000
That's what I used to cannot stand by.

01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:12.760
Have you tried for the
safety of your world?

01:22:30.110 --> 01:22:34.630
Your journey will not be
easy, but she is strong.

01:22:43.780 --> 01:22:46.040
Your test results came back.

01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:49.340
I'm sorry to tell you that
your mania is my zebra.

01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:52.720
It's a genetic neuro-muscular disorder.

01:22:53.140 --> 01:22:54.760
But I don't have a neuro-muscular disorder.

01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:56.020
Does that accept
disease? It varies.

01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:58.660
Do you need a tissue?

01:22:59.420 --> 01:22:59.720
No.

01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:01.060
No, I need the cure.

01:23:01.061 --> 01:23:03.360
I'm afraid there is no cure.

01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:06.140
A single target nucleotide intervention.

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:10.220
It's experimental, but there are
some promising leads in the Amazon.

01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:11.820
That's why you want that?

01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:13.640
For me?

01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:15.820
I have to advise you against traveling.

01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:16.800
I'm sorry.

01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:19.300
What are you offering besides tissues?

01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:21.260
I know this is hard to accept.

01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:22.340
No, no.

01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:27.240
I'm unwilling to accept a
diagnosis of helplessness.

01:23:27.770 --> 01:23:29.960
And I'm not going to teach
my daughter too either.

01:23:42.230 --> 01:23:43.460
You did it.

01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:46.680
I never knew I was sick.

01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:49.640
The spider venom did
have healing properties.

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:55.000
I'm so sorry I spent so long being mine.

01:24:39.570 --> 01:24:42.130
I was not my mom didn't care about me.

01:24:43.310 --> 01:24:45.890
Sometimes you must sacrifice
yourself for what you love.

01:24:50.305 --> 01:24:51.020
I was there.

01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:52.260
I was in the room.

01:24:53.205 --> 01:24:54.340
I was in the room with her.

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:55.400
How did you do
that? You did that.

01:24:57.420 --> 01:24:59.800
Now you're starting to
see what you're capable of.

01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:02.720
You came here to learn
the truth about your past.

01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:05.900
You will be ready to embrace your future.

01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:10.460
Seeing into the future
is no match for Ezekiel.

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:13.640
I need to stop him
before he kills those girls.

01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:15.460
But I can't do what he can do.

01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:19.560
I can't do the leap egg,
crawly, like death poison.

01:25:19.561 --> 01:25:22.660
You didn't get the gift
of the greater physical

01:25:22.661 --> 01:25:24.840
strength or the ability
to release poison.

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:29.440
But seeing into the
future is only the start.

01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:32.500
Your mind has infinite potential.

01:25:33.150 --> 01:25:34.380
If you master your power,

01:25:35.250 --> 01:25:38.960
you can use the web to be in more
than one place at the same time.

01:25:39.970 --> 01:25:42.940
You are the only one
who can change the future.

01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:50.440
And when you take on the responsibility,
your ability to raise power will come.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:09.280
I put death a bit closer.

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:13.460
And you still have found nothing?

01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:17.120
How can she forget the 32
natures hidden for a week?

01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:19.340
I'm running checks every three minutes,

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:21.120
scanning CCTV camera.

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:23.980
I packed police and
emergency services frequencies.

01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:25.880
I have eyes on all of their houses,

01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:27.660
including friends and family.

01:26:29.915 --> 01:26:30.915
Still nothing.

01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:32.500
Do you understand?

01:26:35.610 --> 01:26:37.060
Those girls cannot exist.

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:39.260
They will try to destroy me,

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:41.700
as I will you if you don't find them.

01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:45.060
She can't hide them forever.

01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:51.900
Okay, it's still pretty quiet out there.

01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:53.320
What did I miss? Ben said words.

01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:54.580
Oh, foreign.

01:26:55.480 --> 01:27:01.900
Okay, let's try and remember to pick up
after ourselves Hey, woah, woah, woah, woah.

01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:07.780
Guys, guys, either I paid
myself or my water broke.

01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:10.860
Ew.

01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:14.320
Well, honestly, you probably paid yourself
because that isn't supposed to happen yet.

01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:18.160
Richard's not here, and the
baby isn't due for four weeks.

01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:20.440
I don't think the baby got the medal, Ben.

01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:21.740
Okay, okay, okay.

01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:27.060
Looks like we may have to wait a
little while for the roll ambulance.

01:27:27.061 --> 01:27:29.400
The baby is not waiting.

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:30.680
He's coming.

01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:32.420
Now, now.

01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:35.240
Uh, like here, in the dining room?

01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:38.300
If Ben doesn't get me
to the hospital, then yes.

01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:42.720
Okay, uh, uh, get in the car.

01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:01.680
Okay, okay, sleep helps everybody.

01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:03.300
Seriously? Let's go.

01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:05.180
Uh, never mind.

01:28:31.690 --> 01:28:33.010
Red house and Ben.

01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:42.500
I've intercepted a call to the hospital.

01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:44.040
Same time it is.

01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:45.100
Track the route.

01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:46.160
Track it.

01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:05.260
Yeah.

01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:26.581
Is this the... Hospital, Ben.

01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:29.160
Get off me, get off me, get off me!

01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:33.120
Shit! Sorry, guys.

01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:45.900
Don't care.

01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:07.228
So the last one was 3 minutes and 24
seconds after the previous one, so that

01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:13.280
means the time between contractions
is increasing at a rate of 21.6 seconds.

01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:15.620
That was pretty fast.

01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:19.340
You better hurry up, I'm not
sticking around if it gets gross.

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:21.840
This is the south last offer in an avenue.

01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:24.280
I'll count them off on the
second avenue intersection.

01:30:25.340 --> 01:30:26.340
Try faster!

01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:27.960
Let's go, let's go, please.

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:30.560
No!

01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:38.540
Back into traffic control.

01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:40.600
Turn the lights green.

01:30:42.780 --> 01:30:43.780
Amaria, now.

01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:45.340
Do not have a lights to green.

01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:50.080
Why is no one stopping you?

01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:52.460
Get out of here!

01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:54.680
You're not stopping me!

01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:56.060
Whoa, whoa!

01:30:56.700 --> 01:30:58.100
Yes, he's pulling the lights out!

01:31:00.260 --> 01:31:01.420
Everyone okay? Yeah.

01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:02.980
Are you okay? Yeah.

01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:11.100
Um... What is that?

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:16.360
Oh my god, that's heaven.

01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:18.460
Guys?

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:32.700
Don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go!

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:07.180
Get out of the way, get the ambulance,
come on, it's not over, come on.

01:32:08.461 --> 01:32:12.440
Ben, I need you to get married
as far away as possible, okay?

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:14.120
As you go, he won't care about you now.

01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:15.640
What about you?

01:32:16.180 --> 01:32:18.240
I'd like to marry when
you need to make plans.

01:32:41.180 --> 01:32:42.180
You're showing off? Yeah.

01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:46.100
Uh, I think we lost him.

01:32:51.380 --> 01:32:51.820
Okay.

01:32:51.821 --> 01:32:53.301
Get in the back and charge that easy.

01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:55.380
I want you to do it though.

01:32:57.560 --> 01:32:59.020
Okay, press charge.

01:33:01.820 --> 01:33:04.520
I think I'm moving hard to the
top, I'm moving hard to the top.

01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:07.400
Okay, get ready.

01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:12.220
I'm close to the ceiling, don't
really touch the sides of anything.

01:33:33.610 --> 01:33:34.610
Okay.

01:33:37.330 --> 01:33:39.330
Now you're showing off.

01:33:39.870 --> 01:33:40.870
Maybe a little.

01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:13.160
Those looks good, guys.

01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:14.900
It's a death trap.

01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:15.920
Anything potential.

01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:19.540
Attack when it's closest.

01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:21.300
Get down!

01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:23.860
Go, go!

01:34:35.450 --> 01:34:41.250
I have a code 30, PD 36307, requesting
airless support dockside queens.

01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:50.230
It's gonna get a little crazy.

01:34:50.890 --> 01:34:51.890
It's already crazy.

01:34:52.510 --> 01:34:53.510
You didn't lay on us.

01:34:54.570 --> 01:34:57.350
Whatever happens, I promise
I'm going to protect you guys.

01:34:57.630 --> 01:34:58.670
We'll protect each other.

01:34:59.150 --> 01:35:00.150
Don't run this together.

01:35:01.150 --> 01:35:02.150
Right? Yeah.

01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:06.350
Okay, we are still not doing our work.

01:35:07.150 --> 01:35:08.670
I know, that's not cool.

01:35:08.671 --> 01:35:10.130
Let's go, now go back.

01:35:10.590 --> 01:35:11.590
All right, go, go, go.

01:35:22.210 --> 01:35:23.470
This doesn't look safe.

01:35:24.030 --> 01:35:26.890
Well, it's full of explosives
and it's structurally unsound.

01:35:27.050 --> 01:35:28.170
Yeah, it doesn't sound safe.

01:35:28.890 --> 01:35:29.890
It's a death trap.

01:35:31.290 --> 01:35:32.290
That's a good thing.

01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:34.570
As long as we're not
the one to get trapped.

01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:38.570
No matter what happens,
we need to work together.

01:35:41.310 --> 01:35:42.810
Well, let's make this time possible.

01:35:43.530 --> 01:35:44.910
Yeah, and we won't be impulsive.

01:35:45.870 --> 01:35:46.870
Are we ready?

01:35:52.290 --> 01:35:53.370
We have to get to the roof.

01:35:53.870 --> 01:35:55.070
It's gonna be here any minute.

01:35:55.290 --> 01:35:56.950
Here, take these.

01:35:57.650 --> 01:35:59.470
Put them in as many crates as you can.

01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:05.600
Okay.

01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:07.940
You two, go that way.

01:36:08.420 --> 01:36:09.460
We need to slow them down.

01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:09.980
Right.

01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:11.600
Keep them with me.

01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:18.600
I'm coming for you.

01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:25.960
I'm coming for you.

01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:34.580
I'm coming for you.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:10.540
Let it go, run, run for yourself.

01:37:19.770 --> 01:37:25.450
You are going to the south side.

01:37:25.451 --> 01:37:26.691
You're going to the south side.

01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:33.780
Keep your wings to the south side.

01:39:55.090 --> 01:39:56.570
I need you to help me.

01:39:59.370 --> 01:40:02.710
I need you to help me.

01:40:03.170 --> 01:40:04.810
I need you to help me.

01:40:04.811 --> 01:40:14.310
I need you to help me.

01:40:15.470 --> 01:40:19.470
You can't stay all free.

01:40:19.471 --> 01:40:27.090
And when you take on the response
of duty, great power will come.

01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:40.130
You're gonna be okay.

01:41:05.690 --> 01:41:13.390
I need you to help me.

01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:20.040
What makes you so short?

01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:56.660
You look like a change in the future.

01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:36.520
I need you to help me.

01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:03.400
We're still here crossing you.

01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:04.580
We're not leaving you.

01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:08.520
I wouldn't be here if I
weren't for the three of you.

01:45:08.940 --> 01:45:09.940
Right back at you.

01:45:10.970 --> 01:45:13.320
And so the twin of the
baby's doing really well.

01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:15.240
He's loving being an uncle.

01:45:15.985 --> 01:45:18.800
Yeah, all the fun and
none of the responsibility.

01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:21.790
That's what he thinks.

01:45:25.310 --> 01:45:27.020
Are you all immediate family?

01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:29.040
Yes.

01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:31.120
They're all mine.

01:45:38.810 --> 01:45:39.810
Can I get you anything?

01:45:40.370 --> 01:45:41.370
No.

01:45:42.270 --> 01:45:43.950
I have everything I need right here.

01:46:17.730 --> 01:46:19.600
You left your junk mail downstairs.

01:46:20.980 --> 01:46:23.040
And we got take-out.

01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:25.300
I don't know how chicken is perfect.

01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:26.740
Actually, no.

01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:28.800
Bless you, Anya.

01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:30.040
What? Thank you.

01:46:37.580 --> 01:46:38.000
Maddie!

01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:38.820
What?

01:46:39.220 --> 01:46:40.220
I told you I'm starving.

01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:42.160
And I told you that is pretty good.

01:46:42.161 --> 01:46:43.620
I wouldn't like you if you were hungry.

01:46:43.621 --> 01:46:46.620
Well, I wouldn't, so...

01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:48.620
How should I say?

01:46:48.810 --> 01:46:50.500
I can see better than I ever have.

01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:51.840
Oh, yeah?

01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:54.320
Can you see us in the future?

01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:56.200
Yes.

01:46:57.560 --> 01:46:58.740
I can see you.

01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:02.120
Standing up for what you believe.

01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:09.140
Never looking back.

01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:17.500
Considering you are always
more powerful than you thought.

01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:20.560
Nothing I didn't already know.

01:47:23.140 --> 01:47:25.620
I don't know about you two, but...

01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:27.760
That totally makes sense to me.

01:47:28.340 --> 01:47:29.340
What? I'm serious.

01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:30.880
Wow.

01:47:32.420 --> 01:47:33.860
Wow, I'm being serious.

01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:52.350
Whatever the future holds.

01:47:56.730 --> 01:47:57.730
We'll be ready.

01:48:00.370 --> 01:48:02.170
I don't know the best
thing about the future.

01:48:04.270 --> 01:48:05.350
It has nothing left.
