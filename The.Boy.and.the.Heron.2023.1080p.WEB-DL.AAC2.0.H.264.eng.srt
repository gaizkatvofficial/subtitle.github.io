1
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,916
- Mister Shoichi?
- His room.

2
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,207
Your mother's hospital's on fire!

3
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:14,666
Mother!

4
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:20,124
I'll go too!

5
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,957
Stay here, Mahito!

6
00:01:58,542 --> 00:01:59,666
<i>Mother...</i>

7
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:22,082
<i>Three years into the war,
Mother died.</i>

8
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,582
<i>Four years in,
I left Tokyo with Father.</i>

9
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:38,374
THE BOY AND THE HERON

10
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:45,916
<i>"Saginuma Station"</i>

11
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:17,499
That's her.

12
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,916
<i>She looked exactly like Mother.</i>

13
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:34,457
Did you wait long?

14
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,374
We just arrived.

15
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:39,874
You're Mahito?
I'm Natsuko..

16
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:44,207
Sorry I'm late.
We had a flat tire on the way.

17
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,624
You've grown up.

18
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,499
I've met you once, when you were a baby.

19
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,416
The factory first?

20
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,749
Yes. I'll be back for dinner.

21
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,082
Perfect timing.

22
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,374
Come, let's go.

23
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,874
That's heavy.

24
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,207
After you.

25
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:25,749
To the residence.

26
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:40,207
Mahito, I'm going to be your
new mother. Did you know?

27
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:43,582
Your hand.

28
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,666
Go on, put it here.

29
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:51,957
Feel it moving?

30
00:04:54,917 --> 00:04:58,332
A baby. Your little
brother or sister.

31
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,249
I'm so delighted.

32
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,582
Oh, stop here.

33
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,916
<i>"May your luck last long in battle"
"Congratulations on your call-up"</i>

34
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:58,624
Alright, we're here.

35
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,416
Take the luggage in.
Sure.

36
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,666
Mahito, let's go.

37
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:22,957
It's your first time,
so we'll enter from the front.

38
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:31,666
Look, over there.
That building.

39
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,874
Your father's new factory

40
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,624
Let's visit it sometime.

41
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,166
Oh dear, no one's in.

42
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,999
Bring your shoes with you.

43
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:36,624
How rare. It's never
flown inside before.

44
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:55,707
That nosy gray heron.
It must be welcoming you.

45
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,707
Well well.

46
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,249
Opened Shoichi's trunk again?

47
00:08:32,417 --> 00:08:34,206
Well, m'lady...

48
00:08:34,332 --> 00:08:36,916
The pedicab man came,
ya see!

49
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:38,956
He left it here.

50
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:39,916
Yup, yup.

51
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:41,749
Didn't know whose it was.

52
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:42,999
Yup, yup.

53
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,041
It smells so sweet...

54
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:46,916
So we just..

55
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:51,499
This is Shoichi's son, Mahito.

56
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,449
- What?!
- Canned beef!

57
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:39,749
Tasty when cooked with rice!

58
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,582
Canned salmon!
Gimme the bones!

59
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:45,832
Corned beef!
You can still get it?

60
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,791
And lastly...

61
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:49,916
- Sugar!
- Good for rice cakes!

62
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:51,166
Sweet bean paste!

63
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:54,666
- Sweet rice cakes!
- Pure white sugar!

64
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:56,207
Gimme a taste!

65
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,499
Me too!

66
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,041
We can go now.

67
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:02,707
So some places still have it!

68
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,541
He's his mother's spitting image.

69
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,041
Such a pretty boy.

70
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,374
I hope he stays safe...

71
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,832
You got smokes?!

72
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,499
Gimme one!

73
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:33,624
This is your room.

74
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:39,207
You must be tired.
I'll bring tea.

75
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,499
Mom!

76
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,666
Mahito... Goodbye...

77
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:42,499
Mom! I'm coming!

78
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:44,832
Mahito...

79
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,041
Mom...

80
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,332
Mahito!

81
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:26,124
Sonny!

82
00:16:26,292 --> 00:16:28,374
Better head back!

83
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,124
The lady's worried about ya!

84
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:34,874
Sonny!

85
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,624
That used to be sealed off.

86
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,457
He'll get taken..

87
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:47,582
Sonny!

88
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:49,707
Thank goodness.

89
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:50,999
What is this?

90
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,416
There's a staircase.
What's this place?

91
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:57,999
Well...

92
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,499
Better head back.

93
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,499
The feathers are gone...

94
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:13,457
I was saving this story for
when you get settled in here.

95
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:19,457
That tower was built by
my mother's uncle, I was told.

96
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,915
He was a very smart man,

97
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,832
but read too many books,
and lost his mind.

98
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:32,666
<i>One day, a long time
before I was born,</i>

99
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:38,291
<i>he disappeared, leaving only
an open book he hadn't finished.</i>

100
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:43,332
<i>They looked everywhere,
but couldn't find any trace.</i>

101
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:49,832
<i>Later, in a flood, a passage
to the main house collapsed</i>

102
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:53,874
<i>and beneath the tower,. a
maze of tunnels was found.</i>

103
00:17:55,417 --> 00:17:59,999
For safety, my grandfather
had the entrance sealed.

104
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,957
You mustn't go near it either.

105
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,207
Yes ma'am.
Thank you for the tea.

106
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:10,957
Good night.

107
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,916
Good night. Mornings are cold,
so sleep warm.

108
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:16,082
Yes ma'am.

109
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:19,124
Mahito, save me...

110
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:33,707
You're home.

111
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:35,041
I'm home.

112
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,541
Navy boys are all flustered.

113
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,666
They boasted Saipan
would hold for a year.

114
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:20,707
I pity those who died...

115
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,207
The factory's booming though.

116
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:26,249
We'll take the Datsun to school.

117
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:31,407
A transfer student arriving by car
will shock everyone.

118
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:38,707
Don't worry.
We've spoken to the teachers.

119
00:20:39,042 --> 00:20:40,082
Off you go.

120
00:20:46,964 --> 00:20:51,064
{\an4}<i>"Agricultural volunteers"</i>

121
00:20:57,815 --> 00:21:01,115
{\an9}<i>"Mahito Maki"</i>

122
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:24,416
Mahito, tell me the truth.
Who did this to you?

123
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:27,291
I just took a tumble.

124
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:33,749
Rest assured. I'll avenge you,
So tell me the truth.

125
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,041
Shoichi...

126
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,791
I won't let them get away with this!

127
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,791
I'll go to his school.

128
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:52,541
Mahito!
Save me!

129
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,166
Mahito!

130
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:10,874
Ow!

131
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:18,541
Oh my!

132
00:23:21,042 --> 00:23:21,457
Mahito!

133
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:23,499
Shut this!

134
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:45,999
Mom! Mom!

135
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,041
M'lady, please get some rest.

136
00:24:06,042 --> 00:24:09,582
We'll take turns
keeping an eye on him.

137
00:27:14,042 --> 00:27:17,291
What are you?!
Not an ordinary gray heron!

138
00:27:23,417 --> 00:27:28,166
It seems the long-awaited
one has appeared at last.

139
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:31,874
I shall now guide you to your mother.

140
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:35,999
My mother?! How dare you!
My mother died!

141
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:44,291
A typical human trick.
She ain't dead.

142
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:50,374
Pardon me, but you did not
see your mother's dead body.

143
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:58,041
She is awaiting your rescue.

144
00:27:58,375 --> 00:28:00,082
Please join us...

145
00:28:00,785 --> 00:28:02,585
Please join us...

146
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,699
Join us...

147
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:16,082
Mahito!

148
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,500
Mahito!

149
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,300
Mahito!

150
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:37,832
Sonny!

151
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:41,832
Your presence is requested.

152
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:36,249
You're awake?
Thank heavens.

153
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:45,582
You were out for so long
and we were so worried.

154
00:29:46,542 --> 00:29:47,749
The gray heron...

155
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:49,541
Gray heron?

156
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:52,832
Is it near?

157
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:54,916
A dream, perhaps?

158
00:29:55,042 --> 00:29:57,582
Mahito!
You're awake.

159
00:29:57,708 --> 00:30:01,666
Rest assured.
I'll catch who did this to you.

160
00:30:01,792 --> 00:30:03,332
I was just clumsy.

161
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:06,041
Don't worry.
No school for now.

162
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:09,457
I donated 300 yen.
The principal was shocked.

163
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:14,291
Those teachers barely teach.
Too much voluntary labor.

164
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:19,041
That might leave a bald spot.

165
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,291
It'll get covered up.

166
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:27,332
Natsuko isn't feeling well.
She's probably tired.

167
00:30:28,042 --> 00:30:29,666
Try not to worry her.

168
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:36,624
The railway's stopped again.

171
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:56,249
Sonny, take it easy and lie down.

172

Yes sir.

Magnificent, aren't they?

179
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:10,457

Go see her.

182
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,874
Yes sir.

183
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:24,374
Men, well done!
Rest, then return to the factory!

184

Ain't to your liking, is it?

185
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:35,874
It tastes awful

186

Straight talker, huh?

187
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,416
Oh, hey!
You got tobacco?!

188
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:48,666
Knotweed leaves.
Wanna puff?

189

Heck nah,

she wants to see you.

193
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:13,666
Pay her a visit.

194
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:15,207
Is she very sick?

195
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:21,166
Morning sickness. Carrying a baby
causes some women a lotta pain.

196

I ate it though.

334
00:57:19,042 --> 00:57:22,999
A big wave's coming.
After that, plain sailing.

335
00:58:13,292 --> 00:58:14,957
Where'd you come from?

336
00:58:16,542 --> 00:58:17,666
Up above...

337
00:58:19,375 --> 00:58:21,374
Is it a nice place?

338
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,416
Not for me.

339
00:58:26,861 --> 00:58:29,961
Have you seen a woman named Natsuko?

340
00:58:30,958 --> 00:58:33,249
Are you sweet on her?

341
00:58:35,458 --> 00:58:39,749
My father is...
I'm trying to find her.

342
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:43,249
And what are you called?

343
00:58:45,667 --> 00:58:46,582
Mahito.

344
00:58:47,375 --> 00:58:49,082
Meaning <i>"sincere one"</i>...

345
00:58:49,542 --> 00:58:53,041
So that's why you reek of death.

346
00:58:54,042 --> 00:58:54,957
Look.

347
00:58:59,125 --> 00:59:00,791
None are real.

348
00:59:01,708 --> 00:59:04,666
In this world,
the dead are the majority.

349
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:11,582
Stop rowing.

350
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:44,957
Who are they?

351
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:47,791
Buyers coming for our catch

352
00:59:48,375 --> 00:59:49,916
They saw that flag.

353
00:59:52,625 --> 00:59:56,999
They're not able to kill.
That's my job.

354
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:43,416
Get off.
Help me.

355
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,582
The warawara are coming.

356
01:01:14,042 --> 01:01:15,707
No dilly-dallying!

357
01:01:16,208 --> 01:01:18,374
That fish needs carving!

358
01:01:31,167 --> 01:01:32,707
Lend a hand.

359
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,082
You try.

360
01:02:02,375 --> 01:02:03,499
Right there.

361
01:02:07,833 --> 01:02:08,957
Deeper!

362
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:17,832
Pull hard!

363
01:02:27,375 --> 01:02:29,374
Don't spill the guts!

364
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:33,207
Warawara eat them so they can fly

365
01:03:28,708 --> 01:03:30,082
Hey, get up and eat.

366
01:03:31,292 --> 01:03:33,624
Don't touch those dolls.

367
01:04:00,833 --> 01:04:04,374
They look like the grannies
at the residence.

368
01:04:06,458 --> 01:04:08,291
They're protecting you.

369
01:04:09,542 --> 01:04:11,082
Water's over there.

370
01:04:35,833 --> 01:04:36,916
Kiriko.

371
01:04:37,542 --> 01:04:40,124
How do you know my damn name?

372
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:42,374
It's Kiriko, right?

373
01:04:42,958 --> 01:04:48,416
This world isn't like mine,
but some things are similar.

374
01:04:49,083 --> 01:04:51,374
I've always been here.

375
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,374
The Kiriko I know is an
old lady, like those dolls.

376
01:04:57,208 --> 01:04:58,541
Hurry up and eat.

377
01:04:59,583 --> 01:05:00,749
Toilet?

378
01:05:01,292 --> 01:05:03,457
Out there, in the yard.

379
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:04,874
Thank you.

380
01:06:57,125 --> 01:06:57,916
Kiriko!

381
01:07:00,375 --> 01:07:01,999
They mature, then fly.

382
01:07:03,375 --> 01:07:05,916
They haven't flown for so long

383
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:19,150
Little ones see them off.

384
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:21,041
Where are they going?

385
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:23,374
- To be born.
- What?

386
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:27,041
Where you came from.
To be born up above.

387
01:07:27,167 --> 01:07:28,291
As people?

388
01:07:28,542 --> 01:07:29,499
What else?

389
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:52,374
I'm glad we could feed them well.

390
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:11,416
Pelicans! Dammit,
they'll eat them all!

391
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:26,957
Lady Himi!

392
01:08:43,083 --> 01:08:44,207
The warawara are burning!

393
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:51,124
Stop it!
Don't burn the warawara!

394
01:08:52,083 --> 01:08:53,374
Stop!

395
01:09:00,417 --> 01:09:03,374
Damn birds'll stay away for now.

396
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:06,791
Without Lady Himi,
no more warawara.

397
01:09:06,917 --> 01:09:09,124
Lady Himi!
Thank you!

398
01:09:21,583 --> 01:09:24,499
No more'll fly tonight.
Let's eat..

399
01:09:52,542 --> 01:09:54,832
Sorry grannies...

400
01:10:38,958 --> 01:10:42,541
Young one, put me out
of my misery.

401
01:10:42,667 --> 01:10:45,541
My wing is broken.
I can not fly.

402
01:10:46,833 --> 01:10:49,416
You should've left
the warawara alone!

403
01:10:50,542 --> 01:10:54,249
My kind were brought to
this hellscape.

404
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:58,041
So we would eat the warawara.

405
01:10:58,958 --> 01:11:02,707
This sea has few fish we can eat.

406
01:11:04,292 --> 01:11:07,166
My kind were all starving.

407
01:11:08,292 --> 01:11:11,374
<i>We flew as high as we could.</i>

408
01:11:11,542 --> 01:11:15,332
<i>As high and far
as our wings could carry us.</i>

409
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:19,916
But... it always ended the same way.

410
01:11:20,167 --> 01:11:22,749
We could only reach this island.

411
01:11:26,875 --> 01:11:30,874
Now our newborns
are forgetting how to fly.

412
01:11:31,625 --> 01:11:34,541
We eat the warawara...

413
01:11:34,667 --> 01:11:37,624
The fire maiden burns us.

414
01:11:41,375 --> 01:11:46,166
The sea here...
is cursed...

415
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:57,791
Rest in peace...
It was such a noble pelican...

416
01:12:02,667 --> 01:12:06,457
Ah! You still have that?

417
01:12:06,708 --> 01:12:07,999
Hey, wait!

418
01:12:12,208 --> 01:12:14,582
Natsuko isn't here,
you know..

419
01:12:14,708 --> 01:12:15,791
I know.

420
01:12:16,667 --> 01:12:18,874
How about I take you to her?

421
01:12:19,792 --> 01:12:21,541
I'll find her myself.

422
01:12:23,375 --> 01:12:25,749
Wait.
Hey, chief!

423
01:12:31,917 --> 01:12:33,999
Arrogant little turd!

424
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:45,082
You'll bury it...?

425
01:13:01,583 --> 01:13:02,374
Okay!

426
01:13:02,625 --> 01:13:04,457
I'm such a pushover.

427
01:13:04,583 --> 01:13:05,624
Stop!

428
01:13:06,333 --> 01:13:08,707
Too far! Come back.

429
01:13:09,875 --> 01:13:10,874
Alright.

430
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:15,332
Can't stomach this.

431
01:13:16,417 --> 01:13:19,124
Don't blame me if
Natsuko gets eaten.

432
01:13:19,708 --> 01:13:22,416
You said you'd eat my heart.

433
01:13:28,167 --> 01:13:28,999
Sorry...

434
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:30,624
Ow!

435
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:36,374
Spit it out.
Where is Natsuko?!

436
01:13:37,875 --> 01:13:38,832
I'll rip this!

437
01:13:39,333 --> 01:13:41,874
Try it!
I'll tear you apart!

438
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:47,082
Ow ow ow!
Please stop!

439
01:13:47,708 --> 01:13:50,249
You okay?
I hardly ripped it.

440
01:13:54,542 --> 01:13:55,541
It's ripped now.

441
01:14:10,917 --> 01:14:15,041
This is crummy tea,
but drink and make up.

442
01:14:15,792 --> 01:14:17,916
We didn't fight.

443
01:14:18,042 --> 01:14:22,457
He's a liar and a cheat,
but I know he took Natsuko.

444
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:25,957
I hate to say it,
but you overestimate me.

445
01:14:26,083 --> 01:14:28,499
The wise cheat to survive.

446
01:14:28,958 --> 01:14:32,666
A gray heron told me
all gray herons are liars.

447
01:14:32,917 --> 01:14:35,249
Is that the truth,
 or a lie?

448
01:14:35,708 --> 01:14:36,999
- A lie!
- The truth!

449
01:14:37,833 --> 01:14:41,874
It's the truth...
All gray herons are liars.

450
01:14:42,208 --> 01:14:43,457
That's a lie too!

451
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:45,124
This lie is true.

452
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:53,332
You're a-fine pair...
Go search for Natsuko together.

453
01:14:54,167 --> 01:14:56,374
I have to tend to the warawara.

454
01:14:56,542 --> 01:14:59,374
The tower master
told you to guide him.

455
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,041
Stay vigilant,
and work together. Go.

456
01:15:19,708 --> 01:15:20,832
It's Kiriko!

457
01:15:21,167 --> 01:15:23,332
For good luck.
Take it.

458
01:15:24,292 --> 01:15:25,541
Will we meet again?

459
01:15:25,708 --> 01:15:26,832
Who knows?

460
01:15:27,167 --> 01:15:28,291
Thank you!

461
01:15:28,667 --> 01:15:29,832
Do your best.

462
01:15:40,208 --> 01:15:41,707
Miss Natsuko!

463
01:15:48,833 --> 01:15:51,541
I'll get some men to stay here!

464
01:15:51,667 --> 01:15:56,541
No, the factory mustn't stop.
Please return to your work.

465
01:15:56,667 --> 01:15:59,249
Alright! We'll always be on call!

466
01:15:59,375 --> 01:16:00,999
Okay.
Thanks.

467
01:16:11,958 --> 01:16:16,249
We've searched the pond,
the hills, everywhere.

468
01:16:16,625 --> 01:16:19,166
Natsuko, Mahito, and Kiriko.

469
01:16:19,542 --> 01:16:22,832
A triple disappearance is unheard of.

470
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:24,832
Say, Mister Shoichi...

471
01:16:25,583 --> 01:16:29,624
Every now and then,
strange things happen here...

472
01:16:30,083 --> 01:16:34,874
I've been working here
for a good 60 years now,

473
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:39,624
and that tower out in
the yard just ain't right.

474
01:16:41,083 --> 01:16:44,499
That thing sure weren't
built by people.

475
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:47,082
Oh come on,
scary stories now?

476
01:16:47,708 --> 01:16:51,957
Just before the Meiji Revolution,
it fell outta the sky!

477
01:17:00,208 --> 01:17:04,332
Rumble rumble,
BOOOOOM!

478
01:17:05,542 --> 01:17:08,249
With an earth-rattling crash.

479
01:17:08,792 --> 01:17:10,249
Like thunder?

480
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:16,291
There used to be a big pond,
but the water all dried up.

481
01:17:16,417 --> 01:17:19,041
That tower stands there now.

482
01:17:33,375 --> 01:17:38,166
From what I heard,
Natsuko's clever granduncle had it built.

483
01:17:38,375 --> 01:17:41,916
No siree,
it came down from the sky!

484
01:17:42,042 --> 01:17:45,332
Everybody was too scared to go near.

485
01:17:46,042 --> 01:17:51,082
<i>After 30-odd years, the forest
grew back, and the thing got buried.</i>

486
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:55,707
<i>Then, the grand uncle discovered it.</i>

487
01:17:56,208 --> 01:17:58,957
He became obsessed with it...

488
01:17:59,083 --> 01:18:03,916
Because it was so rare,
he built the tower around it.

489
01:18:16,292 --> 01:18:19,541
So many people died or got hurt.

490
01:18:19,667 --> 01:18:23,457
Plus, the granduncle
vanished into the tower...

491
01:18:23,583 --> 01:18:24,999
He sure did.

492
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:31,332
Mahito's mother, Hisako,
also went missing once.

493
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:35,957
<i>We searched the whole village.</i>

494
01:18:36,417 --> 01:18:40,582
<i>Then after a year,
she came back, fit as a fiddle.</i>

495
01:18:41,042 --> 01:18:43,874
Looking the same as she was before.

496
01:18:44,042 --> 01:18:48,374
No memory of it,
and grinning, but...

497
01:18:49,542 --> 01:18:50,916
Bizarre, ain't it?

498
01:18:53,083 --> 01:18:54,582
We have the tower key?

499
01:18:55,042 --> 01:18:56,707
Yes sir, I think...

500
01:18:56,875 --> 01:18:58,166
I'll go there now.

501
01:19:16,417 --> 01:19:17,791
I'm pooped...

502
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:22,582
These legs weren't made for walking.

503
01:19:23,708 --> 01:19:27,666
I won't be able to make it
to where Natsuko is.

504
01:19:27,958 --> 01:19:31,624
If only I could block this hole,
I could fly...

505
01:19:32,292 --> 01:19:34,124
Shove a stick in it or something.

506
01:19:34,917 --> 01:19:40,041
Easy to say. The hole maker
has to fill it, or it won't work!

507
01:19:40,708 --> 01:19:42,707
Is that lie true?

508
01:19:42,958 --> 01:19:45,082
I never tell lies!

509
01:19:50,375 --> 01:19:52,416
Be gentle.

510
01:20:01,792 --> 01:20:04,207
Make that part smoother...

511
01:20:04,375 --> 01:20:05,582
Shut up.

512
01:20:08,292 --> 01:20:12,291
It's through! Gently,
or you'll break your beak.

513
01:20:14,708 --> 01:20:15,749
How's that?

514
01:20:24,458 --> 01:20:28,499
Look at me,
gorgeous and powerful!

515
01:20:29,875 --> 01:20:31,332
Can you fly?

516
01:20:33,667 --> 01:20:37,416
I ain't your friend or your ally, kid.

517
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:44,166
So long. You'll have to find Natsuko,
and get out of here,

518
01:20:44,292 --> 01:20:46,957
all on your lonesome...

519
01:20:54,542 --> 01:20:55,707
It came out?

520
01:20:56,042 --> 01:20:57,749
No, it just.

521
01:20:58,917 --> 01:21:01,416
It sticks out a wee bit, so.

522
01:21:01,833 --> 01:21:04,749
Here! This part bugs me!

523
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,082
There! There!
Oh, don't take too much off.

524
01:21:08,208 --> 01:21:09,707
Shut up.

525
01:21:14,375 --> 01:21:15,666
It's a home.

526
01:21:15,667 --> 01:21:18,999
The blacksmith's.
Shh! Duck down!

527
01:21:23,667 --> 01:21:25,041
That's a big parakeet

528
01:21:25,208 --> 01:21:28,916
Weird... Why are they
hanging around?

529
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:30,874
They ate the blacksmith?

530
01:21:31,083 --> 01:21:32,457
They eat people?!

531
01:21:32,583 --> 01:21:34,332
Elephants too.

532
01:21:35,375 --> 01:21:39,957
Like the pelicans, the master
brought them, and they bred.

533
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:46,207
Gotta pass through there,
or you can't get to Natsuko.

534
01:21:47,042 --> 01:21:50,166
I'll draw'em out,
then you dash in.

535
01:21:50,292 --> 01:21:51,374
I'll try.

536
01:22:53,792 --> 01:22:55,624
We have been waiting.

537
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,916
Is there a Natsuko here?
I'm looking for her.

538
01:23:01,917 --> 01:23:03,624
This way, sir.

539
01:23:25,855 --> 01:23:26,855
This way

540
01:23:27,542 --> 01:23:30,707
Damn you!
Is this how you ate Natsuko?!

541
01:23:31,208 --> 01:23:33,291
Natsuko has baby.

542
01:23:33,417 --> 01:23:34,791
We not eat baby.

543
01:23:35,292 --> 01:23:37,041
You not have baby

544
01:23:37,208 --> 01:23:38,791
Eatable! Eatable!

545
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:42,916
Himi! It's Himi!

546
01:23:59,958 --> 01:24:03,416
Stupid. Those parakeets
nearly stewed you.

547
01:24:04,375 --> 01:24:08,124
You're Himi?
Thank you for saving my life.

548
01:24:09,042 --> 01:24:12,041
You're that brat who
was with Kiriko.

549
01:24:12,833 --> 01:24:16,666
I'm Mahito. I'm looking for
someone called Natsuko.

550
01:24:17,208 --> 01:24:19,124
Natsuko...
My little sister?

551
01:24:20,042 --> 01:24:21,082
<i>"Little sister"?!</i>

552
01:24:24,167 --> 01:24:25,166
Come.

553
01:24:26,375 --> 01:24:27,499
Time's wasting.

554
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:03,791
This is my home.

555
01:25:37,583 --> 01:25:39,666
It's like a tower I know.

556
01:25:39,875 --> 01:25:41,999
Sure, it's the same one.

557
01:25:42,208 --> 01:25:45,666
It stands straddling
all kinds of worlds.

558
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,041
Come in.

559
01:26:16,542 --> 01:26:17,541
Eat it.

560
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:20,624
Hurry, the jam'll drip.

561
01:26:28,588 --> 01:26:31,188
Kiriki loves my bread too.

562
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:35,791
It's delicious!

563
01:26:36,333 --> 01:26:39,582
It's like the bread
my mother used to bake!

564
01:26:40,583 --> 01:26:42,624
Natsuko is your mother?

565
01:26:43,083 --> 01:26:44,166
She's not.

566
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:48,249
Natsuko is someone...
my father likes.

567
01:26:48,917 --> 01:26:50,707
My mother died.

568
01:26:51,208 --> 01:26:52,499
As did mine.

569
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:57,416
Eat lots. We'll be going
deep inside.

570
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:06,832
Careful. You get lost,
you never get out.

571
01:27:15,833 --> 01:27:16,999
It's guarded...

572
01:27:38,792 --> 01:27:42,957
Careful. In here,
my power has limits.

573
01:27:45,083 --> 01:27:46,166
This way.

574
01:27:55,792 --> 01:27:56,874
Doors to where?

575
01:27:57,042 --> 01:27:58,874
Quiet. You'll mess me up.

576
01:28:05,375 --> 01:28:06,332
This one.

577
01:28:09,042 --> 01:28:10,666
Don't get sucked in.

578
01:28:15,375 --> 01:28:16,374
Father?!

579
01:28:16,792 --> 01:28:18,374
That's your father?

580
01:28:19,125 --> 01:28:21,874
If you want to go home,
open this.

581
01:28:22,042 --> 01:28:24,874
But Natsuko...
I can't leave alone!

582
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,624
She doesn't want to leave.
She'll have her baby.

583
01:28:31,708 --> 01:28:32,749
Parakeets!

584
01:28:38,708 --> 01:28:41,707
We're trapped.
In here! Turn it hard!

585
01:28:42,125 --> 01:28:44,541
You mustn't let go. Ready?

586
01:28:46,042 --> 01:28:49,082
Grab the other knob! Shut the door!

587
01:28:54,875 --> 01:28:56,791
Where are we? Hold on!

588
01:28:58,208 --> 01:29:00,999
Once you let go, it's lost forever.

589
01:29:12,958 --> 01:29:14,124
It's Mahito!

590
01:29:18,375 --> 01:29:20,374
- Father!
- Want to stay?

591
01:29:20,708 --> 01:29:21,874
Just let go.

592
01:29:22,167 --> 01:29:23,874
Not without Natsuko!

593
01:29:31,458 --> 01:29:33,416
Taste my blade, monsters!

594
01:29:47,583 --> 01:29:49,749
Mahito turned into a parakeet.

595
01:29:50,375 --> 01:29:51,666
Father, I'm sorry

596
01:29:53,125 --> 01:29:54,666
Mister Shoichi.

597
01:29:54,917 --> 01:29:57,791
Mahito's a budgie now!

598
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:35,082
Don't touch the stone.

599
01:30:35,667 --> 01:30:38,041
It's not happy we're here.

600
01:30:47,292 --> 01:30:50,082
The delivery room.
Natsuko's there.

601
01:30:54,292 --> 01:30:57,957
The stone's aware of us,
and upset. I wouldn't go in.

602
01:30:59,583 --> 01:31:00,749
I have to go.

603
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:03,207
I'll wait here.

604
01:31:53,292 --> 01:31:56,207
Natsuko, it's Mahito.
Natsuko?

605
01:32:14,833 --> 01:32:18,791
Natsuko, it's Mahito!
I've come for you!

606
01:32:19,208 --> 01:32:21,666
Natsuko!
Let's go home!

607
01:32:25,333 --> 01:32:28,124
You...
What are you doing here?!

608
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:31,874
Go back!
Now!

609
01:32:35,583 --> 01:32:36,749
Let's go together!

610
01:32:38,125 --> 01:32:40,791
I absolutely hate you!
Get out!

611
01:32:44,333 --> 01:32:46,541
Go back!
Now!

612
01:32:56,250 --> 01:32:58,541
Natsuko...
Mother!

613
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,124
Mother!

614
01:33:07,708 --> 01:33:09,666
Mother!
Let's go home!

615
01:33:19,167 --> 01:33:20,582
Mahito, run!

616
01:33:24,083 --> 01:33:25,582
Natsuko!
Mother!

617
01:34:11,875 --> 01:34:15,749
Master of the great stone,
hear my plea...

618
01:34:16,917 --> 01:34:20,374
Let my sister lying there...
go home...

619
01:34:20,792 --> 01:34:23,707
...with this boy who
will be her son.

620
01:34:27,167 --> 01:34:31,416
Natsuko. Natsuko.
Come to me.

621
01:34:31,958 --> 01:34:33,707
Up you get.

622
01:34:39,208 --> 01:34:42,666
That's it. Good girl.
Come to me..

623
01:36:28,458 --> 01:36:31,832
You have come,
my descendant.

624
01:36:35,792 --> 01:36:37,207
My name is Mahito.

625
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:40,874
You're the tower master?
My great-granduncle?

626
01:36:41,667 --> 01:36:44,957
Wait there.
Quietly.

627
01:37:13,583 --> 01:37:15,207
Now this world...

628
01:37:17,208 --> 01:37:19,457
...will last another day.

629
01:37:20,917 --> 01:37:24,416
Another day?!
It only lasts that long?

630
01:37:25,333 --> 01:37:26,416
Come.

631
01:38:23,208 --> 01:38:24,666
My world,

632
01:38:25,292 --> 01:38:30,082
my power, everything,
comes from this stone.

633
01:38:30,875 --> 01:38:33,999
That stone created this sea world?

634
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,041
There is more to be done.

635
01:38:37,708 --> 01:38:41,999
Worlds are living things.
Mold and bugs infest them.

636
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:44,749
And I have grown old.

637
01:38:44,958 --> 01:38:47,707
I seek a successor.

638
01:38:50,292 --> 01:38:54,166
Mahito, will you continue my work?

639
01:38:55,042 --> 01:38:56,166
Me...?

640
01:38:56,625 --> 01:39:01,541
My successor must come
from my bloodline.

641
01:39:01,667 --> 01:39:04,166
That is my contract with the stone.

642
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:08,041
Whether this world becomes beautiful,

643
01:39:08,208 --> 01:39:12,082
or an abomination,
is entirely in your hands.

644
01:39:12,750 --> 01:39:14,499
You mean your blocks?

645
01:39:16,208 --> 01:39:19,541
You may add one of these blocks to it.

646
01:39:25,667 --> 01:39:30,041
You can make this world
a more harmonious place.

647
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,707
Those aren't wooden.

648
01:39:36,208 --> 01:39:39,166
It's stone for making tombs.
It's malicious.

649
01:39:43,375 --> 01:39:44,707
Correct.

650
01:39:44,833 --> 01:39:47,749
That knowledge is why
I choose you.

651
01:40:39,208 --> 01:40:40,207
Thank you!

652
01:40:40,542 --> 01:40:41,874
Save the chit-chat!

653
01:41:03,375 --> 01:41:04,666
Himi's been caught.

654
01:41:04,958 --> 01:41:06,124
She'll be fine.

655
01:41:06,250 --> 01:41:07,374
We must save her!

656
01:42:03,375 --> 01:42:04,707
Is Himi alright?

657
01:42:04,833 --> 01:42:07,249
They'll take her to their lord.

658
01:42:07,375 --> 01:42:08,416
Their lord?

659
01:42:08,542 --> 01:42:10,166
Your great-granduncle.

660
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:14,874
They'll use her
to make a deal with him.

661
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,166
A deal?

662
01:42:16,625 --> 01:42:18,791
So they get everything.

663
01:42:19,083 --> 01:42:21,916
The tower's full of parakeets now.

664
01:42:22,833 --> 01:42:25,999
Your transgression
gave them an excuse.

665
01:42:26,042 --> 01:42:27,207
<i>"Transgression"?</i>

666
01:42:27,333 --> 01:42:30,916
The taboo.
You entered the delivery room.

667
01:42:31,042 --> 01:42:32,166
A no-no.

668
01:42:34,708 --> 01:42:36,666
But Himi didn't enter.

669
01:42:36,792 --> 01:42:38,832
Taking you was taboo too.

670
01:42:40,083 --> 01:42:41,624
This is a lookout.

671
01:42:46,375 --> 01:42:47,416
Higher!

672
01:42:54,708 --> 01:42:58,582
Subjects, this is far enough!
Await good news!

673
01:42:59,333 --> 01:43:01,374
Let us accompany you!

674
01:43:01,542 --> 01:43:03,207
Please let us!

675
01:43:04,667 --> 01:43:09,666
Your sincerity is appreciated!
However, this is my duty.

676
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,832
Subjects, live well!

677
01:43:14,917 --> 01:43:17,407
Three cheers for our parakeet king!

678
01:45:05,708 --> 01:45:06,999
Be still!

679
01:45:07,375 --> 01:45:11,374
We carry Lady Himi,
our lord's descendant!

680
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,374
Yield to us!

681
01:45:22,750 --> 01:45:24,124
H-Heaven!

682
01:45:24,250 --> 01:45:25,582
Our ancestors!

683
01:45:28,792 --> 01:45:29,999
Paradise!

684
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,374
Your Majesty,
is this paradise?

685
01:45:33,458 --> 01:45:34,707
Be silent.

686
01:45:35,083 --> 01:45:36,374
Look at that!

687
01:45:36,583 --> 01:45:37,999
So pretty...

688
01:45:56,042 --> 01:45:58,999
So, you made it.
Have a seat.

689
01:45:59,792 --> 01:46:01,666
No, we shall walk.

690
01:46:22,875 --> 01:46:26,041
Entering the delivery room was wrong.

691
01:46:26,167 --> 01:46:30,249
It is no laughing matter.
A grave transgression.

692
01:46:31,417 --> 01:46:35,874
Unquestionably. The stone
is shimmering dangerously.

693
01:46:36,417 --> 01:46:39,249
Nevertheless,
young souls are precious.

694
01:46:40,333 --> 01:46:44,249
As king, I cannot
disregard a transgressor.

695
01:46:45,083 --> 01:46:50,291
Give me time. I want Mahito
to become my successor.

696
01:47:16,042 --> 01:47:17,041
Granduncle...

697
01:47:19,542 --> 01:47:22,832
We must protect our world,
or it shall perish.

698
01:47:23,458 --> 01:47:28,416
Mahito is a good boy.
It seems I must let him go.

699
01:47:32,542 --> 01:47:33,666
Granduncle!

700
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,582
You must go too.

701
01:48:01,458 --> 01:48:02,957
Th-That's it!

702
01:48:03,208 --> 01:48:04,457
That passage.

703
01:48:19,375 --> 01:48:21,166
I've been here before.

704
01:48:21,292 --> 01:48:22,374
Yow! Youch!

705
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:30,624
I've never been this far in before...

706
01:48:41,208 --> 01:48:43,249
We should return, Majesty!

707
01:48:43,375 --> 01:48:47,082
I shall go. Make sure
you make it back alive,

708
01:48:47,708 --> 01:48:50,082
and tell them I was a true king.

709
01:48:50,208 --> 01:48:51,999
- We will!
- Fare thee well!

710
01:49:30,792 --> 01:49:34,749
Hey chief, ain't it time
we got outta here?

711
01:49:34,833 --> 01:49:36,957
This way.
Himi's calling.

712
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:39,999
I can't hear diddly-squat...

713
01:49:42,375 --> 01:49:43,457
Himi!

714
01:49:48,208 --> 01:49:49,332
Mahito!

715
01:49:52,833 --> 01:49:56,041
Himi! Are you alright?!
Did they hurt you?!

716
01:49:56,208 --> 01:49:57,249
No!

717
01:49:58,125 --> 01:50:01,416
I thought I'd lost you.
I'm so glad!

718
01:50:07,458 --> 01:50:09,457
Granduncle's waiting for you.

719
01:50:09,708 --> 01:50:11,749
I know.
I'll go to him.

720
01:50:11,958 --> 01:50:14,291
This feels wrong.
Don't...

721
01:50:14,417 --> 01:50:15,457
Let's go.

722
01:50:20,042 --> 01:50:20,874
Huh?

723
01:50:26,375 --> 01:50:28,041
It's getting dark!

724
01:51:00,875 --> 01:51:02,249
Stone blocks...

725
01:51:04,250 --> 01:51:07,791
Better not touch them.
They're still powerful...

726
01:51:33,250 --> 01:51:36,207
Granduncle,
I've brought Mahito.

727
01:51:36,708 --> 01:51:37,749
Here I am.

728
01:51:41,542 --> 01:51:45,749
Look. These stones
are not stained with malice.

729
01:51:55,583 --> 01:52:00,332
I traveled the far reaches of
time and space to find them.

730
01:52:02,458 --> 01:52:07,749
There are 13 in all.
Stack them once every three days.

731
01:52:08,542 --> 01:52:13,791
Build your own tower.
A kingdom freed from malice.

732
01:52:15,667 --> 01:52:20,207
Create a world of bounty,
peace, and beauty.

733
01:52:32,958 --> 01:52:34,874
I made this scar myself.

734
01:52:36,042 --> 01:52:38,166
It's a sign of my malice.

735
01:52:40,667 --> 01:52:42,666
I can't touch those stones.

736
01:52:43,333 --> 01:52:46,082
I'll go back with Natsuko,
my mother.

737
01:52:47,125 --> 01:52:52,124
You'll return to a foolish world
of rampant murder and thievery?

738
01:52:52,958 --> 01:52:55,666
Soon it shall be consumed by flames.

739
01:52:56,250 --> 01:53:00,541
I'll make friends. Like Himi,
Kiriko, and the heron man.

740
01:53:01,542 --> 01:53:02,499
Me?

741
01:53:02,917 --> 01:53:08,499
Make friends. Return to your world.
But first, stack the stones.

742
01:53:09,167 --> 01:53:10,624
There is no time!

743
01:53:11,250 --> 01:53:13,624
I can not keep my tower standing.

744
01:53:24,292 --> 01:53:29,582
Traitor! You would place the fate
of the empire upon mere stones?!

745
01:53:37,292 --> 01:53:39,124
B-Be still. Still.

746
01:53:40,250 --> 01:53:41,332
Damn you!

747
01:53:53,458 --> 01:53:57,166
Himi! Mahito!
Return to the corridor of time!

748
01:53:57,292 --> 01:53:58,749
To your own time!

749
01:53:59,542 --> 01:54:00,916
Granduncle!

750
01:54:12,167 --> 01:54:15,291
The planet's splitting!
Grab on!

751
01:54:17,875 --> 01:54:19,374
Too much...

752
01:54:35,875 --> 01:54:38,166
Granduncle!
Thank you!

753
01:54:39,667 --> 01:54:40,666
Come on!

754
01:54:43,333 --> 01:54:44,707
Hurry, hurry!

755
01:55:10,708 --> 01:55:12,041
Miss Natsuko!

756
01:55:23,958 --> 01:55:25,874
This is it! Mahito, you go in.

757
01:55:26,042 --> 01:55:27,249
What about you?!

758
01:55:28,083 --> 01:55:31,541
Mine's another.
I'm going to be your mother.

759
01:55:32,083 --> 01:55:34,416
But you'll die in the hospital fire!

760
01:55:34,917 --> 01:55:38,582
Fire doesn't scare me.
I'll be so lucky to have you.

761
01:55:38,708 --> 01:55:41,166
No! Himi, you've got to live!

762
01:55:41,375 --> 01:55:43,374
You're a good boy!

763
01:55:49,667 --> 01:55:50,749
Holy moly!

764
01:55:53,333 --> 01:55:55,207
- Mother!
- Mahito!

765
01:55:55,333 --> 01:55:56,416
Thank goodness!

766
01:55:56,542 --> 01:55:59,541
- Sister!
- All the best for the birth.

767
01:55:59,708 --> 01:56:00,749
Now, hurry.

768
01:56:29,750 --> 01:56:31,332
How adorable!

769
01:56:55,667 --> 01:56:58,124
Hey!
This way!

770
01:57:06,792 --> 01:57:10,332
Good.
The pelicans made it out too.

771
01:57:10,542 --> 01:57:12,082
Hey, Mahito.

772
01:57:13,208 --> 01:57:15,874
Do you remember where we were?

773
01:57:16,208 --> 01:57:17,416
Of course I do.

774
01:57:17,542 --> 01:57:19,374
That's bad.
Forget.

775
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:20,499
Why?

776
01:57:20,625 --> 01:57:22,332
Forgetting is normal.

777
01:57:24,208 --> 01:57:26,082
No keepsakes, right?

778
01:57:33,875 --> 01:57:38,707
That's a powerful charm.
Way too powerful for me...

779
01:57:39,542 --> 01:57:41,791
That's one of them stones.

780
01:57:42,125 --> 01:57:44,499
From that field full of them.

781
01:57:44,792 --> 01:57:47,082
Can't trust amateurs like you.

782
01:57:47,921 --> 01:57:50,421
Well, that stone ain't powerful.

783
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:53,124
You'll forget in time.
You should.

784
01:57:58,458 --> 01:58:00,541
So long, friend.

785
01:58:12,958 --> 01:58:14,916
Ow ow ow!
Yeesh...

786
01:58:15,042 --> 01:58:16,082
Kiriko!

787
01:58:17,625 --> 01:58:18,582
The king?!

788
01:58:28,917 --> 01:58:31,207
Natsuko!
Mahito!

789
01:58:31,375 --> 01:58:32,999
- Shoichi!
- Father!

790
01:58:40,417 --> 01:58:41,674
<i>Two years after the war,</i>

791
01:58:44,375 --> 01:58:45,832
<i>we returned to Tokyo.</i>

792
01:58:48,625 --> 01:58:50,541
Hey!
Mahito!

793
01:58:52,042 --> 01:58:53,207
We're going!

794
01:58:54,292 --> 01:58:55,624
Coming!

795
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:36,666
<i>The clear sky on the day I was born</i>

796
01:59:38,292 --> 01:59:44,291
<i>was so high, distant, and endless</i>

797
01:59:46,375 --> 01:59:52,082
<i>The day I heard a voice
patting me on the back</i>

798
01:59:53,708 --> 01:59:58,082
<i>telling me to go ahead</i>

799
02:00:00,208 --> 02:00:05,874
<i>Faces I met in the seasons,</i>

800
02:00:07,500 --> 02:00:13,499
<i>at times hurting one another</i>

801
02:00:15,542 --> 02:00:21,332
<i>Shine by the light, the shadow extends</i>

802
02:00:22,667 --> 02:00:27,332
<i>as the sky grows further away</i>

803
02:00:32,042 --> 02:00:38,082
<i>I catch the wind and start running,
overcoming the rubble</i>

804
02:00:38,208 --> 02:00:44,207
<i>At the end of this road,
someone is waiting for me</i>

805
02:00:44,375 --> 02:00:51,374
<i>Dream of light shining through,
at any day of the week</i>

806
02:00:53,625 --> 02:00:59,666
<i>Open the door this moment,
like revealing hidden secrets</i>

807
02:00:59,792 --> 02:01:06,207
<i>Can't hold myself longing for more,
like the spinning globe</i>

808
02:01:18,542 --> 02:01:24,082
<i>The person I loved</i>

809
02:01:25,875 --> 02:01:31,791
<i>has gone to somewhere no one knows</i>

810
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:39,707
<i>With the usual kind
smile as any other day,</i>

811
02:01:41,250 --> 02:01:45,582
<i>still somewhere far away</i>

812
02:01:50,417 --> 02:01:56,499
<i>I take in the rain and start singing,
not minding if seen.</i>

813
02:01:56,625 --> 02:02:02,624
<i>This road continues
because I wished it would continue</i>

814
02:02:02,750 --> 02:02:09,916
<i>I dream of meeting again,
for ever and ever</i>

815
02:02:11,958 --> 02:02:17,874
<i>I grasped the fragment firmly,
so the secret remains</i>

816
02:02:18,042 --> 02:02:24,457
<i>I'll keep longing till the end,
like the spinning globe</i>

817
02:02:30,708 --> 02:02:37,374
<i>It all starts from an innocent wish
made long ago</i>

818
02:02:38,458 --> 02:02:46,207
<i>Carrying the loneliness in my heart,
I turn the corner</i>

819
02:02:49,583 --> 02:02:55,666
<i>I catch the wind and start running,
overcoming the rubble</i>

820
02:02:55,792 --> 02:03:01,791
<i>At the end of this road,
someone is waiting for me</i>

821
02:03:01,917 --> 02:03:09,041
<i>Dream of light shining through,
at any day of the week</i>

822
02:03:11,167 --> 02:03:17,207
<i>Open the door this moment,
like revealing hidden secrets</i>

823
02:03:17,333 --> 02:03:23,374
<i>The joy of holding ones hand,
the suffering of losing one.</i>
