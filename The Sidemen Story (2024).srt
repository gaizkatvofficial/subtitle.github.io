[electronic music playing]

2
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,279
[Vik] <i>When we all started at school,
they would laugh at us.</i>

3
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:25,640
They would say, "Why do you sit at home
and talk while you play games?

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,720
That's so weird."

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,560
<i>And to now where you say,
"I'm a YouTuber. I'm making videos."</i>

6
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,040
people go, "Ah! That's so cool."

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,920
[JJ] <i>If you told me ten years ago,
we're gonna be here,</i>

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,000
<i>I would've laughed.</i>

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,040
Ten years ago, I was just this kid
in my bedroom with a dream thinking,

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,760
"Oh, it'd be cool
to just make a few videos online

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,239
and see where it gets me."

12
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:45,919
Hey, guys. Ah, and...

13
00:00:45,919 --> 00:00:48,320
[all] ... welcome to The Sidemen Channel.

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,360
[cheering]

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,640
The Sidemen are a group of YouTubers
that are just smashing it right now.

16
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,120
[laughter]

17
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,080
The Sidemen pioneered the idea
of a YouTube group.

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,000
I don't think there's anyone
doing it bigger or better than them.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,200
[man] <i>They get 300 million plus views
every single month.</i>

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,920
<i>They get over a billion impressions
every month.</i>

21
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,960
244 million followers, and that is huge.

22
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,600
<i>It goes to show
how powerful a group can be.</i>

23
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,280
[crowd cheering]

24
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,600
The feds are gonna lock us up.

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,479
- They're gonna lock us up.
- We're totally getting arrested. [laughs]

26
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,720
[Tobi] <i>You can't plan relatability.</i>

27
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,479
It's a group of friends
organically having fun on camera.

28
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,080
Here we go!

29
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,679
[Tobi] <i>Something that you can't fake.</i>

30
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:42,000
You have this group of seven young men.
They all have such distinct personalities.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,880
<i>When they all come together,
it's just this amazing magic.</i>

32
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,440
[gasps]

33
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,119
Say it again!

34
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,119
[cheering]

35
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,839
[man] <i>We had experts come along</i>

36
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:55,759
<i>and the one resounding thing
that they always say is,</i>

37
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,640
<i>"Everything we do shouldn't work."</i>

38
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,280
It shouldn't work, but it does.

39
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,479
{\an8}The highest earning video is $587,000.

40
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,360
It makes sense. It is on 92 million views.

41
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,160
- Shout for KSI.
- Making way for the Sidemen.

42
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,920
[man] <i>The fact that KSI has blown up
is really helpful for the Sidemen.</i>

43
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,519
Thank you for having me.

44
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:23,280
- Ultimately, it's a great marketing tool.
- KSI!

45
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,640
[MrBeast] <i>A lot of people
want mainstream acceptance,</i>

46
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,560
<i>and they want acceptance by Hollywood.</i>

47
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,120
<i>But who the hell cares?</i>

48
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,840
<i>If you're a YouTuber getting
20-30 million views a video,</i>

49
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,519
you're getting more views than, you know,
the last ten movies to come out to buy.

50
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,079
Who cares what Hollywood thinks?

51
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:38,200
Yo.

52
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,920
For fuck's sake.

53
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,600
Everyone recognises that people
are watching channels on YouTube.

54
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,679
They're not watching
the TV screens any more.

55
00:02:46,679 --> 00:02:49,320
[man] <i>Behaviour changed
because technology changed</i>

56
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,000
and kids are the first ones who adapt.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,560
Do you think that the Sidemen Sundays
would be as popular if they were on TV?

58
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,679
- No.
- No.

59
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:57,840
TV's dead.

60
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,880
[laughs]

61
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,280
An online creator is able to give you

62
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,040
as much or as little of themselves
as they want, and it's not filtered.

63
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,440
And that is a level of engagement
that hasn't ever existed before.

64
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,480
I've been running myself into the ground

65
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,359
till like 4:00 or 5:00,
and like I do not feel okay.

66
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:16,799
What the Sidemen have is so much lore.

67
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,799
<i>We've got ten years' worth of experiences,
emotional ups and downs,</i>

68
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:24,239
where they're falling out
or not getting on as well.

69
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,239
...but I'm going home.
I'd rather get in the cab and fuck off.

70
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,079
Or the dynamics in the group are shifting.

71
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:32,280
I am no longer with the Sidemen.

72
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,760
But again, it's still content.

73
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,840
[cheering]

74
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,160
[Tobi] Bro, what is this?

75
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,679
It's a bit mad with fans,

76
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:40,200
like there's places we can't go.

77
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,119
[cheering]

78
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:45,200
We've kind of been swarmed
and locked in a little bit.

79
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,079
They're gonna hate me for saying this,

80
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:49,160
but it's like the One Direction
of YouTube.

81
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,679
{\an8}Yes. You might watch my videos,
but no, you're not invited to my house.

82
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:55,480
We had some kids run in
and kind of interrupt us mid-filming.

83
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,760
[shouting indistinctly]

84
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,880
[Josh] <i>I don't know
how much more mental it can get</i>

85
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,760
<i>and I don't wanna find out,
to be honest.</i>

86
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,280
[engine whirring]

87
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,479
We're dancing, bro. Jeez.

88
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,000
- [interviewer] How you doing, man?
- I'm good man. Good to be back.

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,560
- What you been up to since the...
- What have I been up to?

90
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,840
Bro, I've been, erm, well,
I went Seychelles for a little bit.

91
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,560
Er, about nine days. That was quite nice.

92
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,599
And now, I'm out here at Sidemen,

93
00:04:56,599 --> 00:05:01,360
and, er, we've got a crazy shoot
<i>Takeshi's Castle</i> style shoot.

94
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,240
- [interviewer] Mmm-hmm.
- And, er,

95
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,880
I've seen a few of the sets.
It looks mental.

96
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,039
All right. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, bro.

97
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,159
Look at this set.
It looks so much better in person.

98
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:19,719
[laughs] Bro, our production.
We keep going up, bro.

99
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:20,640
Come on.

100
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,800
{\an8}- Brother, how you doing?
- Welcome on set.

101
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,520
{\an8}You have lost a little bit of weight.

102
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,440
{\an8}- Yeah. Can I play in the charity match?
- No.

103
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,440
{\an8}No, no, but...

104
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,479
{\an8}- Like...
- Being strong.

105
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,880
{\an8}- I've been trying.
- Fair play.

106
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,200
- Thanks, man.
- Jeez. This looks incredible.

107
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,159
Yeah, I know.

108
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:35,400
It looks sick. This looks very sick.

109
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,440
Lovely stuff, mate.

110
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:44,440
This isn't green.
This is a bit bougie, innit. [laughs]

111
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,359
Yeah.

112
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:46,919
We levelled up a little bit. [laughs]

113
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:50,120
Me, Vik, and Tobe are together on
this one. They're collaborative efforts.

114
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,400
It's our most expensive
and largest video ever.

115
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,960
Not too bad. Looks pretty good.

116
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,960
I disagree with what he's saying.

117
00:05:56,719 --> 00:05:59,159
{\an8}Oh. Nice to meet you. [laughs]

118
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,080
{\an8}Nice to meet you, too.
What are we filming for?

119
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,440
{\an8}- Er, this is our doc, right?
- Oh, really?

120
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,840
[Vik] <i>We've always had our eye
on</i> Takeshi's Castle <i>for the longest time.</i>

121
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,760
<i>We grew up watching it as a game show,</i>

122
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,479
<i>and this was the most fun thing
that we could land on</i>

123
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,200
<i>that would kind of mesh
what MrBeast does and what Sidemen is.</i>

124
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,240
<i>So hopefully, it all works out, erm...</i>

125
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,799
Well, thanks for the life story, Vik.
I appreciate that.

126
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:24,000
We're making...
We're making a long-form video, Harry.

127
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,599
- [Simon] My honest opinion.
- [Vik] Go on.

128
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:28,120
I wouldn't have chosen this one.

129
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:30,000
- Fair.
- [laughs]

130
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,359
Well, it was a balance between

131
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:34,359
what can we build without it
costing another hundred grand,

132
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:36,320
and what will be entertaining to watch.

133
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,400
To be fair, this actually cost a lot.
This floor cost like 50 grand.

134
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,159
What? What? This?

135
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,799
- It's all printed, like...
- It's a mat.

136
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:46,960
No, hang on a minute.
I could've print this for half the price.

137
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,919
[Simon] Twenty grand.
He would've hand-drawn it.

138
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:50,280
[Vik] You can do that next time.

139
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,599
[Harry] Oh, I bloody well will.

140
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,760
- Okay. Something like that.
- For 50 grand?

141
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,400
- Forgive me if I'm wrong.
- Fifty grand?

142
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,680
- I can see the seams.
- TP.

143
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,240
It's not even lined up.

144
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,120
Okay, guys, all cameras rolling, please.

145
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,719
[indistinct chattering]

146
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:09,280
Three, two, one, go.

147
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,400
[all screaming]

148
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,440
Awesome. Yes, now.

149
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,400
- [interviewer] Is this, er...
- Round two.

150
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,840
We're doing... We're doing... Sorry.

151
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,359
No. It's all right. It's all right.

152
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:38,239
- I just wanted to cut him off.
- What was your question?

153
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:42,320
I was gonna ask is this how it goes
or is the flow better for you guys?

154
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,960
Oh, no. No, this is... This is always...

155
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,359
- It's always fucking...
- Okay, good.

156
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:47,479
It's always a shit-show.
No. No, mate.

157
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:48,440
[cheering]

158
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,400
[man] Go Sidemen.

159

[Josh] <i>When we started Sidemen Sundays,</i>

160
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,599
<i>they were pretty much always in our house,</i>

161

<i>and there may have not even been
a cameraman.</i>

162

<i>Now we have productions

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,159
<i>There's all sorts going on.</i>

167
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:13,919
- [man 1] Ooh!
- [man 2] Oh!

168
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,359
[man 3] There's a big hole.

169
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,799
So now it feels like
it's a fully-fledged production

170
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,080
where before it was kids with cameras.

171
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:31,960
{\an8}[woman] Tobi, eight. Take two.

172
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,520
See that's so surreal.

173
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,280
I used to fake that as a kid, like,
emulate what I see on TV

174
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,880
and now it's happening. Fuck.

175
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,280
[laughs] Mum, I made it. [laughs]

176
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,920
[Josh] <i>The core Sidemen members
is me and Tobi who went to school together</i>

177
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,800
<i>and then you have JJ and Simon
who went to school together.</i>

178
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,480
<i>Me and JJ were friends through YouTube.</i>

179
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,560
{\an8}Funnily enough,
I was beating KSI at one point. [laughs]

180
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,000
{\an8}I've got something different.

181
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,040
{\an8}We're doing a set-up video
for the first time ever.

182
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,959
{\an8}[JJ] <i>Josh was one of the first
OG YouTubers.</i>

183
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:11,800
{\an8}<i>He was getting crazy views,
and, yeah, he was seen as that guy.</i>

184
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,360
{\an8}<i>He was the person I looked up to.</i>

185
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,439
{\an8}I was like, "Whoa,
it's Josh, like Zerkaa HD."

186
00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:18,400
{\an8}<i>Hey, what?
Why's he taking that down? No.</i>

187
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,439
{\an8}- Help.
- No. No.

188
00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:23,000
{\an8}[Tobi] <i>Me and Josh
used to play FIFA together.</i>

189
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,600
<i>He was, like, top 200 in the world.</i>

190
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,439
<i>The numbers were astronomical
for that time.</i>

191
00:09:28,439 --> 00:09:32,439
{\an8}100,000 people watching your stuff.
It was mind-blowing.

192
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:36,439
{\an8}[Simon] <i>I heard of YouTube so late,
and it was because of JJ.</i>

193
00:09:36,439 --> 00:09:40,439
{\an8}Word kind of got around
that he was posting videos,

194
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:42,480
{\an8}but no one could really believe it,

195
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,439
{\an8}'cause at school he was, you know,
this very quiet, shy, reserved guy.

196
00:09:47,439 --> 00:09:48,520
<i>Then you'd go on YouTube...</i>

197
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,480
[screams]

198
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,480
<i>He's there going</i> [speaks indistinctly]

199
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,199
It was just surreal to see.

200
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:59,600
- Grade Five, motherfucker.
- [laughs]

201
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
[JJ] <i>I met Simon through school.</i>

202
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,319
In Year 7, we hated each other.
We would always be fighting.

203
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:11,600
Then for some reason, in Year 8 onwards
we just were cool. [laughs]

204
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,680
<i>We forgot about everything,
and we were bless.</i>

205
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,640
[Josh] <i>Ethan comes into that story,
this was, like, 2012</i>

206
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,319
<i>and on my birthday
I was watching Twitch streams,</i>

207
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:24,480
{\an8}<i>and he was streaming FIFA and enjoying it.</i>

208
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,920
{\an8}<i>You could tell like,
"Oh, he's, like, a London lad."</i>

209
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,560
{\an8}[cheering]

210
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,560
<i>It was good vibes, good fun. He's fun.</i>

211
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,079
<i>I got on with well very quickly.</i>

212
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:35,520
There's a lot of, like,
common interests we had.

213
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,520
{\an8}People didn't care about
how many goals we scored in FIFA,

214
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,560
{\an8}they cared about the commentary
and the fun and the jokes.

215
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,480
[laughs]

216
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,520

00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:47,520

218
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,560
[Josh] <i>One night,
something's wrong with YouTube,</i>

219
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,600
<i>and when things go wrong,
me and Vik would talk.</i>

220
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,480
But at the time, I was
in another Skype call with the other boys.

221
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,520
And we were chatting about it,
and Vik was chatting to me, personally.

222
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,520
So I was like,
"Oh, Vik, just come in the call."

223
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,560
{\an8}It's bizarre when you think
you can pinpoint individual sentences

224
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,760
{\an8}that changed the course
of the next ten years of all of our lives.

[Vik] <i>Harry joined the Sidemen
because he was blowing up crazily.</i>

226
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,760
[laughing and cheering]

227
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,199
{\an8}Ah.

228
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:23,000
{\an8}<i>He was a superstar before the Sidemen.</i>

229
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,719
{\an8}[Vik] <i>He was the young FIFA guy
that made his own comment.</i>

230
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:31,760
{\an8}Oh, my fucking... What the fuck! I am done!

231
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,880
{\an8}Oh, shit! Oh, that's properly fucked.

232
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,600
{\an8}My unique selling point
was that I was really bad at the game,

233
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,560
{\an8}but I enjoyed
the whole video-making process.

234
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,560
He came and he stuck and, erm,

235
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,560
he's like, sort of,
forever been under the wing.

236
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,640
{\an8}<i>At the end of the day,
we were just friends.</i>

237
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,360
{\an8}People ended up connecting with us
'cause of our connection on screens.

238
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,160
It's quite cute, really. [laughs]

239
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:58,120
[Bradley] <i>The first Sidemen house
is a fun one.</i>

240
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,560
<i>It's just of me, Simon, Vik and JJ.</i>

241
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,520
And from the get-go the attitude was,

242
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,520
"We're here. We're working.
We're going for it."

243
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,079
- Kitchen! Fridge!
- [clattering]

244
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:11,839
- Zebra in a box.
- Hello.

245
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,079
The first Sidemen house was known by many
as the factory.

246
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:19,199
And believe me, that was...

247
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:23,400
that was an assembly line of content
all hours of the day.

248
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,240
<i>We'd eat dinner, film, finish filming,</i>

249
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,480
<i>go downstairs,
film something else in the kitchen,</i>

250
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,640
<i>wake up, edit, edit, edit.</i>

251
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,079
<i>And then go back into that same routine
every day.</i>

252
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,760
{\an8}These guys are sitting in every day
playing video games.

253
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,760
{\an8}I just couldn't believe what I was seeing.

254
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,640
{\an8}Like these guys continuously working.

255
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:45,640
{\an8}And, yeah, I... Look, I don't think
it is healthy to work as much as they did.

256
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:52,280
<i>These guys are confined in their rooms,
sitting, playing video games non-stop.</i>

257
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,800
But you could argue
like that was the difference maker

258
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,839
between them being where they are now
and... and maybe a different outcome.

259
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:01,319
[Harry] <i>You boys have no life!
You don't do anything!</i>

260

<i>You sit in your bedrooms
all day, getting old!</i>

261
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:06,959
<i>Your... your lives withering away!</i>

262
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,839
<i>What are you doing with your...
go do something!</i>

263
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,400
<i>Why? Why? You can't just stare at a screen
till you're 60?</i>

264
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,959
<i>Live! Experience the life!
Visit a country. Do something.</i>

265
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,520

I didn't see it as a job.</i>

269
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:31,599
<i>I was, literally, posting every day
because I wanted to.</i>

270
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:35,640
<i>I'm literally living with my best mates,
and everything I'm doing is fun.</i>

271
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,599
<i>So why not just do that all the time?</i>

272
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:42,160
Best episode is definitely the one with,
er, the-- [yelps]

273
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:51,000
What the fuck? For fuck's sake. [laughs]

274
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,839
Do what? [laughs]

275
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:57,319
[screams] Oh, shit. Oh. Ah. Ah.

276
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,480
It was relentless. It didn't stop.
But everything was paying off so well

277
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,120
and the space was, compared to now,
it was so unsaturated,

278
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,280
{\an8}<i>that the more content we could make,
the more views we were gonna get.</i>

279
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,240
<i>There was no level of quality</i>

280

<i>that had hit the platform
in the same way that it has now.</i>

281
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,040
So, for us, it was a win-win-win.

282
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,319
[Rechtman] <i>It was fascinating
to be part of YouTube early on</i>

283
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:29,959
{\an8}and seeing those talented young people
creating the future back then.

284
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:32,479
{\an8}And many people didn't understand,
including myself.

285
00:14:32,479 --> 00:14:33,800
{\an8}It was unique.

286
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,920
<i>It's seldom you have that feeling.</i>

287
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,599
<i>When something is created
that is beyond those people creating it,</i>

288
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:44,439
they didn't even understand
what they were creating.

[Whittock] <i>The main difference
between YouTube</i>

<i>and the traditional media companies,</i>

291
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,000
{\an8}it's an issue of control and gatekeeping.

292
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,760
{\an8}So the broadcasters would always,
in the past,

293
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,599
<i>have been the people who would decide
who's on TV,</i>

<i>what they're doing on TV.</i>

295
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,240
<i>YouTube completely turned that
on its head.</i>

296
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,560
It effectively said, there's no barriers
for you to get your content out there.

297
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,479
You can do what you like.

298

<i>There's not gonna be a producer

<i>telling you exactly how to do that.</i>

300
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,120
That's where things have been interesting

{\an8}[Josh] <i>It was like a perfect storm really</i>

{\an8}<i>It was exciting,

304
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,599
But when you're on it, it's so natural.

305
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:32,199
You could be on the fastest setting,

306
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:34,240

322
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,560
I... sometimes have panic attacks
in the shower 'cause of fear of death.

323
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,719
[Josh] <i>My anxiety,
it's a mixture of things.</i>

324
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:38,719
<i>It makes me very hyper-aware
of everything.</i>

325
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:40,760
<i>I'm very calculated in what I do.</i>

326
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,719
<i>But that doesn't come because I want to.
It comes 'cause of how I think.</i>

327
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:45,400
It works for me,

328
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,280
but, obviously, it's not an ideal thing
to be doing I guess.

329
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,240
It's weird though, right?

330
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,040
Like, it's a weird discussion
'cause obviously like,

331
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,400
"Should I feel bad about that?
Is it a good thing?"

332
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,120
I... I'm very anxious,
so it made me very good at work.

333
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:14,520
<i>The way that I've always dealt with things
is... was through gaming.</i>

334
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,200
<i>It's like a whole world
you can go and escape in.</i>

335
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,319
And the greatest example that I use
is the reason why I'm here today

336
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,399
is because, when I was younger,
my parents got divorced

337
00:17:23,399 --> 00:17:26,520
<i>and when there was arguments going on
or stuff going on,</i>

338
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,879
<i>sat in my room,
played</i> Call of Duty <i>all night</i>

339
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,720
{\an8}<i>which led me to go down the path
of playing</i> Call of Duty <i>competitively,</i>

340
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,280
<i>which then led me to be a YouTuber
which is where I am today.</i>

341
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,159
So, in the weirdest way possible,

342
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,919
those arguments and my parents
breaking up,

343
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:44,919
was one of the best things that happened.

344
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,080
- [Josh] <i>It's mental.</i>
- [man] <i>It is insane, innit.</i> [laughs]

345
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,480
- Actually insane.
- Got a little inside theatre.

346
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,040
Bro's got a cinema in his house.

347
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,399
- This the master bedroom?
- [man] Yes.

348
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,960
[woman] So if you want tonight, er,
press the button, put the shades down.

349
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,919
[Josh] <i>It's actually scary.
I know everywhere here way too well.</i>

350
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,280
[interviewer] You've picked the locations
'cause of GTA?

351
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,240
Yeah.

352
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,680
Do you know how sad it is
that I know GTA road names off by heart?

353
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,080
- [interviewer] That's pretty--
- Like the whole city. It's fucked up.

354
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,159
I tried to catch the spares,
so I don't catch nothing.

355
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,480
- Harry, anything?
- I'm ready to have a great day.

356
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,000
All right, guys, gather up.

357
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,320
Maybe, just saying,
we just get the shot and then

358
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,639
we'll just cheat it in the edit,
so it looks like at the same time.

359
00:18:40,639 --> 00:18:42,600
- Ready?
- All right. Let's get it.

360
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,360
[laughs]

361
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,480
- Welcome to LA, boys.
- [cheering]

362
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,040
[JJ] <i>This time, we're in America.</i>

363
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,320
<i>Basically, we're trying to get
that MrBeast American audience.</i>

364
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,040
<i>I feel like we've had everything but that.</i>

365
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,720
<i>We've definitely conquered the UK.
We've smashed it in Europe.</i>

366
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,440
<i>We, kind of, just need
that American audience</i>

367
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,679
<i>and this is a great way to do it,
us being out here,</i>

368
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:09,360
<i>showing, you know,
the love that we have for America</i>

369
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,720
<i>and also making good videos out here.</i>

370
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,040
I'm excited, man. I feel like
this is gonna take us to the next level.

371
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,280
It's finally here.

372
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,879
- [laughing]
- [indistinct chattering]

373
00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:20,879
{\an8}- Okay can you... bro.
- [laughs]

374
00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:23,639
{\an8}- You don't know what we're doing.
- What do you mean?

375
00:19:23,639 --> 00:19:25,440
{\an8}Like we don't know what we're...
what this is?

376
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,879
{\an8}Oh, what you do?
Walk up, say your name, your age.

377
00:19:28,879 --> 00:19:30,600
Ten shakes, ten guys.

378
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,720
- Do we have to make up the lines?
- Yeah.

379
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,240
- I've gotta get to work, bro.
- Why'd you have to work?

380
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,520
- I...
- What do you mean?

381
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,000
I don't have any lines, dude.

382
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,800
[Tobi] <i>The US trip was something.
We filmed like three videos out there.</i>

383
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,440
Er, I'm KSI, 29 and, er...

384
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,200
- Okay.
- [whooping]

385
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,360
Spent something around
half a million dollars on that trip.

386
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,720
So there's a lot of money
going into these projects

387
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,440
<i>which is, in return,
a lot of pressure to deliver.</i>

388
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,080
It'd be in Hollywood.
It'd be near our hotel.

389
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,240
Mate, and also,
the quicker you get stuff done,

390
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,200
the less traffic there'll be coming back
from Venice Beach to Hollywood.

391
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,280
All right.

392
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,720
So just make sure
they just don't go mope about...

393
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,280
Yeah, that's good.
That's good content, anyway. All right.

394
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,840
Er, I'm just tired. [laughs]

395
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,520
- [Josh] No one's had any sleep.
- No one's had sleep.

396
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,639
It was all a bit like chaotic and...
and crazy.

397
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:23,879
It's a ropey one. It's, er,
a lot of pressure on this video.

398
00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:26,480
And you think, "Oh, yeah.
LA's a great place to film."

399
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,080
Erm, turns out it's not.

400
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,159
America is a, sort of, awkward place
to film 'cause they all know.

401
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:35,600
They get it. They understand filming,
so like, "Right. You guys earn money.

402
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,040
We will charge you this much, use this."

403
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,440
And it's just ridiculous rates
all the time.

404
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,360
Whatever happens, you roll
with the punches and make it work.

405
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,360
That's what we do.

406
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,960
We make stuff work
regardless of the circumstances.

407
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,159
[Zeitoune] <i>A lot of people underestimate</i>

408
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:53,960
<i>how hard it is to be successful
as a creator.</i>

409
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,520
<i>And I get really frustrated with
how dismissive people are of creators</i>

410
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,760
{\an8}thinking, "Oh, it's easy."

411
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,200
{\an8}They're in their bedroom,
and they just talk nonsense.

412
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,000
{\an8}That is rubbish.

413
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
{\an8}It is so hard to get cut-through,
particularly on a platform like YouTube

414
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,040
<i>where there are 600 hours uploaded
every minute.</i>

415
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,360
I do think it's good. How are you?
Jump in the middle.

416
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,919
Okay.

417
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,520
- Thank you, man.
- Thank you, guys. Thank you.

418
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,159
[indistinct chattering]

419
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,320
Nice to meet you guys.

420
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,639
Oh, my God.
I don't wanna make you feel old,

421
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:37,440
but back when I was younger, dude,
I still watch y'all today.

422
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,840
- I'm kind of shaky, so...
- Thank you very much.

423
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,919
[laughs] You know, thank you. Thank you.

[Simon] <i>Fans feel like they know us better
than traditional celebrities</i>

425
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,960
<i>'cause they are seeing us as us.</i>

That's it.

431
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,040
- How are you? Feeling good?
- Good.

432
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,480
Good man. Good chilling.

433
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,080
- Yeah. Can I get a picture?
- Of course you can, brother.

434
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,360
- Bet you didn't expect to see me.
- Yeah. Nope!

435
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,800
- [laughs]
- Honest... Honestly no.

436
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,639
- You filming YouTube?
- Yeah, bro. We're doing a road trip.

437
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,280
- I'm in the middle of the desert, bro...
- And someone's clicked you.

438
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,800
That's so crazy, man.

439
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,480
You lot are crazy.
I fucking love you lot so much, man.

This is not safe.

Ah.

443
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,080
Hello, everyone.

444
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:48,000
Our first event as the Sidemen Insomnia
was a real eye-opener.

445
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,960
It legitimised what we did.

446
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:56,040
It turned those numbers and those comments
into real faces, real people.

447
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,720
<i>It really started to make us understand
the power of the Sidemen brand,</i>

448
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,320
more so than we did up until that point.

449
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:08,000
[announcer] The one, the only the Sidemen.
Sidemen, everyone. Whoo!

[cheering and shouting]

452
00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:30,200
That was the first time, I think,
we realised that it was like a big deal.

453
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,720
<i>Felt really weird
'cause we do everything online</i>

454

<i>and then you go to this place
and you're meeting these people.</i>

455
00:23:35,879 --> 00:23:37,480
<i>It was really weird.</i>

456
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,120
<i>And back then, that was mental.</i>

{\an8}This is... this is how humble
their background was, right?

460
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,919
{\an8}They literally had printed some t-shirts
and hoodies, took them to this event

[Rechtman] <i>In the early days,</i>

469
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:26,919
monetisation made it possible
to create this industry.

I was a broke-ass uni student, right?
I was living off of Subway points.

471
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,800
I promise you, like my Subway card
was the most valuable thing in my wallet.

472
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,879
When I'm seeing that the stuff
that I'm doing on YouTube

473
00:24:36,879 --> 00:24:39,399
has the potential to get me some money

474
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:43,399
that I can use to pay off these expenses
that I have while I'm studying,

475

I'm like, "Okay, cool.
That is a motivating factor."

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,960
the more money I get in my bank
at the end of the month.

479
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,280
The more validation this has,

480
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,800
the more cool things
that I can buy and do."

481
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,639
You uploaded these videos
on a weekly basis,

482
00:25:01,639 --> 00:25:03,240
and you got more and more audience,

483
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,520
and suddenly, the algorithm recognise you

484
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,600
and you start making money on advertising
that YouTube was selling.

485
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,760
And the big ones were making millions.

486
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,480

[Harry] <i>I got a bloody Lambo
when I was like 18</i>

488
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:21,280
<i>'cause I was making decent money
back then.</i>

489
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,679
<i>Obviously a horrendous
and fiscally irresponsible idea</i>

490
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:27,120
because the insurance itself
cost more than the car.

491
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,080
Look what I've done already.

492
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,080
<i>It was ridiculous.</i>

493
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,960
I bought a pair of shoes that was $30,000.

494
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,919
- Ah!
- [man] Mate.

495
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:38,840
{\an8}$35,000.

496
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,840
Ta-da.

497
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,040
<i>Bought a gold PS5.</i>

498
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,120
[woman] Looks like you're holding a baby.

499
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,040
- No. I'd take way more care with this.
- [laughs]

500
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,600
Baby ain't worth $8,000.

501
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,240
Oh. Whoa. [laughs]

502
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:58,360
[JJ] <i>Buying a Lamborghini
and then colouring it purple Tron</i>

503
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,240
<i>even having, like,
Need For Speed LED lights underneath.</i>

504
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,159
<i>I mean it looked cool as fuck
but the amount of attention that I got...</i>

505
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,080
[laughs] was incredible.

506
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,159
[engine roaring]

507
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,040
When I was younger, I'd always be like,
"I need this amount of money."

508
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,760
And when I've got this amount of money,
I can just stop doing YouTube

509
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,040
and just live my life and travel and...

510
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,560
because that's really what I wanna do.
I wanna have fun and do stuff.

511
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,919
<i>But then I realised,
I should really be saving</i>

512
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:31,280
<i>in case I've got like a family
in the future.</i>

513
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,919
<i>And I wanna like put my money
to a good cause</i>

514
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,240
<i>and like do like actual
good stuff with it.</i>

515
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,360
[Tobi] <i>Harry is unapologetically himself.
And he's just so weird.</i>

516
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,720
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- [bleep]

517
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,919
<i>- He's so weird.</i>
- [laughter]

518
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:53,439
But normal at the same time.

519
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:55,000
<i>People know he's outrageous.</i>

520
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,600
<i>People know he says outrageous things.
He's free to be that.</i>

521
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,520
Ah.

522
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,600
[exhales]

523
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,480
- [yelps]
- Ooh.

524
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,240
<i>So what this intro was meant to be</i>

525
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,159
<i>was me hitting the bucket of drinks
all over my mum.</i>

526
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,159
<i>But instead...</i>

527
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,600
[yelps]

528
00:27:22,879 --> 00:27:25,320
[Harry] <i>I was really lucky
to grow up in Guernsey</i>

529
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,439
<i>because it's just like the perfect little
adventure playground for a kid.</i>

530
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:33,800
<i>I used to build like treehouses and stuff.
I used to just, I don't know, muck about.</i>

531
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,960
<i>I was bit of a weird kid</i>

532
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,840
so I didn't have a load of friends
when I was growing up there

533
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,480
but I think being the weird kid
pushed me into doing YouTube.

534
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,399
<i>As soon as YouTube was like a half-thing
like people were posting, I was on there.</i>

535
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:47,520
<i>And I know a lot of the guys
are OGs on YouTube,</i>

536
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,080
<i>but I promise you I wasn't far behind</i>

537
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,919
<i>because I was posting, like...
not even like proper videos,</i>

538
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,960
<i>Just like me editing
like special effects of stuff.</i>

539
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,800
{\an8}Hey, guys.
This is gonna be a quick... [sputtering]

540
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,280
{\an8}unedited vlog...

541
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,399
{\an8}For Adam on your PC
for his Christmas collab video, erm,

542
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:05,960
{\an8}pretty much all I have to say is
Merry Christmas.

543
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,000
{\an8}I hope you get all the presents you want.

544
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
{\an8}And if you don't, then shoot Santa.

545
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:13,199
[Randolph] <i>Harry Stevens
on camera really. He's very lovable.</i>

546
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:14,639
Now we're talking.

547
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:18,199
<i>Like a Golden retriever, like a Labrador.
Like that type of energy.</i>

548
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:20,600
<i>He's just cuddly, you know?
So he's a great guy.</i>

549
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,840
{\an8}Very hard worker as well.

550
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,800
{\an8}People think maybe...
they would think that he's, like, lazy

551
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,600
{\an8}'cause he doesn't post all the time
but he's not.

552
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,280
{\an8}<i>When he sets out to do something,</i>

553
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,639
{\an8}<i>he does it to the best of his ability,
and he creates the best content.</i>

554
00:28:33,439 --> 00:28:37,520
{\an8}A hard work ethic is really the glue
that binds the seven of them together.

555
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,600
{\an8}The fact that they keep doing it

556
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,159
{\an8}with such a smile on their face,
loving what they do,

557
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,439
is a testament to their friendship
but also that work ethic

558
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:48,760
<i>which really has enabled them
to get to this position.</i>

559
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,000
<i>'cause not many people are here
after ten years,</i>

560
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,399
more relevant than ever
and growing at a pace

561
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,720
that you would assume this was
their first year, not their tenth.

562
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,639
[Simon] What do you think motivates us
to keep going?

563
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:02,280
Legacy.

564
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,679
- I mean for me it's always legacy, but--
- [Vik] Ego.

565
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:07,919
I think deep down we've worked so hard
to get to the top that...

566
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,959
- We don't wanna let it go.
- We can't let go now.

567
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:11,280
[Vik] Don't wanna be washed.

568
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,240
That's the same reason
why I assume you still post videos

569
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,879
'cause you could stop tomorrow,

570
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,480
- and you would slowly like--
- He has.

571
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,480
- [laughter]
- [Vik] He stopped two years ago.

572
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,600
- Sidemen.
- No. But you could stop Sidemen.

573
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,280
- You could stop Sidemen. You could chill.
- I'm down for that. That's a great plan.

574
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,360
So why don't you leave?

575
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,639
He's like, "Can't wait
for this thing to end."

576
00:29:28,639 --> 00:29:30,240
Yeah. I think... I think I'm close.

577
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,480
- [laughs]
- I think I'm... I think I'm close.

578
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,560
We all laugh when he says it. Yeah...

579
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,159
No. I always hear the...
you can hear the truth in his voice.

580
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:38,520
The truth in it every time.

581
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,919
- But like what is...
- It gets stronger every time as well.

582
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:44,639
What keeps you going
from stopping tomorrow?

583
00:29:44,639 --> 00:29:46,240
Because I enjoy it still.

584
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,560
I enjoy, er, I enjoy it.

585
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,399
But also I enjoy the... It's... this stuff.

586
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,240
[laughter]

587
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,879
This is like... and like the shoots...
the shoots I enjoy, it's just...

588
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:59,679
It's everything
where you are technically in charge.

589
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,360
I guess so. Yeah.

590
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,639
If this was to come to a vote,
you would've said no.

591
00:30:03,639 --> 00:30:04,959
- What do you mean?
- Like this.

592
00:30:04,959 --> 00:30:07,240
- To do this whole piece.
- You'd give a no, innit?

593
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,879
You're all lovely people, but yeah.

594
00:30:08,879 --> 00:30:11,000
[laughter]

595
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,720
- It's not... yeah. I don't know.
- It's fair.

596
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,959
What? So what are you guys gonna...

597
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:15,919
What's your plan?

598
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,800
- So I see YouTube as the core, the heart.
- [Simon] The foundation.

599
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,679
- Without YouTube... everything dies.
- [Tobi] That's so smart, man.

600
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:24,199
So I wouldn't be able to box,

601
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:26,840
I wouldn't be able to do music
without YouTube.

602
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,320
So I always feel like
I have to post content there

603
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,280
to make sure everything else thrives.

00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,480
everyone in the Sidemen and troops
and everyone like that just goes, "No."

640
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,719
And we fear. But in my heart,
I'm just like I know he wins.

641
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,679
Stop boxing. We have videos to make, JJ.

642
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,520
Fuck.

643
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,480
We've got videos to make,

644
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,480
and you're doing camp for six weeks
at a time. Fuck.

645
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,399
[JJ] <i>Life was interesting
with me and my family.</i>

646
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:27,439
<i>You know we weren't super rich.</i>

647
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:31,080
Both my parents were, I guess, immigrants.

648
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,760
<i>They came over from Nigeria</i>

649
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,199
<i>and just put a lot of work
into me and my bro.</i>

650
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:42,399
- [air horn honking]
- Get out.

651
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,120
Hey, guys. Olajide BT,

652
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,080
and today I'm doing a Q&A Sunday
with my bro. Say "hi."

653
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:51,760
You're such an idiot.

654
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,600
My earliest memory of Deji
was when he... [laughs]

655
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,879
he couldn't... [laughs]
couldn't hold his piss

656
00:33:58,879 --> 00:34:01,320
<i>and my mum gave him a bottle.</i>

657
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,000
<i>So he tried peeing in a bottle
and his dick fell out,</i>

658
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,040
<i>and he just starting pissing all over me.</i>

659
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,520
Yeah, I was, that was an experience.
[laughs]

660
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,719
[Randolph] <i>JJ went from this super nerdy,
like, super shy guy</i>

661
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,639
to one of the most famous people
in the country maybe in the world.

662
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,360
<i>You know boxer, rapper,
and also he carried the entire UK scene.</i>

663
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,480
The UK would not be like this
without JJ on YouTube for sure.

664
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,080
Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

665
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,480
JJ is... he's a funny character.

666
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,440
[shouting]

667
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,719
[Tobi] <i>He's the most egotistical person
and the most humble person simultaneously.</i>

668
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,560
What's up, bro? [laughs]

669
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,400
And when that camera is on,
his character is in full flow.

670
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,520
So, everything that you know about JJ

671
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,759
is elevated probably
like five times minimum.

672
00:34:45,759 --> 00:34:49,839
- Oh, my God! [screams]
- Open the window.

673
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,440
No! There's a bug, bro!
Ah! Get it... get it out, bro.

674
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,960
I'm-a die. I'm-a die. I'm-a die, bro.

675
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,880
Oh, no. Get out! Ah, shit! Shit!

676
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,040
I think my parents' work ethic
is definitely a huge reason

677
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,680
why I'm so successful.

678
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,200
I'm just always grinding.

679
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,040
Like I always have said
that I'm not talented.

680
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,520
I'm just a person
that just works extremely hard.

681
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,880
There's a saying where

682
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,880
if you put 10,000 hours into something
you become a master at it.

683
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,880
And you know I've definitely
had 10,000 hours on YouTube

684
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,759
and that's why I'm in the position I'm in.

691
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:47,080
<i>In 2017, I definitely felt like,
as a YouTuber</i>

692
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:51,279
there was just no way
you could do music properly.

693
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:53,960
<i>People struggled to differentiate</i>

694
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:58,960
between a musician putting out,
you know, heartfelt music

695
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,960
and music that was important to you,

696
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,600
and then also a YouTuber
who's able to make funny random videos.

697
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,440
<i>♪ La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini ♪</i>

698

<i>♪ Ride so quick

699
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:14,880
So I was kind of battling with that aspect

700
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:21,440
and decided I wanted to become a musician
and really focus on music.

701
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:34,520
[exhales] Er... [clears throat]

702
00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:41,839
Obviously this is, er...
this is not an easy, er...

703
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,960
this is not an easy video to make.

704
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:50,200
I am no longer with the Sidemen.

705
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,759
I think I was just on my computer,
and it came up.

706
00:36:52,759 --> 00:36:55,319
And then the group chat
started popping off like,

707
00:36:55,319 --> 00:36:57,880
"What's going on, JJ?
Why, er, what is this video?

708
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,720
"Like are you serious? Are you not?"

709
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,279
[JJ] <i>Obviously, I love the guys.</i>

710
00:37:01,279 --> 00:37:03,120
Guys will always be in my heart.

711
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,160
But, er, you know,
all good things come to an end I guess.

712
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,920
JJ is a very trusting guy.

713
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,120
And I know that he had countless people
telling him to leave Sidemen,

714
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,319
"Come to LA. You can be way bigger."
Blah, blah, blah.

715
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:19,560
Selling him like a proper dream.

716
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,440
So it was a nervous time for all of us
in terms of would he... would he leave?

717
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,600
Why I'm leaving Sidemen? Er...

718
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,920
mainly because of Ethan.

719
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,480
I'd say he was the main reason
I'm leaving.

720
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,480
Can't stand him.

721
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:35,680
I could see it coming

722
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,279
because it makes sense
why he singled me out

723
00:37:39,279 --> 00:37:43,160
because I'm an easy target
in the sense of like,

724
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,359
I dish it out to everyone, anyway.

725
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:50,240
At that point that was the, the low point
in the Sidemen arc, I would say.

726
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,920
We were starting to make videos
less together.

727
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,080
JJ was taking his music more seriously.

728
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,560
{\an8}And it could've been the point
everything fizzled out.

729
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,640
{\an8}<i>♪ Yeah

730
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,359

731

735
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,880
[laughs]

736
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,520
I woke up in bed
with my girlfriend at the time, who said,

737
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,720
"Hey, have you seen
what JJ's just uploaded?"

738
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,120
So I wake up like this.

739
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:29,400
I'm watching it on my phone thinking,
"What on earth's happening?"

740
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,680
{\an8}<i>I do have some sort of like pride
in myself a little bit like,</i>

741
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,359
{\an8}<i>"I will do something."</i> [laughs]

742
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,640
I will perform to what you want me to
if you think I'm not going to

743
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,480
'cause I bet he didn't expect me to have
a whole thing out 24 hours later.

744
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,080
And that's what I really liked about it,
him releasing that

745
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,279
because you can tell by the songs,

746
00:38:48,279 --> 00:38:51,279
music's not my forte in the slightest,
right? [laughs]

747
00:38:51,279 --> 00:38:54,640
<i>But the fact that he might wake up
and go on his phone and go,</i>

748
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,359
<i>"Really? Like Ethan did that?"</i>

749
00:38:56,359 --> 00:38:58,400
That's the... that was the W for me.

750
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,240
{\an8}[laughs]

751
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,319
{\an8}What the fuck is this shit?
Man, you know I've gotta react to this.

752
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,600

00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,600
{\an8}Never made a diss?
What the fuck is this then?

758
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,440
{\an8}"Behzinga Drama,
KSI and Ricegum diss track."

759
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,440
{\an8}It's like... [laughs]

760
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,240
The diss track thing. My eyes lit up,
like it was a perfect opportunity.

761
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,880
Like I'd always liked doing like...

762
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,880
we used to in these Skype calls
we used to have.

763
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,920
We used to just sit there
and do rap battles.

764
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,080
So we'd sync up a beat.

765
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,680
We'd all be hearing,
and we'd just like rap at each other,

766
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,440
which I always really enjoyed.

767
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,759
As soon as I figured out
diss tracks were happening,

768
00:39:57,759 --> 00:39:59,680
I was like,
"I could do a diss track here."

769
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,080
It's the best diss track I've ever heard.

770
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,600
The first time I heard of the Sidemen

771
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:30,759
{\an8}was actually Harry's diss track against JJ

772
00:40:30,759 --> 00:40:32,640
<i>'cause we were beefing at the time,</i>

773
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,160
and Harry made the diss track.
I thought it was awesome.

774
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:50,440
When I first heard Harry's diss track,
I was pissed because he went in,

775
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,560
and I was like,
"Bro, what the fuck are you doing?"

776
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:57,560
<i>I was in America at the time,
and I was like so angry.</i>

777
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:01,920
So I was like, "All right. Calm, bless.
Like we're gonna go down this route."

778
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,359
And then that's when I decided
to make "Little Boy". [laughs]

779
00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:20,160
{\an8}You know what, that's probably...

780
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,759
{\an8}that's one of the first times JJ
actually started to shine as like raw.

781
00:41:23,759 --> 00:41:26,200
{\an8}His words and his music,
is actually hitting, you know?

782
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,160
It's hitting like...

783
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,640
Even though it was comical, it was fun,
it was just in jest,

784
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,799
it actually started to let them
shine through

785
00:41:31,799 --> 00:41:33,960
as like, "We're making music, you know?"

786
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,680
Like, "We're dissing, saying things,

787
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,720
hitting with music,
thinking about what we do,

788
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,799
thinking about the beat,
the beat switch, the cut-outs, the video."

789
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:56,279
[Jme] <i>If there was no diss tracks,</i>

790
00:41:56,279 --> 00:41:59,799
<i>JJ might not have taken his music
as seriously as he's taking it now.</i>

791
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,319
That was a sick time. Can't be done again.

792
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,480
{\an8}You know what? I was surprised
to hear Simon spit that quick.

793
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,520
{\an8}He done a sick job.

794
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:28,440
{\an8}And that video, we filmed it in, like,
an evening at some petrol station

795
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,759
and then I had the edit up
ready the next day.

796
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:34,480
And I remember the moment
of when he clicked the "upload" button.

797
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,640
And then as soon as you hit refresh to see
how many views you've got. It said 40,000.

798
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,200
I'm not kidding.
It was literally 30 seconds.

799
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,640
That's insane.

800
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:48,440
I think it was just a good way
that we could all have fun, get views,

801
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:52,160
and that's about it really, to be honest.
But then it ended up spiralling.

802
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,839
Okay. "You're a korma, I'm a vindaloo.

803
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:01,640
When you're a bad boy,
Yinka grabs the shoe." [laughs]

804
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,799
"While you're out trying to fuck groupies,

805
00:43:03,799 --> 00:43:08,560
I got your mum twerking
for my rupees." [laughs]

806
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,960
<i>It's impossible to put a value</i>

807
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,520
<i>on how lucrative the diss tracks
ended up being</i>

808
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,240
<i>by the complete coincidence
that we fell into them.</i>

809
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,799
But I would say
on the diss track videos alone,

810
00:43:19,799 --> 00:43:23,319
it was probably
half-a-million pounds' worth of revenue.

811
00:43:23,319 --> 00:43:24,759
And then if you talk about

812
00:43:24,759 --> 00:43:27,680
how much viewership and attention
it drove towards us,

813
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,560
several times that in the long run.

814
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,839
{\an8}<i>It rallied all of these fans.</i>

815
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:35,040
{\an8}<i>It created this huge content opportunity</i>

816
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,120
<i>that actually made the Sidemen bigger
than it had ever been.</i>

817
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,240
[JJ] <i>Ultimately, I'm still in the Sidemen
because they're my boys.</i>

818
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:50,319
Yeah I know it's hard work making,
you know, my dreams come true

819
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:54,359
<i>as well as doing stuff with the Sidemen
and making our dreams together come true</i>

820
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:58,960
<i>but it's what I'm willing to do
to make sure me and them are good.</i>

821
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,279
Yeah. Just 'cause they're my boys, man.
[laughs]

822
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,720
[Josh] <i>With the cheap
versus expensive videos,</i>

823
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,120
<i>it becomes very personal</i>

824
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,400
<i>'cause it's very hard to see past the fact
that one team are having a great time...</i>

825
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,960
[cheering] Oh, this is my holiday.

826
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,560
<i>They've got lots of cool experiences.</i>

827
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,759
Oh, yes.

828
00:44:28,759 --> 00:44:30,160
<i>And you're stuck on the bad team.</i>

829
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,680
Have we got some bug spray?

830
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,400
- That bag.
- I want it. Where is it?

831
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,560
Behind the scenes with the boys,
it turns into like, "What the hell?"

832
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:42,359
[Vik] So literally we've been given
a camping spot

833
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:45,560
that is just riddled with...
with literally stinging nettle.

834
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,799
[Josh] <i>The audience don't wanna see
the bad team have a great time.</i>

835
00:44:48,799 --> 00:44:52,279
They wanna see the bad team suffer
'cause the suffering is the content.

836
00:44:55,879 --> 00:44:59,000
[Ethan] I've more than accepted fate.
We are in a fucking shithole.

837
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,319
We are camping on rock.

838
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:03,520
We have a rock formation
in our fucking tent.

839
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,720
Can we do a hostile takeover
of the other campsite?

840
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,440
Are you eating already?

841
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,400
[Ethan] Fuck off. I'm in my happy space.

842
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:15,000
I'm eating a sausage in a forest.

843
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,600
[Josh] Okay. So we've returned to,
now, the bad team.

844
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,600
Now to get abused and attacked
for making them be on the bad team.

845
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,000
Er, piss off.

846
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,560
[laughs]

847
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,160
- Is he here?
- Yeah, he is here.

848
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,200
Piss off, you fucking big head.

849
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,359
God, what a spot.

850
00:45:32,359 --> 00:45:34,120
Does he want us to reply to him?

851
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,920
Oh, no. You don't look very happy.
This is the worst one you've ever done.

852
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,080
- Why?
- It's awful.

853
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,000
Sit down.

854
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,920
- I got a present for you.
- No, no. Take a seat.

855
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,960
- Oh, it's like a council.
- Yeah. Take a seat.

856
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,040
- Welcome to, er--
- Hang on, two secs.

857
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,240
- Welcome to Team Tent.
- Team Tent? Nice.

858
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,720
Team Tent up in this bitch.

859
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,520
[Josh] <i>I actually went and visited
the, er, bad team</i>

860
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:02,839
and their moods were not... [laughs]
in the greatest of ways.

861
00:46:02,839 --> 00:46:06,640
- Sack these ones off.
- What the fuck is this game?

862
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,200
Ethan as well 'cause at that time,

863
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,640
Ethan hadn't really experienced
being on a good team

864
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,680
<i>so I feel like it's, er,</i>

865
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,920
<i>bottled up frustration had occurred
from being on the bad team.</i>

866
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,560
What does the new card say, er, this is...

867
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:22,440
"Congratulations you've come out on top
from bad to good. Get ready to swap."

868
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:24,920
Oh.

869
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,480
So you're happy now, yeah?

870
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,839
Go nuts, bro.

871
00:46:28,839 --> 00:46:33,040
We've been eating dog food, bro.
We've been through the worst of it.

872
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,839
[Josh] Listen, I'm trying to work
with you.

873
00:46:34,839 --> 00:46:36,400
- But I'll...
- [Josh] One of you come.

874
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,600
We've done the worst.
What's the point in swapping?

875
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,960
- [Josh] Tobi, go.
- Why are you...

876
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,359
How are you... how are you upset
about getting a good deal?

877
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:43,799
No, 'cause it's pointless.

878
00:46:43,799 --> 00:46:45,240
They come here and do everything?

879
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,359
- One person.
- I don't care.

880
00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:48,480
- Bro, just go. Ethan, just go.
- I ain't going.

881
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,440
No. Me and Behz aren't going.

882
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,200
- Vik... No.
- We're in this life. Tobi, go. Tobi, go.

883
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,000
No. This is good.

884
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,080
'Cause look, look, look, you, look get...

885
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,600
They ain't eating the dog food.
They gonna come... listen, I'll get vexed.

886
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,319
They're gonna come here.
They ain't been eating the dog food, bro.

887
00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:04,640
- Just work with him.
- You, go.

888
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,120
- Me and Behz can't go.
- Why is this so hard?

889
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,480
We've done it already!

890
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,240
- What's the point in swapping?
- 'Cause you get... a great night.

891
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,520
We get a great night, but I'm going home!
I'd rather get in the cab and fuck off!

892
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,400
[laughter]

893
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,279
I'm so glad I've seen this footage.
This is amazing.

894
00:47:20,279 --> 00:47:22,279
Yeah, it's funny.
That was my hot-headedness.

895
00:47:22,279 --> 00:47:25,160
- It's fine it got 30 million views.
- You've done well, mate.

896
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,120
Oh, damn.

897
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,799
That's the only one, I think,
I've ever had with you ever.

898
00:47:28,799 --> 00:47:31,480
- What like argument that--
- Yeah, yeah. Like proper argument.

899
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,080
No, no. Let's be honest.
We've fallen out a few times.

900
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,080
- I feel like you're always involved.
- [JJ] Not always.

901
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:40,359
Even if he's not involved,
he gets involved. He loves it.

902
00:47:40,359 --> 00:47:41,759
- We didn't even know.
- I did. I...

903
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:43,400
It would involve you, me, or you.

904
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,600
Yeah, yeah. [exclaims] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

905
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,080
It's us three. Little trifecta.

906
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,200
Harry, have you ever--

907
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,319
No. But I love
watching it from the outside.

908
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,120
- [laughter]
- I love a little bit of that.

909
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,560
He's... he's like a pot stirrer.

910
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:58,080
He's like a pot stirrer. I'm like...
I try and be like... I try and help guys.

911
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,120
Just like a counsellor.

912
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,920
I try and explain and it doesn't work.
Vik does the same. Tobi does the same.

913
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,759
- He just sits there and goes, "Ooh."
- [laughs]

914
00:48:05,759 --> 00:48:09,680
We're seven very different personalities
but somehow it all just works naturally.

915
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,720
{\an8}"Your nose looks like
it's on a snapchat filter 24/7." [laughs]

916
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,920
{\an8}[laughter]

917
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,759
{\an8}"Hey, Slender,
how comes you have cum in your hair?"

918
00:48:29,759 --> 00:48:33,120
{\an8}[laughter]

919
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,279
{\an8}The interesting part
of being on social media

920
00:48:36,279 --> 00:48:42,040
{\an8}is that you have an ability to be able
to see and respond very quickly.

921
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:48,040
But with that, trolling and mental health
has become a real topic of conversation.

922
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,960
{\an8}"What is the difference
between Vikkstar and a tree?

923
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,480
{\an8}"Nothing. They're both hollow
on the inside and brown on the outside."

924
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,759
{\an8}[laughter]

925

{\an8}[Ravindran] <i>Instant feedback
can be really toxic.</i>

926
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,560
{\an8}<i>It can be very, very detrimental,</i>

927
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:06,520
{\an8}especially when you consider the age
of a lot of these creators.

928
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,879
{\an8}Well, this one's just foul.
He's like the at and the...

929
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:11,040
{\an8}the at might as well be a tweet itself.

- [laughter]

931

"You are so fat it's embarr-is-ing.

935
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,879
I laughed so much when I heard
that you cried every day after school

936
00:49:32,879 --> 00:49:34,240
because you were bullied,

937
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,799
just because you are so ugly and fat.
Ha, ha, ha." [laughs]

938
00:49:36,799 --> 00:49:39,640

So, yeah, it's been a long day.</i>

940
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,839
From my lighting, I look okay,
but I don't know, now I look like shit.

941
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:59,480
I look like utter shit.

<i>People online find your weakness
and pounce on that.</i>

944
00:50:15,399 --> 00:50:20,080
So I imagine it would've been really hard.

945
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:23,920
You could get 368 comments, right?

946
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,399
<i>Seven of those will be horrific,
hateful comments</i>

947
00:50:28,399 --> 00:50:30,879
<i>but the other 300-odd are really nice,</i>

948
00:50:30,879 --> 00:50:33,160
<i>but your brain completely blanks them</i>

949
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:36,080

{\an8}Oh, no. Oh, no.

00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:00,200
When you're happy with yourself,
making three videos a day is a breeze

955
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,279
because you're doing something you love
and think,

956
00:51:02,279 --> 00:51:04,319
"Yeah, cool.
I can't wait to click upload."

957
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,480
<i>When you're not happy within yourself,</i>

958
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,799
<i>it's almost like people expect
three videos a day.</i>

959
00:51:09,799 --> 00:51:12,319
<i>I don't feel good enough
to post three videos a day,</i>

960
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:16,240
{\an8}<i>and it's only so long
you can burn that end of it</i>

961
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,440
{\an8}<i>before it bites you
and that's where I think I...</i>

962
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:22,000
{\an8}<i>I got to a point where
I just wasn't happy at all.</i>

963
00:51:23,279 --> 00:51:27,040
[Simon] <i>When Ethan was at his lowest,
he kept everything to himself a lot.</i>

964
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,000
<i>So I wish he'd spoken to us</i>

965
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,759
'cause we could've helped
in any way we could.

966
00:51:31,759 --> 00:51:33,359
In my head, like I feel like

967
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,520
I should've picked up
on things a little bit earlier

968
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,359
but, at the same time,
I was out a lot, drinking loads,

969
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,200
<i>so that was pretty normal for me.</i>

970
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,879
<i>He was drinking a lot
but wasn't really going out as much,</i>

971
00:51:44,879 --> 00:51:49,359
<i>so he would just stay at home
and drink while playing video games.</i>

972
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,720
It definitely got to a point
where like look we...

973
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,720
we've gone through a whole bottle of JD
in one night.

974
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,480
Like that was probably where
I started raising eyebrows.

975
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,960
[Ethan] <i>Bottles of Jack Daniels
were going quickly.</i>

976
00:52:02,879 --> 00:52:06,640
<i>I think like 250 quids' worth of weed
a week. That's nuts.</i>

977
00:52:08,759 --> 00:52:11,759
I said, "Listen it's fine.
Like, I'm okay. I'm in control of it."

978
00:52:11,759 --> 00:52:13,720
Bollocks.
I wasn't in control of it at all.

979
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:17,920
I'm exhausted and... and the expectation
is getting the better of me, I think.

980
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,040
I think it's just getting
the better of me.

981
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,960
I've been running myself into the ground

982
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:25,120
till like 4:00 or 5:00,
half past 5:00 in the morning

983
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:27,640
and like, "I do not feel okay."

984
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:32,359
[engine whirring]

985
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,759
<i>I knew I was a burden,
like a shit person to be around.</i>

986
00:52:38,759 --> 00:52:41,200
<i>So it was tough, mentally.</i>

987
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:46,279
<i>I've had like the thoughts of like,
"Oh, this is shit.</i>

988
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,960
<i>If I whack myself off,
then this all ends."</i>

989
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,040
<i>It's really dark, right,</i>

990
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:01,240
<i>'cause I know there's a big bridge
with like concrete pillars on it.</i>

991
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:07,200
<i>So that was like,
"Oh, I know where I could do it."</i>

992
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:12,279
<i>And that's a horrible thought process.</i>

993
00:53:12,279 --> 00:53:17,279
<i>It was more like, "That's it. Cool. Done."</i>

994
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:33,879
I had a knocking at my door
at, like... literally like 3:00, 4:00 a.m.

995
00:53:34,759 --> 00:53:36,600
And it was Ethan's girlfriend at the time,

996
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:40,960
and she's telling me that he's, erm,
been drinking and he's gone out,

997
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,240
and he's taken the car,
and she doesn't know where he is.

998
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,799
He's not answering his phone.

999
00:53:45,799 --> 00:53:50,240
And I'm like...
I didn't know what to do really, er, like,

1000
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,520
"What do I do? Do I call the police
and tell them my friend's drink driving?"

1001
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,680
Like I'm trying to find out where he is.

1002
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,960
I was kind of just in a state of...

1003
00:53:59,799 --> 00:54:02,200
I don't know, confusion, really.

1004
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:06,000
I mean, at that point,
you know, we're all...

1005
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:12,720
we're all fearing for our... one of our
best friend's lives kind of thing. Erm...

1006
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:19,080
[Ethan] <i>I just broke down.</i>

1007
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:23,640
<i>I just broke down and just said like,
"I can't do it, man. I can't do it."</i>

1008
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,160
<i>It's like a relief moment like,</i>

1009
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,240
<i>the crying on my friend,
it's like a relief moment.</i>

1010
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:32,279
<i>Like you can finally start getting
across to someone that,</i>

1011
00:54:32,279 --> 00:54:37,359
<i>"I'm so done, man. I've reached my limit.
I need help."</i>

1012
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:39,640
And that's, again,
it comes with the pride thing.

1013
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:43,279
You've gotta be able to drop this pride,
this act, this ego of thinking,

1014
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:47,480
"Oh, it'll get better. I'll be all right.
Oh, you'll be fine. I can get through it."

1015
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:50,640
So just speak to people.
You have to do it.

1016
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,160
You have to open up.
You have to speak to people.

1017
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:57,480
Ethan's story made the friendship group
a lot stronger,

1018
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:01,480
erm, because we were now more aware
of things going on.

1019
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,120
<i>Because before that,
you hear about these things,</i>

1020
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,440
but you're not really tuned in.

1021
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,359
You don't think it's gonna be your friends

1022
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:09,240
that are going through this.

1023
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:13,000
So I think that was... a big wake-up call
for everyone, honestly.

1024
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,240
- Mate.
- [man] Yes, bro.

1025
00:55:18,879 --> 00:55:20,200
[laughs]

1026
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,600
Right, turn side on.

1027
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,080
- This way? Back.
- Yeah.

1028
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:29,759
Here we go. How big is Behzinga? 103.1 kg.

1029
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:33,600
[woman] <i>With Ethan,
I was personally inspired by his journey.</i>

1030
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:37,920
He went through a lot of personal growth
during that time

1031
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,640
<i>and I think what's been really fundamental</i>

1032
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,759
is his ability to be able
to really be raw with it.

1033
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:46,720
[shouting]

1034
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,600
Nine, eight, come on. Come on, come on.

1035
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,560
Keep pushing.

1036
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:51,720
Push, push. Don't stop.

1037
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,759
Six, five, four, three, two, one.

1038
00:55:53,759 --> 00:55:56,040
Time. Well done.

1039
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:57,799
Not a joke.

1040
00:55:57,799 --> 00:55:59,759
[woman] <i>To see someone pull through that,</i>

1041
00:55:59,759 --> 00:56:02,680
<i>and what we have seen
in the past couple of years as well,</i>

1042
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,640
is that a lot of men
don't get the support they need.

1043
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,480
<i>And I think to see that</i>

1044
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:13,759
<i>shows that the new generation
have something relatable to look at</i>

1045
00:56:13,759 --> 00:56:16,399
and see that
if they were ever in that situation,

1046
00:56:16,399 --> 00:56:17,759
there's always a way out.

1047
00:56:17,759 --> 00:56:21,399
Well, hello. Welcome to 2019
on the Behzinga channel.

1048
00:56:21,399 --> 00:56:24,240
How are you? I hope you're, er,
gonna have a great year.

1049
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,440
I messed that up with my mouth
but we're here.

1050
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,720
- [Josh] Let's say Ethan got big again.
- Yeah.

1051
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,680
- Don't worry, he is. [laughs]
- [laughter]

1052
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,879
How do you... but now... knowing
things he's gone through as well, like--

1053
00:56:34,879 --> 00:56:37,920
Yeah. No, I... no, no, no.
I know he's gone through...

1054
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,960
[Josh] He's gone through a lot of pizzas.

1055
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,480
[laughter]

1056
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:46,240
- I can hear his mind working.
- [laughter]

1057
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,799
- You lot. [laughs]
- [laughing]

1058
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,440
I think it's like... just British culture
at the same time as well,

1059
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,520
like we're all brought up on
bringing each other down.

1060
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,399
- You tease your mates.
- Yeah, like lad humour. Is that right?

1061
00:56:58,399 --> 00:57:00,319
[laughs] That's so sad.

1062
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:03,680
I tell you the difference, yeah?
Straight up as the person who it is. Okay.

1063
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,319
You lot, I know at the end of the day,

1064
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:08,960
if someone come up to me
and said the stuff that you say...

1065
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,319
- You'd say...
- Oh, no. Don't get...

1066
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:13,200
- They'll get slapped.
- You say, "Who do you think you are?"

1067
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:17,440
So it comes down to the YouTube audience
thinking they are one of your mates.

1068
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,319
So the major problem from it
came these random people...

1069
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:21,240
All the time.

1070
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,160
Anywhere, bro,
on the field playing football.

1071
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,879
- Fat [mouthing]
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1072
00:57:24,879 --> 00:57:27,120
You're thinking, "You don't even know me."

1073
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,560
But our... our humour is now...
everyone sees it,

1074
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:33,279
- and they think they're in on it.
- They're a part as well.

1075
00:57:33,279 --> 00:57:35,240
- They feel part of the group.
- In real life,

1076
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:38,160
I'd be anywhere, bro.
Er, or like I'd be going somewhere,

1077
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,600
"Oh, you fat, whatever."

1078
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,480
And it's like, "What do you want me to do?

1079
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,520
"I don't know you."

1080
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,640
I don't know you, yeah.

1081
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:46,759
- You've just met me and abused me.
- It's true. Yeah, actually.

1082
00:57:46,759 --> 00:57:49,319
Imagine I come up to you and just went,
"You fat loser."

1083
00:57:49,319 --> 00:57:52,359
You'd be like,
"Ah. All right, bro. Chill out."

1084
00:57:52,359 --> 00:57:53,399
[Tobi] Shit, yeah.

1085
00:57:53,399 --> 00:57:56,799
- Now as we're actual adults now...
- [all] Yeah.

1086
00:57:56,799 --> 00:58:02,200
...I think when someone is clearly not
in the space, their minds are normally in,

1087
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:05,560
people do even in group chats
will just say like, "Everyone good?"

1088
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,839
And it can be a one question,
but that's all it needs.

1089
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:09,720
To be honest, it's like maturing, I think.

1090
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:13,680
But also we grew up in a generation
where mental health wasn't talked about.

1091
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,600
At school, you wouldn't talk about it.
You'd never have like...

1092
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:17,640
No. Not a chance.

1093
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,839
We've never been taught any of this stuff

1094
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:22,640
and then we're dealing
with millions of people watching us.

1095
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,919
How do you teach someone...

1096
00:58:23,919 --> 00:58:28,080
You don't. You can't be online
and have really thin skin.

1097
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,480
We learnt that quick.

1098
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:33,000
You've gotta realise that this is
part and parcel of broadcasting yourself.

1099
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,640
Did anyone go like therapy or anything?

1100
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,839
I've been to therapy. Yeah, yeah.

1101
00:58:36,839 --> 00:58:39,319
When I went to therapy,
I literally just spoke.

1102
00:58:39,319 --> 00:58:42,600
It was someone to listen,
and as I'm talking and saying how I feel,

1103
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:46,040
I'm also processing it and understanding
and then dealing with it.

1104
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,919
You find yourself
answering your questions.

1105
00:58:47,919 --> 00:58:50,359
Basically I figured it out for myself.
Yeah, yeah.

1106
00:58:50,359 --> 00:58:53,560
So you find benefit
from therapy, right?

1107
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:56,160
Yeah. No, I thought therapy
was extremely helpful.

1108
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:59,759
She gave me the key to open these doors
and I was like, "Oh, wow."

1109
00:58:59,759 --> 00:59:03,759
I realised, "Oh, okay.
I now know what I want to do,

1110
00:59:03,759 --> 00:59:08,200
and how to get there,
and you know, what's... best for me.

1111
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,960
And you know, er, something as simple
as saying "no."

1112
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,399
Like I've said "no" to so many things now

1113
00:59:13,399 --> 00:59:15,440
because I'm like,
I don't have to say "yes."

1114
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,759
- I don't have to always please people.
- Mmm-hmm.

1115
00:59:17,759 --> 00:59:19,440
The reason why I would always say "yes"

1116
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,640
is because in my childhood,
I'd always say "yes" to my parents.

1117
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,600
Like no matter what.

1118
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:27,000
If I didn't wanna do it,
I have to say "yes" because I'd get beat,

1119
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,200
or something like that. [laughs]

1120
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,839
So now, I literally just say "no"

1121
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:34,560
and I understand I need time for myself
to do things.

1122
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,520
- Prioritising myself.
- Yeah, exactly.

1123
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,240
We've all got better
at the balancing act.

1124
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:42,240
I think talking about your mental health
has become a big part of online especially

1125
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:46,359
because people are starting to understand
that these people that you idolise

1126
00:59:46,359 --> 00:59:48,759
are normal people,
and they have real feelings.

1127
00:59:56,879 --> 00:59:58,560
[indistinct chattering]

1128
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:10,759
[Tobi] <i>We're here for our second physical
Sides location launch.</i>

1129
01:00:10,759 --> 01:00:13,600
<i>- First one is at BOXPARK, Wembley.</i>
- [Josh] <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

1130
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:18,080
<i>This one is Gravity Wandsworth,
a place I am very fond of.</i>

1131
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:21,480
<i>Come here a couple of times in my own time
to bowl, electric go-kart.</i>

1132
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:25,600
But yeah, got a couple supporters
coming down to get some free food.

1133
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:28,120
Free food always tastes better,
by the way. Always.

1134
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,440
- How are you?
- I'm good. You?

1135
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,399
Good, good, good.

1136
01:00:31,399 --> 01:00:33,960
[Tobi] <i>If you're not learning,
you're not living.</i>

1137
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,040
[Josh] It's a good one.

1138
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,879
That's a good saying, innit?
I came up with that today.

1139
01:00:37,879 --> 01:00:39,839
- Why are you shaking your head?
- How?

1140
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:41,960
I'll dash this at your head.
What's your favourite?

1141
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:45,200
Live like others can't, so in time,
you can live like others won't.

1142
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:48,480
Live like others can't. [laughs]

1143
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,919
Wrong way round.
Wrong way round, by the way.

1144
01:00:50,919 --> 01:00:55,200
[laughs] You said that way, didn't it,
or did I say it? I can't.

1145
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,960
[laughs]

1146
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,680
Honestly, well, you could...
well, you could do that also.

1147
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:03,600
Next time, just don't be poor.
That's what you just said, bro.

1148
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,319
You said live like others can't. [laughs]

1149
01:01:05,319 --> 01:01:08,399
- [laughs] Won't say it again now.
- What's your...

1150
01:01:08,399 --> 01:01:11,799
No. It's to live like others won't.
So in time you live like others can't.

1151
01:01:11,799 --> 01:01:15,640
You know you put in the work,
do things that people won't do.

1152
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:18,680
- Eventually, hopefully, fingers crossed...
<i>- Inshallah.</i>

1153
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,879
Then you can, you know,
live life like others can't,

1154
01:01:20,879 --> 01:01:23,399
because they didn't put the work in,
didn't do the groundwork.

1155
01:01:23,399 --> 01:01:25,440
These waffle fries are incredible,
by the way.

1156
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:26,960
I'm not even chatting. Can I swear?

1157
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,200
- Wow.
- I can swear, I'm not even chatting shit.

1158
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:33,120
- Do you want a waffle fry?
- [laughs]

1159
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:36,720
No, but seriously, does anyone want any
'cause it's fucking incredible.

1160
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,040
I guess you point it out.

1161
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,399
Literally everyone's looking at us.
I get so paranoid

1162
01:01:40,399 --> 01:01:42,319
Not surprised.

1163
01:01:42,879 --> 01:01:44,480
- [cheering]
- Hey, it's a lot of people.

1164
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,720
Oh, shit. It's insane in here.

1165
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:50,440
It's this incredible moment where
you get the real-world manifestation

1166
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:53,160
of those likes, those comments,
those views

1167
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,080
<i>and you realise just how powerful</i>

1168
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:58,720
<i>this incredible content publishing machine
the boys have created really is.</i>

1169
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,799
[cheering]

1170
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:13,680
[boy] The Sidemen, they've inspired me
since I was like eight years old.

1171
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,839
I've been watching them for a long time.

1172
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:17,279
They're just fun to watch.

1173
01:02:17,279 --> 01:02:21,160
They make videos on, er, different types
of topics and they're just fun.

1174
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,600
[man] <i>They're just good.</i>

1175
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:25,600
<i>Like they've just got the whole scene,
the whole YouTube scene.</i>

1176
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:30,160
[cheering]

1177
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:34,359
They're those type of content creators
that put a smile on my face.

1178
01:02:34,359 --> 01:02:37,799
I literally look so forward
to watching their videos like every day.

1179
01:02:37,799 --> 01:02:41,200
[boy] <i>Watching Sidemen videos,
obviously it's all banter and jokes,</i>

1180
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,399
<i>but then there's also lessons
that you learn.</i>

1181
01:02:43,399 --> 01:02:47,120
You kinda see the friendship,
the teamwork, the whole communication.

1182
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:50,240
They have this fun side to them,
so I wanna follow that, too.

1183
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:54,120
[crowd laughing]

1184
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:57,279
Is this... is this safe?

1185
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:59,440
[shouting and cheering]

1186
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,919
[Tobi] <i>To us, we're messing around.
We're having fun.</i>

1187
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:21,080
<i>We're creating content.
We're doing something cool. It's cool.</i>

1188
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:24,160
<i>But you also sometimes forget
that for someone else,</i>

1189
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,000
<i>that's their escape from reality</i>

1190
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
<i>or that's the thing that's gonna get them
through the day.</i>

1191
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,200
<i>And that really comes to light
when you speak to some supporters.</i>

1192
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:37,319
<i>I feel like the biggest thing
that separates us from a lot of creators</i>

1193
01:03:37,319 --> 01:03:40,000
is people really connect to us
as a friendship group.

1194
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,600
A lot of them say they feel like
they're the eighth member.

1195
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,480
[Randolph] <i>Tobi, honestly, is one of
the nicest people that I know in life.</i>

1196
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,480
Not just in the Sidemen.
He's one of the nicest people that I know.

1197
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:01,879
In his nature, he's kind.
In his day-to-day life, he's just kind.

1198
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:04,839
He always thinks
of the nicest thing possible.

1199
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:10,279
[Tobi] <i>It makes me feel like
my parents raised me right,</i>

1200
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:13,080
<i>but it's also just the way I am.
I've always been that way.</i>

1201
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:16,200
<i>I don't know any kind of other way to be.</i>

1202
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:20,879
<i>I have nothing but the utmost respect
for both my parents.</i>

1203
01:04:20,879 --> 01:04:23,160
<i>My dad was working three jobs at a point.</i>

1204
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:24,439
<i>He'd go out at night.</i>

1205
01:04:24,439 --> 01:04:26,600
<i>I wouldn't see him 'cause he'd be sleeping</i>

1206
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,520
<i>and I'd be at school and whatnot.</i>

1207
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:31,960
<i>Or he'd be working another job,
his second job, his third job.</i>

1208
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:36,879
<i>I've always got a joy
from helping other people.</i>

1209
01:04:36,879 --> 01:04:38,200
I love this guy.

1210
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:41,080
I like to see the people around me happy.
It makes me feel happy.

1211
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:42,919
{\an8}Okay. Open your eyes, Simon.

1212
01:04:42,919 --> 01:04:45,520
- Oh! [laughs] Unreal.
- Good man.

1213
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,799
- How do you feel?
- A million likes. [laughs]

1214
01:04:47,799 --> 01:04:49,279
[laughter]

1215
01:04:49,279 --> 01:04:51,560
Hey, cut the video, man.

1216
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:53,279
In the position I'm in now,

1217
01:04:53,279 --> 01:04:55,799
to be able to help my family
when they need it

1218
01:04:55,799 --> 01:04:59,919
or my friends when they need it
or complete strangers sometimes,

1219
01:04:59,919 --> 01:05:02,720
it feels like I'm contributing
something to the world.

1220
01:05:10,359 --> 01:05:13,720
[crowd chanting indistinctly]

1221
01:05:16,359 --> 01:05:17,799
- [man] What do we want?
- Justice!

1222
01:05:17,799 --> 01:05:20,040
- [man] When do we want it?
- Now!

1223
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,319
{\an8}[Tobi] <i>Since the George Floyd incident,</i>

1224
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:26,759
{\an8}<i>my mind has been going non-stop.
I've been struggling.</i>

1225
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:36,200
{\an8}You're tired of hearing
about our racist experiences?

1226
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:42,839
{\an8}Imagine, imagine how tired we are
of experiencing it. Imagine.

1227
01:05:42,839 --> 01:05:44,919
{\an8}And I'm one of the lucky ones.

1228
01:05:44,919 --> 01:05:48,240
{\an8}I'm one of the fucking...
I'm so blessed, you lot.

1229
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:51,560
{\an8}I can't tell you
how fucking blessed I am. [cries]

1230
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:58,240
{\an8}[cries]

1231
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:07,439
{\an8}It was heartbreaking to see Tobi like that
'cause Tobi is always bubbly.

1232
01:06:07,439 --> 01:06:11,960
So to see him in that kind of mood
and, talking about this kind of stuff,

1233
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:16,560
I remember trying not to shed a tear
watching Tobi on the stream.

1234
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,720
That might have been the moment
when he realised,

1235
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:22,439
"This stuff happens to me, you know,
similar, and I've never spoken about it,

1236
01:06:22,439 --> 01:06:26,359
now the whole world's talking about it
when it's ended fatally."

1237
01:06:26,359 --> 01:06:28,399
So, maybe, it was a good time to share.

1238
01:06:28,399 --> 01:06:29,399
It doesn't surprise me.

1239
01:06:29,399 --> 01:06:32,720
Tobi will speak his mind
when he wants to speak his mind.

1240
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,359
{\an8}If I tell you the amount of shit
I've been through,

1241
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:38,480
{\an8}you wouldn't believe it.
Imagine the unlucky ones.

1242
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:42,960
{\an8}Imagine the ones that are dying
at the hands of these...

1243
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,879
{\an8}I ain't wanna call them humans
'cause they're not human, man.

1244
01:06:45,879 --> 01:06:51,799
{\an8}They don't act human, they don't.
They fucking don't. [cries]

1245
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:57,759
{\an8}I'm so sorry for breaking down.
I really didn't wanna break down.

1246
01:06:57,759 --> 01:07:02,640
{\an8}I really, really tried to compose myself.
I've... I've lost my shit, man.

1247
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:05,319
{\an8}<i>The response that I got from that
was amazing.</i>

1248
01:07:05,319 --> 01:07:08,200
Yeah that's just one example of me
talking about something serious

1249
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,640
and it having an impact.

1250
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:12,040
But it's in my nature
to talk about that stuff

1251
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,359
because I guess I wear my heart
on my sleeve.

1252
01:07:14,359 --> 01:07:17,919
{\an8}<i>I'm not afraid to show my emotions
or how I feel about certain things.</i>

1253
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:21,960
{\an8}<i>I share my feelings with my audience
'cause that's how they connect.</i>

1254
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,960
That's how they view you as a human.

1255
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:37,160
[dramatic music playing]

1256
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:48,560
Oh, God. First player off the bus.
Come on.

1257
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:51,240
Jeez. Let's go.

1258
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,720

01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,520
'cause we've been Sidemen fans
for a really long time.

1261
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,839
It's pretty exciting for us.

1262
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:14,399
USA. New Mexico, USA.

1263
01:08:14,399 --> 01:08:16,519
Erm, Essex. So northern Essex.

1264
01:08:16,519 --> 01:08:21,279
Sidemen Sunday, every Sunday,
telly goes straight on to YouTube.

1265
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:24,200
After like a stressful week,
you've got Sidemen Sunday coming.

1266
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:29,160
You can eat your takeaway, put it on,
and you'll be... escape from the world

1267
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:32,160
and just have a laugh,
and we always watch it every week.

1268
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:33,840
I've watched them for so long and like...

1269
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:38,279
they're just so creative in what they do
and every video's just, like, amazing.

1270
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:43,240
I love the one where the Sidemen
became parents for 24 hours.

1271
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:45,840
That's one of my favourites.

1272
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:49,240
Personally, I'm here to see
Miniminter and KSI but for you...

1273
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,920
Well, for him, he's more of a Simon fan,

1274
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:54,599
but I'm actually here for Speed
from the YouTube Allstars,

1275
01:08:54,599 --> 01:08:55,880
I really love Speed.

1276
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:58,920
So. I'm really hoping he'll score some...
quite a few goals.

1277
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:03,840
{\an8}Oh!

1278
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:04,800
{\an8}Yeah.

1279
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:08,040
{\an8}Oi, Speed. What are you? Striker?

1280
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:09,599
- Left wing.
- Left wing, cheese.

1281
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:11,519
[laughs]

1282
01:09:11,519 --> 01:09:13,519
- Oh, my God. Look at it, man.
- Ooh. Oh, my God.

1283
01:09:13,519 --> 01:09:15,599
[indistinct chattering]

1284
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:20,800
- [Vik] Chris joined our side.
- Come on.

1285
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:23,840
{\an8}- You've been getting a bit of flak.
- Yeah. It wasn't even my decision.

1286
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:27,319
{\an8}No it was actually our decision
to bring Chris over to,

1287
01:09:27,319 --> 01:09:29,720
{\an8}what we believe
is balancing out the teams.

1288
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,800
- If we've done that or not, who knows.
- Yeah.

1289
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,359
It's always so difficult to tell

1290
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:36,840
'cause there's loads of people
that you've never seen play before so...

1291
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,920
- Yes. Exactly.
- You definitely rigged it for them.

1292
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,200
I've never played soccer, football,
whatever so.

1293
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:44,840
I have no idea what I'm doing.
So, if it was even, you've just taken...

1294
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:45,880
Stop saying this.

1295
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,479
[laughter]

1296
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,479
Fuck KSI.

1297
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:56,200
- Football.
- [player] Let's go, boys.

1298
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,240
[booing]

1299
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,360
About to bust your ass. Bust your ass.

1300
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:07,720
- Come on then, huh?
- Bust your ass.

1301
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:11,200
I don't give a shit, bro.
I don't give a shit, bro.

1302
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,280
[shouting indistinctly]

1303
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,760
[barking]

1304
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,360
We're about to bust their ass, man.
It's over.

1305
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:24,440
[indistinct chattering]

1306
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:42,440
[Stuart Jones] <i>In the match in 2022,
the match sold out within one evening.</i>

1307
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:44,400
<i>It would've sold out immediately,</i>

1308
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:47,639
{\an8}but we broke the servers
when tickets went on sale.

1309
01:10:47,639 --> 01:10:50,440
{\an8}There was 170,000 people
trying to buy tickets.

1310
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:54,440
[Tobi] <i>It's the first charity match
we've done in four years.</i>

1311
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:58,440
<i>It's the first event that we've had
as a group since before the pandemic...</i>

1312
01:10:59,559 --> 01:11:01,400
Let's go, boys.

1313
01:11:02,679 --> 01:11:06,200
...where we've got to be with
such a large amount of our audience.

1314
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:09,080
[crowd cheering]

1315
01:11:10,639 --> 01:11:13,200
[commentator 1] <i>The crowd's
welcoming these players.</i>

1316
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:18,559
<i>It's getting lively here at The Valley.
1.3 million people watching this.</i>

1317
01:11:18,559 --> 01:11:20,240
[commentator 2] <i>It's exciting.</i>

1318
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:23,440
<i>We might have two, three,
four million people watching at once.</i>

1319
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:27,400
[commentator 1] <i>Oh, it's unbelievable.
Those numbers are simply sensational.</i>

1320
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:32,840
- [whistle blows]
- [commentator 1] <i>Captain takes it quickly.</i>

1321
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:35,679
<i>Remember he scored his goal, I think,
in the first two minutes.</i>

1322
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,720
<i>- </i> [commentator 2] <i>Yeah.</i>
- [crowd gasps]

1323
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:41,000
<i>They're underway.
This is not gonna be a nice game.</i>

1324
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,080
<i>Speed is celebrating.
First blood has gone to Speed.</i>

1325
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:47,720
[commentator 1] <i>It's what we're gonna see.
It's little battles all around the pitch.</i>

1326
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:51,320
[commentator 2] <i>Chunkz can hit one here.
He's hit one. Pieface.</i> [cheering]

1327
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:54,080
<i>Goal! Oh, my word!</i>

1328
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,720
<i>Take a bow, Chunkz!</i>

1329
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:58,679
[commentator 1] <i>It's still going
for the YouTube all stars.</i>

1330
01:11:58,679 --> 01:12:03,679
<i>Could be a chance for Niko Omilana!
It's in! It's two-nil to the Allstars!</i>

1331
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:05,760
We'd all said all we want is goals.

1332
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,480
Even if we lost eight-five,
we just want goals.

1333
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,360
[commentator 2] <i>Simon! Can he get it
to Vik? He's through.</i>

1334
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,320
<i>Go on, Vik.</i>

1335
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,720
<i>Chance for the Sidemen!</i>

1336
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:17,120
[cheering]

1337
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:19,400
[Vik] <i>Everything became
a little bit poetic.</i>

1338
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:21,679
<i>We were back on track. Morale was up.</i>

1339
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:25,679
The stadium was happy,
and we were set for a good game.

1340
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:28,200
<i>- Randolph to Simon. One-two.
- Oh, that's gorgeous.</i>

1341
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:31,040
<i>- It's gotta be a goal! Oh, it is!
- Two-two!</i>

1342
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:33,320
[commentator 1] <i>What a game!
It's the shot.</i>

1343
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:34,679
[commentator 2] <i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

1344
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:38,519
Instantly, we're like, "Okay.
Well, this game is already a classic.

1345
01:12:38,519 --> 01:12:39,720
It's already amazing."

1346
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:41,040
[commentator 1] <i>Oh, will it in?</i>

1347
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,920
<i>What a game!
You can't take your eyes off it!</i>

1348
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:49,639
<i>Now Jizzle outside the box!
Oh, what a ball that is. Wow. Wow.</i>

1349
01:12:49,639 --> 01:12:52,320
<i>We could be going to penalties here.
Seven apiece.</i>

1350
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:55,760
<i>- Hang on! Hang on! Oh, my God!
- </i> [commentator 2] <i>Oh, my God!</i>

1351
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:59,800
<i>Miniminter gets his hat trick
and what a way to seal it.</i>

1352
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:03,160
<i>But the referee is gonna
bring the whistle to his lips...</i>

1353
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:07,760
<i>- And it's all over!
- </i> [commentator 1] <i>It is full time. 8-7.</i>

1354
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,960
<i>One of the best games we've seen
on YouTube.</i>

1355
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:15,760
[Simon] <i>I'd love to have gone to penalties</i>

1356
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,400
<i>just for how much of a spectacle
that would've been.</i>

1357
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:21,880
<i>But at the same time, I'm not gonna
complain about scoring a winner</i>

1358
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:23,920
in front of 2.5 million people, am I?

1359
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,559
[cheering]

1360
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:32,880
[Zeitoune] <i>It has been absolutely
fascinating and heartwarming</i>

1361
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:36,519
<i>to see how much this match
has been discussed</i>

1362
01:13:36,519 --> 01:13:38,240
{\an8}<i>and how much the content</i>

1363
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:40,760
{\an8}<i>of people discussing the match,
has trended.</i>

1364
01:13:41,719 --> 01:13:43,960
{\an8}<i>And even if you look
at the number of concurrent viewers</i>

1365
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:45,280
{\an8}<i>they had on that match</i>

1366
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:48,519
{\an8}<i>that probably surpasses
the concurrent views</i>

1367
01:13:48,519 --> 01:13:51,080
{\an8}on huge events that we have

1368
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:55,719
{\an8}like the Champions League final,
like the funeral of the Queen, you know?

1369
01:13:55,719 --> 01:13:59,719
{\an8}Those numbers are absolutely staggering.

1370
01:13:59,719 --> 01:14:01,519
[cheering]

1371
01:14:06,599 --> 01:14:11,120
So far it's one million,
seventy-four thousand, three hundred and--

1372
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:14,200
[cheering]

1373
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:19,120
[Ethan] <i>I don't think we really understood
how big this one was gonna be.</i>

1374
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,639
So to be able to say, er...

1375
01:14:20,639 --> 01:14:24,320
we raised over a million pounds
for charity is absolutely gigantic.

1376
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,679
And that goes to really good charities,

1377
01:14:26,679 --> 01:14:30,360
and good to have a charity partner onboard
that is one of the group.

1378
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:32,960
We're trying to organise some events
for this coming year

1379
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:34,639
to raise money for M7 Education.

1380
01:14:34,639 --> 01:14:38,080
If you guys do wanna know more about M7,
I'll stop talking about it now,

1381
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,920
but I'll leave a link to it
in the description down below,

1382
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:43,800
and you guys can go check it out
and donate if you want to.

1383
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,440
You're a horrible person if you don't.

1384
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:50,480
<i>So my brother worked at a bunch of schools</i>

1385
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,760
<i>that couldn't afford to go
on school trips.</i>

1386
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:57,000
So I'd always said to him
that I wanna start a charity.

1387
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,080
When you get into a position where you can
do good, use it.

1388
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:04,800
So M7, for those that don't know,
we find schools that are in areas

1389
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,360
<i>where the students might not be able
to afford to go on school trips</i>

1390
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:10,719
<i>- and have these educational experiences.
- Hmm.</i>

1391
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:13,120
And it's all funded through you.

1392
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:16,160
Like the whole... and as of last week,

1393
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:19,200
I'm pretty certain I can say,
got charity status.

1394
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,480
- Let's go.
- Finally, a charity...

1395
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:24,800
For me it was... when I went to school,
I was lucky enough to go on school trips.

1396
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:28,320
So I always remember those way more
than the rest of the school year.

1397
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:32,000
So we signed up over a thousand students
to go on school trips.

1398
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,280
- Wow.
- Which is pretty awesome.

1399
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,599
Thank you, M7 team! [cheering]

1400
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:41,679
Being able to give, however many kids,
the chance to go on those school trips

1401
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:43,480
and make their own memories is...

1402
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:45,639
seemed like a no-brainer
for me and my brother.

1403
01:15:51,599 --> 01:15:53,599
[Randolph] <i>The misconception
about Simon is that...</i>

1404
01:15:53,599 --> 01:15:55,679
<i>he always tells me he's self-conscious</i>

1405
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:57,679
<i>or he's not sure that he has something.</i>

1406
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:00,599
So Josh has got like his clothing brand,
JJ's got his music,

1407
01:16:00,599 --> 01:16:02,120
Simon's always asking what's his?

1408
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:04,400
Well, his is just hard work
and consistency.

1409
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:08,920
<i>He like posts about six videos a day
on about 15 different channels.</i>

1410
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:13,440
He's just like relentless with it.
So every day, non-stop hard work.

1411
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,599
He never misses a day.
He never misses the content.

1412
01:16:15,599 --> 01:16:18,639
So he just works super, super hard,
and does deserve credit.

1413
01:16:18,639 --> 01:16:21,400
Yo! What's going on?
Welcome to another Reddit video.

1414
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:24,080
That's right. I am posting videos.

1415
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,519
Remember my favourite post or comment
will win $1,000.

1416
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:30,840
He's stubborn with...
his work ethic has never changed.

1417
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:33,440
It's like, "We need to get this done
and that's that."

1418
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,960
{\an8}<i>Like he'd run the More Sidemen channel
for years.</i>

1419
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:39,000
<i>Without him being on that channel
and taking responsibility,</i>

1420
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,160
<i>I don't think it is where it is today.</i>

1421
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:43,040
<i>So his stubbornness pays off for him</i>

1422
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,480
<i>because he has the right mindset
about things</i>

1423
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:48,559
<i>and when he's made his decision,
he's made a decision.</i>

1424
01:16:48,559 --> 01:16:51,360
So it's not a bad stubborn Simon
when you do see this.

1425
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,920
It's a good stubborn.
You're good. [laughs]

1426
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,719
I don't know how Simon does it, man.

1427
01:16:55,719 --> 01:16:57,599
Simon's got all the money in the world.

1428
01:16:57,719 --> 01:17:00,559
He's got the Sidemen stuff doing well,
and he still grinds.

1429
01:17:00,559 --> 01:17:03,519
<i>Every day he's posting,
like, multiple videos.</i>

1430
01:17:03,519 --> 01:17:07,840
[Zeitoune] <i>Consistency really does matter
on the platform.</i>

1431
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,160
<i>And when you have these super fans,</i>

1432
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,760
<i>they have expectations</i>

1433
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,960
of when you're going to deliver
the content that they want.

1434
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,040
And so it's an anticipation.
It's an excitement.

1435
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:28,360
{\an8}Tanya Pile, slate five, take one.

1436
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:31,120
{\an8}So the boys are, obviously,
the creative brains.

1437
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,320
{\an8}They will come up with what videos to do,

1438
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:36,400
{\an8}and they'll chat to me about
what they would like that video to be,

1439
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,920
{\an8}and then I do my best to make it happen.

1440
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:42,679
How's it going, guys?

1441
01:17:42,679 --> 01:17:44,960
And welcome to Sidemen hide and seek

1442
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,240
on a jumbo 747 plane.

1443
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:48,679
[cheering]

1444
01:17:48,679 --> 01:17:52,519
[screams] Hey, yo! I can't do this.
I can't.

1445
01:17:52,519 --> 01:17:54,519
Fuckin' hell.

1446
01:17:54,519 --> 01:17:57,440
[Pile] <i>As time's gone on,
got bigger studios,</i>

1447
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:00,360
<i>bigger locations, more travel.</i>

1448
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:02,679
They're always wanting to be
one step ahead,

1449
01:18:02,679 --> 01:18:06,240
and it's really exciting, and we're always
like, "What can we do next?"

1450
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:08,160
I'm like, "How much bigger can we go?"

1451
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:11,200
Before lockdown, we had...
I don't know how many million subscribers.

1452
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:15,000
We've got like 17 now.
So like lockdown was huge for the Sidemen.

1453
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:15,920
Whoo!

1454
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:17,920
[Ethan] <i>Because we was
that one consistent thing</i>

1455
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:20,400
<i>in people's lives that they could watch
every Sunday</i>

1456
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:23,200
<i>and then more Sidemen throughout the week.</i>

1457
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:25,760
[Harry] <i>I think probably after Covid,</i>

1458
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:28,360
and everyone had like two weeks inside
just watching our videos,

1459
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:29,639
that's when it got a bit mad.

1460
01:18:29,639 --> 01:18:33,519
I don't know if you can hear me, but
my balls are squished into my trousers.

1461
01:18:33,519 --> 01:18:36,320
I'm really proud of the growth
over the last few years.

1462
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,480
It's been phenomenal.

1463
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,360
- One, two, three!
- [all] Sidemen!

1464
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:46,760
Contrary to belief,
we actually don't really pay attention

1465
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:49,240
to trends or to dates that much.

1466
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:54,200
I think the, the bliss and the blessing
of Sidemen is it's long-form content

1467
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:57,120
that you get to really see
an insight into us

1468
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:58,440
and you get the true us.

1469
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:02,880
<i>If you was to focus on analytics and data
too much,</i>

1470
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,519
<i>you'll get a different product.</i>

1471
01:19:04,519 --> 01:19:07,800
You'll get a 16-minute video
which is very much in your face.

1472
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,519
You'll get a lot of great concepts,
video and views,

1473
01:19:10,519 --> 01:19:12,400
but you'll lose a lot of personality.

1474
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,800
<i>So, there's not many channels like ours</i>

1475
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,599
<i>where you can get away with
a two-and-a-half-hour long video</i>

1476
01:19:17,599 --> 01:19:19,160
<i>and get 90 million views.</i>

1477
01:19:20,519 --> 01:19:25,080
{\an8}We've had experts come along and people
who work with the likes of MrBeast.

1478
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:28,200
<i>The one kind of resounding thing
that they always say is,</i>

1479
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:30,320
"Everything we do shouldn't work."

1480
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,800
And that makes me laugh, right,

1481
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:34,639
'cause it's like... [laughs]
"It shouldn't work but, it does."

1482
01:19:34,639 --> 01:19:37,400
There's been a lot of group channels
that have tried and failed.

1483
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:40,440
We've got systems in place
that make things that always worked.

1484
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:42,120
{\an8}They've got these mad systems in place

1485
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:47,480
{\an8}that I don't think many other, er,
YouTube boy bands, er, have in place.

1486
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:48,400
{\an8}[laughs]

1487
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:49,360
[man] Run!

1488
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:52,440
<i>If someone's like 15 minutes late
for a shoot,</i>

1489
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:55,519
<i>then that means that they're gonna get
a yellow card.</i>

1490
01:19:55,519 --> 01:19:59,000
[Josh] <i>I remember at one point
it being a frustration for me and Simon</i>

1491
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,840
that certain people
who do less than others.

1492
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:05,599
And I knew that. I'm a control freak.
So I'm an enabler.

1493
01:20:05,599 --> 01:20:09,280
So I allow people to do nothing
because I'll do the work.

1494
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:12,240
So... that's kind of like where
a lot of systems probably came from.

1495
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,559
- The card system?
- [man] Yeah.

1496
01:20:14,559 --> 01:20:17,559
It holds people responsible.
That's what it does.

1497
01:20:17,559 --> 01:20:19,920
If you're half an hour late
to a real life shoot,

1498
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:21,120
you get a yellow card.

1499
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:23,200
If you're 15 minutes late
to an online shoot,

1500
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:24,240
it's a yellow card.

1501
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:27,440
If you're not wearing Sidemen clothing
at a Sidemen shoot, it is a yellow card.

1502
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:31,920
And we have a tally of how many videos
we've all taken charge of on the channel.

1503
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:34,280
So if you get two yellows...
[imitating buzzer] video gone.

1504
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:36,200
Oh, no, no, no, no. No, no, no.

1505
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:37,160
No, no, no, no.

1506
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:39,880
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.

1507
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:42,800
- You can't take five minutes to reply...
- Fuck it. Yeah.

1508
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,160
- ...location.
- Stop. No. We've literally just...

1509
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:47,639
Fam, we told him to turn.
He didn't fucking turn.

1510
01:20:47,639 --> 01:20:51,080
- We were here I swear.
- No, no. It's a yellow.

1511
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,400
- No. It's not.
- It's a yellow.

1512
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:53,880
It's not a yellow. I'm here!

1513
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:56,760
- The majority decides end of the day.
- I'm here, bro!

1514
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:58,679
- You can't argue with the majority.
- What? No.

1515
01:20:58,679 --> 01:21:00,599
It's a majority decision. It's a yellow.

1516
01:21:00,599 --> 01:21:02,200
Yeah but then... Because you're...

1517
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:04,440
Oh... Oh, he changes even though it's not.

1518
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,000
Majority decision.

1519
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,280
Yeah, we managed to be, what,
a couple seconds late.

1520
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:12,120
Er, I got very angry.

1521
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:15,920
<i>'cause no one wants a yellow card
because it means you have to do more work.</i>

1522
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,880
Yeah, I know. But it's just like...

1523
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:20,519
All right. All right.
Calm. Calm. All right.

1524
01:21:20,519 --> 01:21:22,800
When it was introduced,
it was alien to people.

1525
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,120
When you talk about it to people,

1526
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:28,000
it seems like someone's at the top
controlling us.

1527
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,400
But it's just a democratic choice
that works.

1528
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,760
It means that there's fairness
across the group

1529
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:35,080
there's a spread, er,
across everything we do.

1530
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:38,040
The way I see it from you two right now,
you're doing the,

1531
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:39,719
"Oh, but it's not fine for me."

1532
01:21:39,719 --> 01:21:44,080
- Do you... remember the Easter egg video?
- Other people... Yeah.

1533
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,800
I was there at one minute past...

1534
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,559
I will back you on...

1535
01:21:47,559 --> 01:21:50,280
Boys, calm. It's a yellow.

1536
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:53,080
- A-okay behind the scenes this is.
- [laughter]

1537
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:55,480
- [air horn honking]
- We need to film, come on.

1538
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:58,240
Within the Sidemen, obviously,
we have seven people

1539
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:00,960
and we have a sentence that rules all.

1540
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,880
The majority decides.

1541
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,160
I think it's nice to have a voting system

1542
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,880
and then for it not to become
an emotional debate.

1543
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:10,599
It's just like, "It got voted.
I was outvoted.

1544
01:22:10,599 --> 01:22:12,840
Fine. Let's proceed
as you guys think best."

1545
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:15,120
I think YouTubers of that period

1546
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:18,480
that it went from YouTubers made merch,
then they made books.

1547
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:22,080
- Yeah. Yeah.
- And then music came into it a little bit.

1548
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:25,480
And then more recent times,
YouTubers are trying expand horizons

1549
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:29,440
like, "What business can we make?
We could be next big things."

1550
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,639
So then, we've always had all these ideas.

1551
01:22:31,639 --> 01:22:35,040
It's like you said... how do you build
a team to launch these things.

1552
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,960
Ideas that are relative to us

1553
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,880
like doing mukbang, food round,
drinking videos,

1554
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:42,840
it's stuff that's relative to us
that we have an actual interest in

1555
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:45,800
that will outlive just us as creators.

1556
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:48,200
- I hate business.
- You hate business?

1557
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,160
- [Ethan] I hate business.
- Do ya?

1558
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:52,599
Yeah. I really like videos.
I don't like business.

1559
01:22:52,599 --> 01:22:55,760
- But you like money so...
- No. I like the result of business.

1560
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:59,200
- What does it mean by hating business?
- I don't like sitting in a meeting.

1561
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,240
Yeah. I get it. I get it.
You know what? I agree with that.

1562
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,160
Yeah. I like creating the video.

1563
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:05,639
But I think you also...

1564
01:23:05,639 --> 01:23:09,040
like there is a huge side of just creative
to a business.

1565
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,040
Hmm.

1566
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:12,679
I think the next trend for us is...
what I mean--

1567
01:23:12,679 --> 01:23:14,679
You never know the next trend.

1568

what the next thing is.

The thing at the back? I love it.

1607

<i>When I went to secondary school,
I started selling sweets to students</i>

1608

Vik is multi-faceted. Like, he's so smart,
but he's also a lot of fun.

<i>He's driven and he gets it done, man.</i>

1624
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:20,000
That's one thing I'll say about Vik.

1625
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,160
When he sets about a task,
he will get it done.

1626
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:33,719
{\an8}To go from a creator to a giant business,
you've gotta be a creator first.

1627
01:26:33,719 --> 01:26:36,599
{\an8}And a lot of people try to skip that step
or do it too early.

1628
01:26:36,599 --> 01:26:38,519
{\an8}I think for them, it's pretty easy

1629
01:26:38,519 --> 01:26:41,360
because they've got
seven influential people.

1630
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:44,240
<i>Then when you combine them together,
it's just cool what they do.</i>

1631
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:46,800
<i>And so, you naturally
add their products to the mix.</i>

1632
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,920
<i>I don't think there's that many people,</i>

1633
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:52,519
{\an8}<i>that have the ability to move product
like that on social media currently.</i>

1634

<i>It will go up in the future,</i>

1635
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:57,280
but you could count 'em on your hands,
the ones that can move product,

1636
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:00,480
and, obviously, they're one of them.
So it's very cool to see.

1637
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:03,719
The interesting one was
the paid for premium subscription service

1638
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:05,840

[Vik] <i>One of my favourite things about it</i>

1641
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:16,920
<i>is it's also a very powerful statement
about what we're able to build</i>

1642
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:21,519
<i>and how the platform we have now built
can exist outside of YouTube.</i>

1643
01:27:21,519 --> 01:27:24,000
<i>And I think it gives us
a very powerful position</i>

1644
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,280
to proving that we can drive
more revenue off YouTube

1645
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:30,519
than we can on YouTube,
which is fantastic.

<i>where we have to pay to watch them.</i>

1649
01:27:38,559 --> 01:27:43,639
<i>But the reason we made Side+
was to now fund the Sidemen videos.</i>

1650
01:27:43,639 --> 01:27:47,960
<i>And also, it's a chance for us
to interact with fans through giveaways.</i>

1651
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:51,719
<i>We can do meet and greets.
We can do the spending stuff.</i>

1652
01:27:51,719 --> 01:27:54,639

Sidemen can go further.

Oh, go on, people.

1725
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:28,240
Jeez. We are here in London
having the time of our lives.

1726
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:32,440
Jeez, Sidemen storming London.
It's mad.

1727
01:31:32,559 --> 01:31:33,759
[upbeat music playing]

1728
01:31:33,759 --> 01:31:35,400
Oi, oi, oi!

1729
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:42,559
We wanted people to know that we believe
this song should really be number one,

1730
01:31:42,559 --> 01:31:44,240
and we wanted to drive that energy

1731
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:46,559
{\an8}to try and generate
those moments on social

1732
01:31:46,559 --> 01:31:50,160
{\an8}where fans are creating TikToks,
they're creating Instagram stories,

1733
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:51,719
{\an8}<i>support "Christmas Drillings."</i>

1734
01:31:51,719 --> 01:31:53,200
{\an8}[man 1] Yeah!

1735
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:56,480
{\an8}[man 2] "Christmas Drillings"
pick up the run.

1736
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:58,320
{\an8}"Christmas Drillings" still number one.

1737
01:31:59,719 --> 01:32:02,240
{\an8}[man 3] It's everywhere.
You cannot miss this vibe.

1738
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:06,480
[Tobi] We got a mad bus
for this. It's crazy.

1739
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:08,800
We're trying to get our Christmas tune
to number one.

1740
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:10,759
Are you all ready? Shout Noel.

1741
01:32:10,759 --> 01:32:13,480

01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:16,920

[vocalising]

1745
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:26,840
Oh, this is mine.
Oi! What's going on? Sorry.

[man speaking indistinctly]

1748
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:36,840
Buy the song,
and don't get us arrested, please.

1749
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:40,280
We won't get the Christmas number one.
We'll be in prison.

1750
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:41,519
[man] Please clear the road.

1751
01:32:41,519 --> 01:32:44,120
[JJ] Please clear the road.

1752
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:47,400
- The feds are gonna lock us up.
- We'll totally get arrested.

1753
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:48,320
[laughs]

1754
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:51,840
- What do you think of Tottenham?
- [crowd] Shit!

1755
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,960
- What do you think is shit?
- [crowd] Tottenham!

1756
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:56,320
- Thank you.
- [crowd] That's all right.

1757
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:59,200
- [laughs] That's fucking amazing.
- Come on.

1758
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:00,639
[crowd cheering]

1759
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:17,639
{\an8}I'll put you out of your misery.
No surprises.

1760
01:33:17,639 --> 01:33:20,440
{\an8}because you guys are
the UK's Christmas number one!

1761
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:24,360
{\an8}- [cheering]
- [presenter] Come on! Congratulations!

1762
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:27,400
Getting that track into the charts alone
and doing what it did,

1763
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:28,880
was a huge community effort

1764
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:32,440
<i>which actually goes
very much against the industry,</i>

1765
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:34,320
<i>against capitalism in a sense,</i>

1766
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:37,120
<i>very much the community
versus the big corporates</i>

1767
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:41,000
<i>which I genuinely feel also resounds
really well with the Sidemen, in general.</i>

1768
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,880
<i>Like this community got this track
into the charts and beat Mariah Carey.</i>

1769
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:47,880
[laughs] 'Cause without a record label,
without pulling any strings,

1770
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:50,320
without getting on any playlists,
over the radios,

1771
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:54,360
without paying huge amounts of money
to do all the things you need to do,

1772
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:57,519
this was pure community.
And that's really special.

1773
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:04,679
{\an8}I don't think that the mainstream media
will ever accept online content creators.

1774
01:34:04,679 --> 01:34:07,599
{\an8}I think that there's still
a lot of rigidity

1775
01:34:07,599 --> 01:34:09,240
in the traditional media landscape.

1776
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:13,280
There's a tremendous lack of diversity
that really prevents the forward thinking

1777
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:18,440
that's required to see the innovation
and the potential in the online community.

1778
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:21,280
It's kind of like
old money versus new money. [laughs]

1779
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:25,040
And there's just... I see that distinction
so clearly sometimes in my job,

1780
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:28,599
where you see the, sort of,
very exciting digital frontier

1781
01:34:28,599 --> 01:34:32,480
and then this massive divide with this,
you know, with legacy media,

1782
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:34,639
that's just unwilling to change.

1783
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:37,719
[indistinct chattering]

1784
01:34:46,519 --> 01:34:49,280
[JJ] <i>I think we've all changed
over the ten years.</i>

1785
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:51,960
I think it's hard to say
who's changed the most.

1786
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:54,559
I mean, physically,
Ethan's changed the most.

1787
01:34:54,559 --> 01:34:56,599
[laughs]

1788
01:34:56,599 --> 01:35:01,200
Mentally, I think it's gotta be Ethan,
especially having a kid now.

1789
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:05,800
Yes, the first one of us to have a child.

1790
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:08,840
It's mental, you know, because...
say we're watching the TV

1791
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:12,080
<i>and I put a Sidemen video on
and she's gonna say, "Daddy's on the TV."</i>

1792
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:15,960
And she's gonna have to grasp the fact
that, "Yes, your dad does this."

1793
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:18,000
<i>People comment on that.</i>

1794
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,960
<i>It's gonna be really interesting.
Not sure how I'll work it out.</i>

1795
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:23,519
Hopefully, I've got a little bit of time
to buy. [laughs]

1796
01:35:23,519 --> 01:35:25,360
[Tobi] <i>When families get involved</i>

1797
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:29,120
<i>and you start having more and more babies
come in to the group,</i>

1798
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:31,759
<i>that's another responsibility
that you've gotta deal with.</i>

1799
01:35:31,759 --> 01:35:34,719
It's another thing to take your time,
and that is a priority,

1800
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:36,360
family should always be your priority.

1801
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:38,759
<i>But if there's one thing
that history's proven,</i>

1802
01:35:38,759 --> 01:35:40,200
<i>is that we're good at evolving.</i>

1803
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:41,480
[laughter]

1804
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:43,719
[Vik] <i>For me, I've always found it
really important</i>

1805
01:35:43,719 --> 01:35:46,080
to slowly build and create a world
for myself

1806
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:48,400
outside of content, outside of work.

1807
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:50,800
<i>That makes us better as content creators</i>

1808
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:53,599
<i>because it gives us
a wider experience of life</i>

1809
01:35:53,599 --> 01:35:55,160
<i>and that's the key, I think.</i>

1810
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:59,240
I think my advice for any future
YouTube groups

1811
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:02,360
is don't look at the Sidemen and go,
"I wanna be the next Sidemen."

1812
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:04,960
<i>You can look at it and take aspects, cool.</i>

1813
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:09,080
<i>But ours worked because it was natural.
We weren't trying to be someone else.</i>

1814
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:10,559
We literally were just us.

1815
01:36:10,559 --> 01:36:12,360
[laughter]

1816
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:14,320
I know a lot of people look up to me.

1817
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:17,480
So, I try to be the best human I can be.
But I'm a human.

1818
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:19,800
<i>So, I'm gonna have flaws.
I'm not gonna be perfect.</i>

1819
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:22,920
<i>You know, I feel like a lot of people
just through what I've done,</i>

1820
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:27,280
have been very inspired and influenced,
and it's so sick and cool to see.

1821
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:32,320
The interesting one to see will be
how YouTube and this space develops,

1822
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:33,639
and how we develop with it.

1823
01:36:33,639 --> 01:36:37,840
It's like a shift.
You have the television killing radio,

1824
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:40,800
and now you have
like the internet killing television.

1825
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:42,480
We're front and centre of that.

1826
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:47,360
<i>And there'll be a lot of massive things
that will occur in these next ten years</i>

1827
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,920
<i>that will make everyone realise
that has happened.</i>

1828
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,679
I think if we fail, we've had a stinker

1829
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:55,440
because it's like all there for taking.

1830
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:58,880
<i>We're all very well known.
We're as big as we can be.</i>

1831
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:02,080
<i>And we're full of like people
that are actually pretty switched on.</i>

1832
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:06,360
So, I think, we're destined for greatness.
But it's not really my forte.

1833
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:09,759
So if we are, we are.
If not, I'm happy with what we've got.
