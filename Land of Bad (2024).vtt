WEBVTT

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.160
The loading operations are
finish, half ready for take-off.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.480
There a problem, Sergeant?

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.840
No, sir...

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.840
Sorry, I was just, uh...

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.896
Get your shit together.
We lift off in five.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.720
Yes, sir.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.120
Hey, you're HALO
qualified, yeah?

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.160
HALO?

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.680
No, sir.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.600
Are we doing a HALO jump?

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.800
You'll be fine.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.640
I'd go Fruit Loops.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.840
My daughter loves them.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.000
Lieutenant Mitchell
reporting. I repeat.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.720
Lieutenant Mitchell reporting.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.920
Ah, fuck.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.800
Going after a CIA asset
that's been captured.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.480
The plan is to extract him
with minimal casualties.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.536
He was gathering intel on Alexander
Petrov, a Russian arms dealer

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.720
and former KGB.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.480
What's up?

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.600
That your family?

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.640
Nah, just a pic that
came with the helmet.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.680
Yeah. Wife and kids.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.440
Nice.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.160
Are those the new
5.11 tactical gloves?

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.480
You know the ones
with the Kevlar knit?

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.080
Yeah, yeah. Kevlar knit.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.480
Awesome.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.520
JTAC,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.400
just try to relax, okay?

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.600
Right back the other way on the
Euro and gets that one to go.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.680
And the whistle too...

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.520
That bad?

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.480
Yeah, that bad.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.880
Do you wanna talk about it?

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.640
Wanna hug?

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.800
We can hug.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.760
You need me?

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.080
Yeah, I wanted to ask
you something, but...

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.920
Okay. Coffee?

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.160
Sure.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.200
Okay.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.080
Yeah.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.800
Cool.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.240
So, uh,

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.136
you know the wedding's
coming up, right?

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.416
Yes, I do. Twenty-third.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.440
That's right.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.256
You're not gonna change
the date, are you?

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.760
What?

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.736
I've got everything organized.
I got the kids in place.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.696
I got the ex-wives in place.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.480
- Lucy will be out of the hospital.
- Reaper.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.120
I'm not going to
change the date. I,

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.040
um, actually wanted to talk
to you about something else.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.920
I wanted to ask...

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.040
Who moved my shit?

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.160
Airman

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.400
who moved my shit?

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.040
Huh?

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.840
Coffee pods.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.800
I... I don't know,
sir. I use the drip.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.680
Well, I can't trust a
word you say then, can I?

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.680
Yeah.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.480
I take the time.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.160
Every goddamn morning.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.800
I do it

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.360
for efficiency,

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.376
easy recognition,

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.680
and organization.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.480
Is it appreciated?

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.480
No.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.600
It is respected.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.240
I think not.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.480
But I do it

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.920
for the morale

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.800
of the squadron.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.480
You were saying?

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.840
Op starts in 15.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.320
Yeah, yeah. I thought you
wanted to talk about something.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.920
It can wait.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.120
Shit.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.720
You lose something?

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.600
Ah, just my cereal.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.520
Your what?

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.720
Froot Loops.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.920
I had a box of Froot Loops. I
don't know what I did with it.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.320
Jesus Christ, Air Force.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.800
Barely started this op and you're already
sweating about a box of Frosted Flakes.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.760
No, no. It was...
it was Froot Loops.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.360
Huh?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.200
Froot Loops, not Frosted Flakes.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.480
This kid for real?

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.600
Don't be an asshole.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.400
That's cute.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.920
Thanks, man.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.040
Fucking Fruit Loops.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.040
How old are you, Air Force?

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.440
Twenty-seven.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.480
Ah...

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.600
Bishop, how old's your
daughter now? Twenty?

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.280
You should set Air
Force up on a date.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.240
Yeah. I will shoot you in the
dick, Abell. I swear to God.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.680
No, honey.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.360
I can't.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.720
I can't come.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.160
'Cause I gotta be here

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.520
at work. Yeah.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.160
Look, just get
your sister to go.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.160
What about your mom?

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.320
All right. Well, why
don't you call...?

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.560
Oh, you called Judy? Uh

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.520
look, okay, okay.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.360
If it's only a couple
of things, that's fine.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.480
That's fine. But
right now, I gotta go

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.120
'cause I got a mission, yeah?

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.200
Zegler a little teardrop.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.896
You know I don't like that
shot in college, right?

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.080
It's made about thirt... yeah,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.576
it's made about 37
percent of the time.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.600
Fuck.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.360
Zegler just settled for a tough
floater on the first side of the floor.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.400
Guys.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.880
I got a favor to ask you.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.520
My wife is pregnant.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.680
While I'm on OP, if she goes into
labor, she's gonna call that phone.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.080
All right?

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.560
You need to answer it,

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.880
and you need to come and get me.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.160
Copy?

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.360
Thank you very much.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.800
And why don't we just keep this
volume down to a low level?

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.000
Because this is a
professional work environment.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.800
Now, now. Just because your team

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.280
delivered the biggest choke
in March Madness history,

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.800
doesn't mean the rest of us
can't still enjoy ourselves.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.320
It's about Lucy.
Virgil, it's important.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.240
I know.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.520
Notice the, uh,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.720
pseudofolliculitis

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:13.760
barbae hasn't

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.040
cleared up.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:15.920
Not yet, sir. No.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.280
Well, you just let me know
when you're ready to shave.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.160
I will, sir.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.200
All right.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.360
- Go, Vols!
- Go, Vols!

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.056
Warhawk, this is Blackbird
approaching drop zone.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.880
Headed to 15,000 feet.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.576
Six minutes to the DZ.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.440
Winds are five knots
and to the southeast.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.480
Skies are clear.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.840
Happy hunting.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:44.776
All right, boys. Six minutes.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.800
Here we go.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.120
Fruit Loop, now's the time
to be checking your weapon.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.720
I'm good.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.920
Not your Gameboy.
Your actual weapon.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.120
Hey, look, I'm in
charge of the drone. So

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.656
if we wind up in a
situation and I'm shooting,

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.240
we got big fucking problems.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.640
You're not wrong.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.360
You're not wrong. JTAC's only good for one
thing and that is... "Bringing the rain."

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.296
Is this your first
mission in theater, JTAC?

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.320
Second.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.880
But first with operators.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.480
What?

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.040
Hell, I'll say it. Um

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.440
we're about to head
into a shit storm.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.480
You still look like you kind of
need someone to wipe your ass.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.720
So just... do me a favor.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.480
Keep up and don't fuck up.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.200
Last thing we need in this op
is to have to save your ass.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.200
Nah, he's good.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Hey,

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.520
remember your training.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.776
Talk to the planes.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.560
When they start dropping bombs,
make sure it's on the bad guys.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.480
Yes, sir.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.440
You're not going to need these.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.000
This is a sterilized op.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.296
Be advised we are approaching...

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.400
All right, boys. Let's put our
masks on. Let's get to work.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.360
Hey, JTAC,

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.120
this might sound stupid but
don't forget to breathe, yeah?

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.576
Stay on your comms.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.080
When that hits 3,000,

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.440
deploy your chute.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.176
It's just the same as airborne,

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.160
only way fucking higher.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.440
Good to go.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.840
I'll see you fuckers
on the beach.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.520
Yee-haw.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:43.880
Hey,

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.440
walk in the park.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.600
Fuck.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.040
You good?

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.800
Let's go. Come on. Get up.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.520
That ridge.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.640
Four clicks by 0800.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.720
Let's go. Let's move.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.720
All right.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.240
Sir,

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.280
Thank you, Miller.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.560
Okay, team has landed.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.440
Operators are en route.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.160
The drone is ten mics
out from rendezvous point

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.560
and Warhawk is switching comms.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.880
This carriage is about
to turn into a pumpkin.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.560
This is not my chair.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:22.720
Yes, it is.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.816
No, it is not.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.920
Oh, my god, Reaper, I
did not take your chair.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.040
I know you didn't take my chair.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.320
It will be these commie
assholes from Shadow Flight.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.240
You finished?

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.600
No, I'm not.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.520
Eat a bag of dicks.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.680
Now I'm finished.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:41.760
Okay.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.880
All right, let's take
this lady to the dance.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.400
Playboy 06, this is
Reaper 1-0 checking in...

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.760
You have 1 MQ-9 in the air.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:20.480
1 by BLU 118 on board. Eight
hours of playtime ahead.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.736
Reaper 1-0, this is Playboy
0-6. Stand by for grid, over.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.400
Roger. Standing by.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.320
Grid as follows,

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.880
…November, Victor,
7, Niner, 5-7-1-8.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.560
That's a friendly grid.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.120
Roger, Playboy. I have
visual on friendly grid.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.560
I am your eyes in the sky
and the bringer of doom.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.680
Over.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.600
Reaper is airborne. Our
location is confirmed.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:44.720
What's the ordinance?

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.880
Two hellfire's and
a BLUE-118, sir.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.600
Lose the sir shit.
I work for a living.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:50.840
It's Sugar or Sug.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.200
All right.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.720
Makes him feel old.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.640
He is old.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.120
Thanks, Air Force.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.160
Hey, JTAC.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.000
What rock did they
find you under?

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.880
In Guam on a training exercise.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.600
Missed the flight out.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.400
That was

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.040
nine hours ago.

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:37.920
How'd you miss the flight?

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.720
I had some stomach issues.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.400
Wait.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.840
You're here 'cause
you had the shits?

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.680
Well, I hope you got
that all cleared out.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.120
You shit your pants on an op,

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.040
that stain will
follow you for life.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.880
Did you get briefed?

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.440
Yeah, but I'm a little confused.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.480
What about?

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.480
Well, I'm not tier one.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.800
Yet he walks amongst us.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.200
I thought operators don't go
out without tier one personnel.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.240
We don't.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.360
So why am I here?

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.920
A JSOC asset disappeared
two weeks ago.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:14.897
Believed to be kidnapped.

00:15:14.921 --> 00:15:18.000
We've got intel on
a possible locale.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.600
So this is a rescue op?

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.640
Potentially.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:22.520
Ah.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.840
You can never keep up
with these CIA spooks.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.920
Either way... here we are.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.800
So to answer your question

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.400
no, you shouldn't be here.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:32.640
And, yes,

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.920
Delta doesn't usually go out
without their tier one personnel.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.120
And, yes,

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.760
if our guy is here,

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.840
then we'll go in
and fucking get him.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.880
Translation

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.120
step up your game.

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.440
I need someone to cover.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:15:59.800
Yeah.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.160
I gotta check in with Lucy.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.320
How's she doing?

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.480
She's fantastic.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.240
Got the baby brain
going on though.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.120
I gotta repeat
everything five times.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.280
It's amazing.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.000
Absolutely huge.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.800
Got the same thing
about this wedding.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.120
Uh, it's understandable.

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.520
There's a lot of detail.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.520
You think about it.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.720
A wedding is probably the greatest
social ritual humanity has.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:25.680
You know,

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.520
most important day of your life.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:28.880
Might as well get it right.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.400
You're only going to do it once.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.920
Reaper, you've been
married four times.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.640
Yeah, that's just me though.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.200
I'm a romantic.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.080
What did you want
to ask me before?

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.200
Oh, I...

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.240
Hold that thought.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:42.440
Thank you, Miller.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.480
Reaper.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:03.880
Hey, what's up?

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.360
Ah, this fucking frag
is a pain in my ass.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.200
Thought you got that patched up.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.240
I did.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.800
So why are you still
bitching about it?

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.240
There's still a fucking
hole in my leg, asshole.

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.080
What happened?

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.440
I.E.D.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.640
Some kid triggered it
from half a click out.

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.920
We never stood a chance.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.600
Therein lies the
problem, Fruit Loop.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.040
All this tech, it takes

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.680
the human element
out of warfare.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.680
And what happens when
all that shit fails?

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:39.880
Well...

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.280
Well, what?

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.320
I don't know. I mean,

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.880
I think this tech saves lives.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.400
In a way, it's takes the
barbaric nature out of it.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.640
Barbaric nature?

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.600
Lipstick on a pig.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:18:00.280
You really think you dropping a bomb on 50 people
is any better than us shooting them in the head?

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:01.520
No.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.600
No. War is barbaric.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.360
It ain't never gonna
fucking change.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:06.760
It already has.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.360
Listen up, Fruit Loop.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.800
Let me tell you a story.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.760
You can fight with all your robots and
your reapers and cell phones you want.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.760
The end of the day,

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.800
when the technology fails

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:18.640
and all your

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.440
your batteries and your bullets
and your bombs run out, you know,

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.400
and the fucking sun explodes,

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.840
war comes down to one
very simple thing.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.040
And that's man killing man.

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.920
Just takes one shit day to
change your whole perspective.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.720
That's a fact.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.760
Yeah.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.800
Welcome to the land of bad.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.360
Fucking great story, man.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.680
Really fucking good,
rich and compelling.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:23.480
What do you got?

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.800
I got movement.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.560
Hundred meters.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.400
Just the other side
of those rocks.

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:40.520
I need eyes over that ridge.
Hundred meters northeast.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.320
Reaper 1-0, this is Playboy 0-6.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.920
Got suspicious movement a hundred meters
northeast of our position. Can you check it out?

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.040
Roger that, Playboy. Standby.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.480
Hundred meters southeast.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:04.560
Got good handshake.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.000
Reaper 1-0, can you zoom in?

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.440
Copy that.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.920
Yeah, oh, that's sexy.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.400
Pan left, 50 meters.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.000
Pan left, 50 meters.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.200
What the fuck?

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.776
Reaper, I'm hollow, over.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.200
Roger. Standby.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.160
Systems malfunction.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.520
Goddamn piece of shit.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.120
Playboy, we have a systems
malfunction on the bird.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.200
Copy that. Is the pod inop?

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:52.200
That is an a-firm, Playboy. We got to
get this piece of shit back to base.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.800
Is another bird available?

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:55.800
That is a negative.

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.280
We'll fix this one up and
get it back to you stat.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.480
Reapers down. No
other UAV's available.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.640
Broken Reaper, huh?

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.800
Ain't that some fuckin' irony?

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.536
Looks like we're gonna have to clear this ridge
the old-fashioned way. Abell, you're on point.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:12.080
Copy.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:12.760
Bishop,

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.440
you're left.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:14.600
Copy.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.160
What's the rest of
our air support?

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.320
Hornet's on standby.
Thirty mikes out.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:19.760
What do you want me to do?

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:20.800
Nothing.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.080
I got nothing on my end.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.080
Same here.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.000
Looks clear.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.320
Wait.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.760
Wait, I've got movement.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.720
Ten meters.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.280
Oh, for fuck's sake.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.640
It's a fucking oink oink.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.080
What the hell's an oink oink?

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.160
A fucking pig, dumb-ass.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.040
Pretty sure you got a picture
of her in your wallet.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.800
Fucker.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.200
This is serious
bad guy lair shit.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.800
Got two tangos on the bridge.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.096
A third on the far right.

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.360
Other side of the tent.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.240
See a Starbucks down there?

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.520
I see number four on the
lower part of the S-bend road.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.360
Let's push down.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.200
Okay. Clear.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.520
Clear.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:31.200
Okay. We're gonna call
this OP1. Air Force,

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.480
set up up top.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.560
Abell, you stay put.
Set up your hindsight.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.200
Bishop, you're with me.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.120
We're gonna wrap
around southeast.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.336
Hooah.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:43.920
You good?

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.680
Yeah, I think so.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.240
Okay. Go forth and conquer.

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:39.680
All right, gents.

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:40.840
Sit tight.

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:44.760
Call out what you see. Want a head count
on that compound before we move on it.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.160
Sug?

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.840
When can we get a
nice gig in Hawaii?

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.080
Sick of swamp crotch.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:05.920
I don't think they'd allow you
back in Hawaii since last time.

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:07.800
That was

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.640
one time.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.160
Piece of shit. Fucking.

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.560
Got movement.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.240
All right, this sure
looks like our guy.

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.760
Bishop, can you confirm?

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.880
Yeah, that's Petrov all right.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.160
Okay,

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.000
if he's here,

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.160
the asset's gotta be close.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.120
Thunderbolt Squadron?

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.080
No, it's not.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.720
I'm sorry I can't
do that for you.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.640
You're gonna have to
call the operator back.

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.880
If you ask for extension 141,
that's Thunderbolt. Uh-huh.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.560
Yeah, no problem.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.320
Guys

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.000
what the fuck?

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.640
What's the problem, Captain?

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.200
I asked you to keep
an ear on this phone.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.760
Some smartass turned
the goddamn ringer off.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.040
Why don't you turn it back on?

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.240
I have.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.720
Is your wife actually
in labor, Captain?

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:40.680
On the precipice, sir.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.920
Water's broken?

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:44.880
Impending.

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:46.840
Having any of those, uh,

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.840
contractions?

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.440
Well, since you asked,

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.480
right now,

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.040
40 mics apart.

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.880
Last night, she was tooting like

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.280
a bugler at a
Gettysburg reenactment.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.160
Currently, her cervix is

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.496
two centimeters dilated
and starting to yawn.

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.120
All right, that is
too much information.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.200
Yes, it is, sir.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.680
Airmen, for the love of God,
make sure that phone's turned on.

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.320
Thank you.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.640
Contact.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.200
Multiple vehicles
inbound. Eleven o'clock.

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:48.640
Oh, Petrov is on the move.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.160
Who the hell are these guys?

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.120
Identify yourselves!

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.160
Don't know.

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.800
Local militia?

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.400
Kinda looks like Abu Sayyaf.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.040
Bishop, can you confirm?

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.480
Yeah, I can't tell.

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.280
More guys with guns.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.200
Sure as shit ain't taking
this compound 'til they leave.

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.440
Check out the dude getting out
the left side of the lead vehicle.

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:27.200
Tell me that doesn't
look like Saeed Hashimi.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.680
Fuck.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:31.840
Who's that?

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.080
Head of Abu Sayyaf.

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.080
Sure he's here to buy guns.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.400
Keep your eyes open.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.840
Guns on safety.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.280
JTAC, what's the
status of our air?

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.560
Reaper still down,
Hornet on standby.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:49.920
You want it airborne?

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.160
Negative.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.520
Sit tight. Let me work
on a new game plan.

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.080
Yo,

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:07.200
drone's fixed.

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.560
Handover in five.

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:09.920
I'm ready.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.640
Fuck.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.200
Playboy,

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:30.360
this is Reaper 1-0, back
on station. Checking in.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.760
Requesting permission
to establish overhead.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.720
Copy that. Good to
have you back, Reaper.

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.800
Grid is as follows,

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:47.640
November, Victor,
1-1-4-8-7-6-3-5. Over.

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.320
Copy grid, Playboy.

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:52.920
I have contact.

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:57.040
Open circular compound, one
large concrete structure,

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:00.360
and a road heading
north crossing a dam.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.160
Confirm target area.

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.240
Roger that, you have
target area in sight.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:11.120
I didn't know Hashimi
was in bed with Petrov.

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.920
Oh, Hashimi's a terrorist.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.400
He's got to buy his
guns from somewhere.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:17.880
Come.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.480
Come here.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.920
The miss doesn't look
too thrilled about it.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.320
Yeah, this guy's
definitely a creeper.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.200
She's getting stranger
danger vibes for sure.

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:37.320
Hashimi and Petrov
sitting in a tree.

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.600
K-I-S-S...

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.240
Fuck.

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:42.800
Go away!

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.360
Run! Run, run, run.

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.400
Oh, fuck.

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.576
Take him!

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.600
Run!

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.576
What the fuck, Sugar?
What are we doing?

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.080
Warhawk, this is Alpha 1.

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:59.480
Have hostiles engaging with
civilians. Requesting updated.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.040
Make him see.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.600
Allahu Akbar!

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:20.560
Fuck me.

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.320
Oh fuck...

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:26.520
Motherfucker!

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:29.520
Jesus Christ!

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.200
Petrov,

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.560
Papa!

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:05.240
Fuck this, Sugar, I ain't watching
this asshole lob off the kid's head.

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:06.280
Papa!

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.680
Kinney, stand by for
potential diversion.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:15.056
Reaper, we need weapons effects between
the compound and the tent. Over.

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:18.160
Reaper 1-0. One by
hellfire missile, copied.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:22.680
Papa!

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:28.240
Abell, Bishop, you got a shot, you take
it. Kinney, drop that fucking bomb.

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.800
Reaper, you are cleared hot!
Say again, you are cleared hot!

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:31.840
Copied.

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:34.880
Target acquired.

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:41.640
Weapon's away.
Impact 30 seconds.

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.360
No! Papa!

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.480
Don't have thirty.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.200
Run!

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.800
Run, kid. Run!

00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:22.720
Guys?

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.600
It's a fucking cave entrance.

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:44.120
Kinney, you've got hostiles directly below
you. Do not move. Do not even breathe.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:48.040
Abell, Bishop,

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.760
I need sights on targets.

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:55.520
Abell, you taking center. Bishop,
extreme left. I'm on extreme right.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.520
On one...

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.400
In position.

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:04.760
On one.

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:06.120
Three

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:06.680
two,

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.200
one,

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.200
Kinney!

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:29.720
Fuck!

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:34.640
Shit. Abell, you've got five
hostiles on your six. Fifty meters.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.536
Bishop, move. On me!

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:46.560
All right, Abell.

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:05.160
Kinney, I need...

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.040
Stay still, asshole.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.176
A little help here, fellas!

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.560
Trying, buddy.

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:36.440
Kinney, I need you to lay down
some cover fire for Abell.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.000
Sug...

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:47.520
Yeah.

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:48.560
We got a situation.

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:49.080
No shit.

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:52.160
We got another situation.
RPG twelve o'clock. Incoming!

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:57.800
Motherfucker!

00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.320
Motherfucker!

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.080
I got you, man. I got you.

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:25.880
Okay.

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:28.680
You're good, man.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.601
No, you're good, man. You're
good. You're good. I got you.

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.360
Where's the med kit?

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.480
I'm gonna get you fixed up.

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.240
Come on, man.
Where's the med kit?

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:42.680
Kinney.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.280
Kinney.

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:46.736
Abell, Abell. No, no, no.

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:48.520
Fuck, fuck. Oh, fuck!

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.640
Abell is down. Abell is down.

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:53.840
Hello?

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.680
Oh, fuck.

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:01.240
Oh, fuck. Alpha 1, this Playboy.

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:01.816
Kinney,

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:02.840
listen to me.

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:08.040
We are taking heavy fire
from two two-man RPG teams.

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.840
I need some bombs
down there now!

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.640
Wait, wh-what about Abell?

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.280
Abell is dead.

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:17.520
He's dead. I need you to stay focused,
Sergeant. Get yourself together.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:19.880
Oh, fuck.

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.736
Reaper, we're taking RPG
fire on the southeast side

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:56.336
of the compound. Two hundred
meters south of my position.

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.200
Give me the biggest thing
you got. Cleared hot.

00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:00.560
Copy that, Playboy. We
have eyes on the target.

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:03.840
1 by Blu 118.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.200
Weapons away.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.160
Impact 20 seconds.

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.520
Where's that bomb, Sergeant?

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:14.920
Twenty seconds!

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:23.920
RPG incoming!

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:27.840
Fuck! Sugar?

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.600
Sugar? Bishop!

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.240
Oh, shit.

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:48.280
Fuck!

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.200
You got eyes on him?

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.560
Lost him in the smoke.

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:56.560
Fuck.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:57.680
Did he pop the smoke?

00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:58.720
I don't know.

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:10.520
Playboy, do you copy?

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:11.400
I see him.

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.480
Stay with him.

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:32.760
Reaper? Reaper, you there?

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.040
Reaper?

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.200
Reaper, you there?

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.160
We're here, Playboy.

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.600
Give me the status of your team.

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:01.520
Uh,

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.120
KIA.

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.640
Okay, Playboy, let's

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:10.600
do this by the numbers.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:12.920
Confirm your current
grid location.

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:14.880
Yeah.

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.240
Uh,

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:29.120
I'm headed northeast. November,
Romeo, 2-7-6-0-niner-3-2-2.

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:30.480
I'm, uh...

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:32.760
I'm approx

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.920
five clicks from the evac point.

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:42.440
I need you to scan forward 500 meters
and make sure the area is clear.

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:43.840
Copy, Playboy. We got you.

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:47.080
Scanning forward
500 meters. Standby.

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.680
Yeah, area's clear.

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:52.720
Area looks clear.
You're good to move.

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:01.360
Playboy, do you copy?

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:05.720
Playboy?

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.240
What's he doing? Is he moving?

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.320
He's freaking out.

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:24.040
You gotta calm him down.

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.680
Hey, Playboy. Good news.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:33.200
Helicopter is inbound to the evac
point. The cavalry is on the way.

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.920
You gotta get your
ass on the move, son.

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:45.760
You got to move, man. Let's go.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:46.880
Come on, soldier.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.520
Get up and go.

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.400
Here we go. All right.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.320
You scan forward. I've got him.

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:55.480
Scanning forward.

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:56.800
Tell me what you see.

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.240
Reaper,

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:32.680
I think I'm hearing a truck.

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:33.720
He's right.

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:35.560
I have contact from the west.

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.880
Truck on the road, half a click.

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.800
I have contact from the east.

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:43.880
Looks like they're converging
on Playboy's position.

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:48.040
Playboy, be aware. You have
converging targets east and west.

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:05.696
How much ordinance
do you have left?

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:09.080
One by hellfire. Air to
ground 114. Standing by.

00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:10.896
You want those hornets airborne?

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:12.120
Negative.

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:15.360
Okay, Playboy, tally. Eyes on
target. What you want to do?

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:17.600
Keep eyes on it.

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.320
Roger that. Standing by.

00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:46.680
Reaper, do you have
eyes on hostiles?

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.760
Confirmed hostiles from
the east are armed.

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:50.800
Are they Abu Sayyaf?

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:52.440
They've got weapons.
Safe to assume.

00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:58.680
Playboy, you copy?

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:00.200
Can't talk right now.

00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:12.800
Ah, for fuck's sake.
Playboy, Playboy.

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.440
Canine coming your way.

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:18.640
You gotta be shitting me.

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:23.840
Git.

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.320
Fuck, Playboy.

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:40.800
Buffalo Bill has dismounted. He
is approaching your position.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:42.520
Looks like he's
coming towards Lassie.

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:50.040
Do not move.

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:57.760
Playboy,

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:02.360
Buffalo Bill is above your
position. Do not move.

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:18.760
Okay, Playboy. Looks
like Lassie's going home.

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:26.840
Buffalo Bill has remounted.

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:29.600
Hostiles are leaving
the party. Stand by.

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:48.120
Goddammit.

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:52.080
Playboy,

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:56.240
Buffalo Bill and his buddy
are gone. The truck is gone.

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.360
You are clear tracking
500 meters to your north.

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:05.160
There's a path up that
ridge on your one o'clock.

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:33.520
Hey, Playboy,

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:36.040
how you holding up?

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:41.600
I'm all right.

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.160
Where are you from, man?

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:48.920
Ohio.

00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:51.440
No shit.

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:52.880
Me, too.

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:54.240
Brook Park.

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:56.560
Middleburg Heights.

00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.480
We're basically
fucking neighbors.

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:00.680
O-H.

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:03.680
I-O.

00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:05.680
Fellow Buckeye.

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.200
Get home much?

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:10.520
Yeah.

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:12.480
Yeah, I was just there.

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:16.080
Had to bury my father.

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:22.640
Oh, man. Sorry to hear.

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:25.080
Yeah, it's okay.

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:27.520
Were you guys close?

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000
Yeah.

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:35.680
Yeah, he was a good guy.

00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:50.120
In Sweet Sixteen news,
the fucking Buckeyes

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.360
just shit the bed against VCU.

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:54.800
First round.

00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:56.920
Trying to depress me more?

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.000
Sorry, man.

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:03.400
Hey, you ever got up to
Mama Santas on Mayfield?

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:05.320
Are you kidding me?

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:08.800
I lived at that place
during high school.

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:10.360
Fucking great.

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:14.600
I know, right? I met my
first wife there in '95.

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:16.160
Oh, yeah?

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:17.680
Yeah. We met in line.

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:20.280
We both ordered stromboli.

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:22.400
Who the fuck orders stromboli?

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:23.800
I know, right?

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:25.480
I thought it was meant to be.

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:26.800
And it was.

00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:29.640
Right up until it wasn't,

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:30.880
you know?

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:33.920
My current wife hates the shit.

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:35.920
She jealous?

00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:37.840
Nah, man, worse

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:39.720
she's vegan.

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:41.800
Ah, man. That is worse.

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:44.600
How do you know if
someone's a vegan?

00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:46.720
How?

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.520
They will tell you.

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:54.720
You're getting really close now, man.
Just keep up the pace. Good work.

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:29.920
ETA on the helo?

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:33.680
Playboy 0-6, this
is Blackbird 2-5,

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:34.760
approaching LZ from east.

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:36.400
ETA three mikes, over.

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:37.440
Copy.

00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:43.080
Reaper, how's my path to the LZ?

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:44.400
Clear.

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:45.760
Path is clear.

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:48.160
Time to get the hell
out of dodge, Playboy.

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:19.720
Thanks for the eyes, Reaper.

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:21.160
Happy to do it.

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:24.320
Hey, drop me a line next
time you're in Vegas.

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:27.160
I have a solid hookup
for Disney on Ice.

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:28.880
You lost me.

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:30.200
I might pass on that,

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:32.680
but I'm at Nellis all the time.

00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:34.856
I'm here, man. Call CENTCOM.

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.840
Raven Squadron. Eddie Grim.

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:39.200
Just ask for Reaper.

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:40.560
Will do.

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:45.680
Blackbird 2-5, I have a visual.
LZ is clear for extract.

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:48.280
Marking position with I-R.

00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:57.320
Roger that, Playboy. I
have your position marked.

00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:30.336
Contact! I'm hit! I'm hit!

00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:31.840
Playboy, are you injured?

00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:34.417
Negative!

00:52:34.441 --> 00:52:35.600
Must have hit my plate.

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:45.096
Reaper, hostiles, 100 meters
east. Two hundred meters south.

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:48.480
Contact! Blackbird. I have
multiple targets around the LZ.

00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:05.640
Contact, Blackbird. Three more
hostiles on the west ridge.

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:07.240
Small arms and an RPG.

00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:08.560
Better move your ass.

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:13.520
RPG!

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:24.040
Shit!

00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:27.400
Blackbird, can you stay in the
area until we can find a secure LZ?

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:30.456
Negative, Playboy.
LZ is too hot.

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:32.280
Back to you as fast as we can.

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:47.720
Shit!

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:50.896
Reaper, west ridge.

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:52.080
Contact, Playboy.

00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:53.880
Three more trucks right through.

00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:08.400
Reaper, need the bomb
300 meters to the west.

00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:10.080
Cleared hot!

00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:11.480
Roger that, Playboy.

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:13.560
Tally. Eyes on target.

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:16.040
Stay where you are, assholes.

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:20.000
Stay where you are, assholes.

00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:31.360
Weapon away. Impact 20 seconds.

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:46.920
Target is down. Now get
the fuck out of there.

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:49.016
Fuck! Taking fire.

00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:49.897
This ain't done.

00:54:49.921 --> 00:54:52.120
Got another truck
coming in from the west.

00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:54.880
Jesus Christ, I'm pinned down.

00:54:57.640 --> 00:54:59.616
How are they seeing me?

00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:00.480
It's his strobe!

00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:03.040
They must have night vision.
He's gotta turn his strobe off.

00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:04.776
It's your strobe, Playboy.
Turn off your strobe.

00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:07.320
Taking fire from the east.
Drop everything you have.

00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:09.640
Playboy, I am Winchester.
I'm out of bombs.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.360
ETA on the hornets is two mikes.

00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:18.176
Playboy... this is Hornet 1.

00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:19.097
Entering point out level.

00:55:19.121 --> 00:55:21.280
I'm coming in on an
east west heading.

00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:23.720
Roger that, Hornet 1.

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:25.656
I'm 200 meters north
of target grid.

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:27.640
Keep all fire south
of target grid.

00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:29.400
I say again, all fire south.

00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:31.680
Copy that. Be advised
this will be danger close.

00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:33.160
Yes, yes. Cleared hot.

00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:34.160
Copy.

00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:36.240
Three, two, one!

00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:57.480
Shit!

00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:59.120
Still taking fire from west!

00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:03.240
Copy, Playboy. Coming
around for another run.

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:11.120
Fuck!

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:15.480
Fuck this!

00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:17.360
What do you want, Airman?

00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:18.776
- Yeah, I'm doing a Starbucks run.
- Moving!

00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:20.160
Colonel Packett is springing.

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:20.856
A what?

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:21.577
Starbucks.

00:56:21.601 --> 00:56:23.096
Have you lost your mind?

00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:24.120
Airman, leave!

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:26.280
Eyes on that hornet.

00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:28.496
Give me some fire
on the west ridge.

00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:29.760
You're cleared hot.

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.800
Confirm. West or east?

00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:33.080
West! West!

00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:36.256
Copy that. This one is
going to be danger close.

00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:37.880
We still do not
have visual on you.

00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:40.616
It's fine. Just drop
it! You're cleared hot!

00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:42.520
Be advised, this
is danger close.

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:03.240
Altitude.

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:04.280
Altitude.

00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:05.360
Pull up.

00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:07.240
Pull up.

00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:10.320
Playboy, I am Winchester.

00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:12.120
Hornet 1 is RTB.

00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:14.800
Copy that.

00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:17.280
Good shooting.

00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:21.016
How's it looking, Reaper?

00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:23.720
Playboy, from what we
can see, it looks clear.

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:26.680
These fuckers know
we're out there now, so

00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:29.680
do not discount any surprises.

00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:32.056
We got another LZ?

00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:33.200
There's a clearing

00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:35.880
two clicks northeast
of your position.

00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:37.600
You're not gonna like it though.

00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:40.280
You say northeast?

00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:43.160
A-firm, Playboy.

00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:48.160
Northeast is up a
big fucking hill.

00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:56.200
I know, man. I told you,
you weren't gonna like it.

00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:59.320
I'm sorry, but that is the
closest LZ option we have.

00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:20.920
Playboy, the helo is airborne.

00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:24.280
ETA to the alternate
LZ is 90 mikes.

00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:27.320
You copy?

00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:28.840
Yeah, I'm here.

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:31.480
How you doing, man?

00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:34.120
Pretty gassed.

00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:36.760
Yeah, no doubt.

00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:38.680
Hang in there, okay?

00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:45.680
Sorry about the
failed evac, man.

00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:47.600
Now you know.

00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:51.840
Don't trust Air Force Captains.
Traditionally, we are full of shit.

00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:54.720
Captain?

00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:55.520
Yeah.

00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:57.880
You said you met your
first wife in '95.

00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:02.240
Yeah, I am old as shit. I
should be a general by now.

00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:07.240
I got three ex-wives. I got eight kids. I
got a new wife. I got a new kid on the way.

00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:10.320
I need the active duty bonuses.

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:14.240
If I go out from Captain, they'll
make me an instructor, so fuck that.

00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:17.360
You fly fixed wings
before the birds?

00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:20.896
That is a very long
story, my friend.

00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:24.200
But, yes, originally, I
did sign up to be a pilot.

00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:28.240
But apparently, the
Air Force thought

00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:31.240
my responses to authority
were not normal.

00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:33.480
So that goat got fucked.

00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:35.120
Subtle.

00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:38.480
What happened?

00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:41.416
Well, I shot my big mouth off,

00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:45.520
and I found myself
reassigned to USAF-SF

00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:48.680
guarding shit in the middle
of nowhere for 20 years.

00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:52.720
Eareckson Base in the Aleutian,
Pine Gap in Australia...

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.640
Playboy, do you copy?

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:08.400
Playboy, do you copy?

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:10.800
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.320
What happened?

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:16.640
Slid halfway down
a fucking mountain.

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:18.320
Oh, fuck, man. You okay?

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:19.360
You hurt?

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.720
Yeah. Just my pride.

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.616
Uh, Reaper, I've got
movement in front of Playboy.

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:30.040
One hundred meters northwest.

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:31.080
Zoom in.

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:33.040
Three armed hostiles.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.896
Playboy, you have three
hostiles heading your way.

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.080
Find cover.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:39.400
Find cover.

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:41.680
Fuck.

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.280
Shit.

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:09.696
Scan forward. Keep me with him.

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:10.720
Copy.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.200
Got him?

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.440
I'm looking. I'm looking.

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:54.600
Fuck.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:10.240
I got him.

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:11.680
He's heading downstream.

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:37.080
God fucking dammit!

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.480
Get me the colonel.

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:43.720
Yeah.

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:46.760
Keep looking.

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:48.840
I lost him under the canopy.

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:49.920
Fuck.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.680
Reaper, what's the sitrep?

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.480
This mission has gone
to shit, Colonel.

01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:58.840
I got an op who's been taken.

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.400
We are 12 hours in.

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:05.480
I'm Winchester, but we cannot leave the
target area because we have the only eyes.

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:09.680
Requesting permission to stay in the
chair until we get the soldier home.

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:16.880
How you feeling? Are
you feeling sharp?

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:17.840
Oh yeah.

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:19.920
Sharp as an elephant's ass.

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:21.720
Staff Sergeant?

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:22.920
I'm good, sir.

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.440
Okay, Eddie. Stay in the chair.

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:29.400
Get it done, you two.

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.120
Fuck you.

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:05.480
Come on, Playboy.

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.440
Come on. Talk to me.

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:09.400
Oh, shit.

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:10.440
You got him?

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:13.896
It's all radio chatter
about the JSOC asset.

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:14.560
Who?

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:16.240
The reason those guys are there,

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:18.160
not confirmed,

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:20.256
but one says Borneo,
the other Yemen.

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:21.280
Yemen?

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:24.000
That's halfway around the
fucking world. You shitting me?

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:25.776
Who's saying that?

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:29.096
Reading between the
lines with CIA or DIA.

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.120
Man.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:32.560
Alphabet soup motherfuckers!

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:35.280
You can't trust a word they say.

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:53.320
Hands!

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Hands!

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:56.280
Hands!

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:08.640
Are you injured?

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:14.560
Look at me.

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:17.200
I thought you were dead.

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:19.160
Here.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:21.440
Drink this. Drink. Drink. Drink.

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:25.120
Here. Put that on, okay?

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:26.440
Okay?

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:29.920
An RPG exploded
on your position.

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:31.880
Near,

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:33.160
not on.

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:35.160
Listen.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:37.040
Bishop got captured.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:39.120
He's injured pretty bad.

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:40.440
I gotta go.

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.520
We gotta go back and get him.

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:43.280
So,

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:44.800
grab what you can, okay? Here.

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.120
Take this. Here.

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:48.016
Put them in here.
Put them in here.

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:49.040
Here take this.

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:50.880
Come on.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.640
You following me, Sergeant?

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.240
Hey. Look,

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:55.560
I get it.

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:57.480
This is not where
you want to be,

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.760
but you got to dig, okay?

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:00.400
It's not here. It's
not here. It's here.

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.120
Bishop's in trouble.

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.560
We gotta go back and get him.

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:05.240
Okay.

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:20.920
You can still shoot, can't you?

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.160
Yeah.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.120
Let's go.

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.216
Still have your battery?

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.640
No, I lost it in the fall.

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:12.400
Let me see your knife.

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:14.560
What for?

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:17.760
I'm gonna call Warhawk.

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:20.280
With a water bottle?

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:53.880
Come on, you piece of shit.

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:57.000
Reaper, this is Playboy.

01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:58.880
Playboy, where the fuck are you?

01:07:58.920 --> 01:07:59.737
I'm with Alpha one.

01:07:59.761 --> 01:08:01.136
We're headed back
to the initial AO.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.800
No, no, no, no. Negative.
Negative, Playboy.

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:06.480
We have Intel the
asset has been found.

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.536
We're not going for the asset.

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:10.560
Say again?

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:13.736
We're not going for the asset. One of our team
members was captured. We're going in to get him.

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:17.240
Playboy, a QRF is being assembled. Hold
your position until they're deployed.

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:18.680
Negative, Reaper.
There's no time.

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:21.096
Get on the horn with CJSOTF,
and let them know our sitrep.

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:24.656
We're gonna need planes on standby.
ETA to target area is 6-0 mikes.

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:26.080
We'll confirm grid then. Over.

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:27.760
What direction you
heading, Playboy?

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:28.880
Give me your bearing.

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:32.480
Playboy?

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:33.560
Lost comms.

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:34.600
Fuck!

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:46.680
Connect me to CJSOTF.

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:51.120
Well, I know it's unusual, Eileen.
Just fucking connect me, okay?

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:10.880
So where is he?

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:12.360
No idea.

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:15.800
What's the plan?

01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:18.640
Drop some bombs,
create a diversion,

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:19.920
go in and get him.

01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:22.080
Kill anyone that
gets in our way.

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.360
Where do you want the bombs?

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:33.480
You're the JTAC. You tell me.

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:41.960
Probably the best place would be along
those cave entrances on this ridge line.

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.400
Space them out 15 minutes
apart while we go in.

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.200
Sound good?

01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:50.400
Sounds good.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.880
Find Bishop, make our move
when the first strike hits.

01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:57.176
Second strike should
hold their attention.

01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:58.400
And the last one?

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:01.680
Mass effect.

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:04.160
Let's turn those
caves inside out.

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:06.800
Fuckin' A, kid.

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:08.680
Fuckin' A.

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:10.920
Yeah, I'm here. What do you got?

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.360
B1 full payload?
That will do the job.

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:14.440
I will confirm

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:17.360
the 9 line with Bone
0-1 when received.

01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:18.720
Roger.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.440
B1 in the air, Colonel.

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:22.880
Copy that. Nice work.

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:26.440
Reaper, this is Playboy.

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:27.800
Copy, Playboy. I'm here.

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:31.136
Okay. Game plan is to use CAS to
strike a set of cave structures

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:33.200
to the north of the
compound as a diversion.

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:37.000
I need three attacks spaced approx
15 mikes apart starting at 1100.

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:38.280
Eleven hundred. Mark that.

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:39.720
First strike, 1100.

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:43.120
Intent for first two attacks
is to hold their attention.

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:46.680
Final attack should have enough ordnance
to neutralize all enemy in the caves.

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.440
Type three BOC.

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:53.320
November, Victor,
1-1-4-8-7-6-3-5.

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.120
Say again, Playboy. Say again.

01:10:55.640 --> 01:11:01.056
November, Victor,
1-1-4-8-7-6-3-5. Over.

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:02.080
Copy.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.320
Eyes on you.

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:07.240
Three strikes. Eleven
hundred. Diversion.

01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:09.496
Eleven fifteen, diversion.

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:13.120
Eleven thirty, we're gonna light
that shit up and blow it to fuck.

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:14.160
Confirm, Playboy.

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:18.200
Oh, fuck.

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:20.480
Battery's dead.

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:21.640
We good?

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:24.760
Hope so.

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:28.040
Playboy, confirm?

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:30.080
Lost comms.

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:31.200
Fuck.

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:33.120
All right, we all know the plan.

01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:35.336
You both did some fine work
here today. Get out of here.

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:36.360
No, no, no, no, no.

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:38.560
We are not going anywhere.

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:40.280
I wasn't asking. You're done.

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:42.560
You're ten hours over
your eight-hour shift.

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:44.416
Okay, Reaper. Out of the chair.

01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:46.160
Eat a bag of dicks, Hawkins.

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:48.080
Hawkins?

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:49.880
It's Andrews.

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:52.320
Come on. Let me get you up.

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:54.680
No.

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.400
Exit the chair, Reaper.

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:58.920
There's no fucking
way I'm off this op.

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.360
No fucking way.

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:01.896
I got one KIA.

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:02.920
One MIA.

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:04.680
And I got two fucking nut jobs

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:07.160
trying to take on an
entire Abu Sayyaf camp.

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:09.280
That leaves one team, i.e. us,

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.856
to make sure this whole thing doesn't
go to hell in a fucking hand basket.

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:12.880
You finished?

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:14.880
I'm not finished.

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:16.240
I can keep going.

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:20.376
Then I suggest you think very carefully about the
next words that come out of your mouth, Captain.

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.440
Oh, come on, Virgil. You're
gonna pull rank on me?

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:24.080
You told me I could
have this chair

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:25.760
until the op was done.

01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:27.616
Go and watch the basketball.

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:30.720
Sir, with all due respect, this is
Reaper's op. We should be allowed to...

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:33.016
I don't recall asking your
opinion, Staff Sergeant.

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:35.160
Well, maybe that's
your problem, Colonel.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:40.080
I would strongly advise you to
not go down the same rabbit hole

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:41.400
as your partner here.

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:45.400
She did not say a word, Colonel.

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:48.400
Not a single word.

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:52.480
Exit the chair.

01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:54.440
Exit the room,

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.840
and I will do my best to forget
this conversation ever happened.

01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:13.680
Don't fuck it up, Junior.

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:15.160
You got it.

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:17.720
First strike 1100.
It's just a diversion.

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:19.296
Second strike 11...

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:20.320
Captain!

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:22.400
I'm good. I'm good.

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:24.040
You're dismissed.

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:28.200
Here we are.

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:36.880
Eyes.

01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:45.440
One guy in the tent.

01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:49.480
Two guys on the balcony.

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:54.320
What's our time?

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:56.360
Twenty.

01:13:58.280 --> 01:13:59.680
This is gonna get ugly.

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:02.880
I need you focused.
Head on a swivel.

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:05.760
If you see something I don't,

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:08.400
you say 'contact
left, contact right.'

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:10.496
Somebody comes from behind us,

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:12.240
you say 'six.'

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:14.680
I'll handle the rest.

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:20.120
Only shoot if it's necessary. We got to
keep this quiet for as long as we can.

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:22.920
For what it's worth,

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:24.880
you earned your tier
one status today.

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:28.000
Does that mean I get paid more?

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:29.920
Fuck no. It just sounds cooler.

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:32.840
You ready?

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:34.600
Nope.

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:35.760
You?

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:36.800
Always.

01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:42.080
Let's do it.

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:05.560
Okay.

01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:30.640
Fucker.

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:01.600
You good?

01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:02.880
Yeah.

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:04.920
Alright.

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:17.440
He's jammed.

01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:18.496
Go, go, go, go!

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:19.520
Come on!

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:28.480
Gun right. Right!

01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:36.400
Move! Move!

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:41.760
On me.

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:42.920
On you.

01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:57.040
Contact left!

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:00.480
Drop down!

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:08.520
You good?

01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:10.760
Fuck!

01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:46.240
Fuck.

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:02.040
Oh, fuck!

01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:06.000
Grenade!

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:07.240
Get down!

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:39.600
Hey, Sug.

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:40.920
Bishop.

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:44.240
This your idea of
a rescue mission?

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:49.480
I think I got them
right where I want 'em.

01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:57.440
You look like ass.

01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:58.600
Hey,

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:00.360
how you doing, Bishop?

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:02.160
Talk to me.

01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:06.480
Ah...

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:16.040
Air Force,

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:17.640
I think

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:19.440
we're in a bad spot.

01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:23.240
Yeah, we're in a bad spot.

01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:28.480
Hey!

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:31.320
Hey!

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.240
Hey, yo!

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:38.640
Hey, listen to me, man.

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:42.520
They're gonna drop bombs on
these caves. You understand?

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:44.096
Bombs on these caves.

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:46.760
If we don't get out of
here, we're all gonna die.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.280
You understand?
Bombs on these caves.

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:51.080
Fuck!

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:53.560
Stupid fucks!

01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:57.480
Stupid fucks!

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:02.920
Boeing 0-1, this is Sunburn 0-6.
We're tracking your position.

01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:05.720
Be advised ETA to
first drone strike,

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:07.360
two mikes.

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:10.080
All right, let's
fucking rock and roll.

01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:12.840
Zoom out 400 meters.

01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:20.120
I think they know

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:22.360
I'm not gonna last much longer.

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:28.896
Just... just... just hang
on a second, all right, man?

01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:30.616
I'm gonna figure out how
to get us out of here.

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:32.040
I'm already out.

01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:44.480
Just get Bishop and get
yourselves out of here.

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.160
Okay?

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:48.760
Nah, you're good, man.
You're good, you're good.

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:50.040
Don't

01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:52.696
fucking touch him!

01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:55.216
Or I'll fucking fucking fuck!

01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:56.240
Fuck!

01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:58.880
Fucking pieces of shit!

01:21:58.920 --> 01:21:59.680
Come on!

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:01.560
Get your fucking hands off him!

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:03.520
Fucking coward.

01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:07.920
Sugar?

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:10.200
Get your fucking hands off him!

01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:15.320
Hashimi,

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:17.120
you like that?

01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:20.480
Sugar?

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:28.600
Oh, fuck.

01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:30.240
Sugar?

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:31.320
I'm good.

01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:39.760
Fuck!

01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:43.840
Fuck!

01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:54.760
Welcome to Guantanamo.

01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:58.320
Go.

01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:21.880
You know Japan invaded
these lands in 1941.

01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:28.720
Hm. Built these caves
with the intent to stay

01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:33.200
but our Moro brothers defeated
them very quickly. Hm.

01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:38.920
You know this dam they built

01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:44.720
it was a very forward step.

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:53.760
Was it this blood

01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:56.200
washed from the land

01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:58.400
and into our mouths?

01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:19.920
But not to me.

01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:23.360
We answer to no
one but ourselves.

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:27.520
We were having a
fairly pleasant day.

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:30.520
Blessed by the...

01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:36.760
Then, how you say?

01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:40.600
Someone rains on our parade?

01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:43.880
Removed one imperialist

01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:47.600
just to find another.

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:52.200
This is not the conversation
we should be having right now.

01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:53.760
No?

01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:56.680
What should we talk about?

01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:58.440
I told you.

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.720
There's more bombs on the way.

01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:02.040
Ah,

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:06.560
I'm not interested in
your faceless bombs.

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:08.240
You see, real results

01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:10.920
are created face-to-face,

01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:13.600
interactions like

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:17.240
what you and I are
doing right here.

01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:14.640
Speak!

01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:16.296
Where are the other
commandos located?

01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:18.120
There's no more. It's just us!

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:30.240
Your jets are still in the area.

01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:32.760
Someone must be
communicating with them.

01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:35.400
We were communicating with them.

01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:36.280
Listen,

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:39.040
there's more strikes on the way.

01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:40.576
If we don't get out of here,
we're all fucking dust.

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:43.080
No! You are dust!

01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:45.120
Fucking dust!

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:06.920
How does this feel?

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:08.920
To be this scared.

01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:13.560
Too weak to do anything
about your own death.

01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:15.440
You may think that I do this

01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:17.720
without feeling anything.

01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:19.720
That is wrong.

01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:22.240
To kill affects me.

01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:25.840
To embrace the brutality
of this affects me.

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:29.000
And that is the difference
between you and I.

01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:31.880
I look a man in the eye,

01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:34.920
and I make my choice intimate.

01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:37.400
The bomb!

01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:52.440
Excuse me?

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Sir?

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:57.080
I got this thing here
I don't even know...

01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:59.360
I don't even know if this
is something that exists.

01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:02.440
My wife's written it down, so
she might have got it wrong.

01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:04.360
It sounds a little crazy,

01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:05.560
but, uh,

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:07.240
I gotta ask, you know?

01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:08.920
Do you have

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:14.240
artisanal tree nut
fermented plant-based cashew

01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:16.920
and tahini smoked
vegan new cheese.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:17.760
Is that a thing?

01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:18.800
Yeah,

01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:20.240
right here.

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:22.560
Man after my own heart.

01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:27.480
Huh. I would have bet money
against that. Thank you very much.

01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:29.400
All right, let's
fucking rock and roll.

01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:31.240
Zoom out 400 meters.

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:33.800
It's fucking showtime.

01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:55.400
Ready to fire.

01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:58.440
Bombs away.

01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:03.920
Six, five, four, three,

01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:06.880
two, one.

01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:08.360
Impact.

01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:48.160
Holy shit.

01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:51.320
You JSOC?

01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:56.440
Can you walk?

01:33:57.880 --> 01:33:59.040
Who are you?

01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:00.720
Who are you?

01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:35.640
Hey!

01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:45.120
Fuck!

01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:15.840
Fucking hell, Kinney.

01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:19.040
You good?

01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:20.120
Yeah, yeah.

01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:26.920
Who the fuck's that guy?

01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:28.520
The asset...

01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:29.760
I think.

01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:31.400
Come on. We gotta move.

01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:32.240
So soon?

01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:33.280
Let's go.

01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:39.160
Which way?

01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:41.160
I think it's this way.
Let's keep moving.

01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:52.240
Fuck.

01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:54.600
Yeah.

01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:56.520
Okay.

01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:58.320
All right.

01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:00.240
Sit here for a second.
I'll be right back.

01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:05.056
Boeing 0-1, this is Sunburn 0-6. You
are inbound to target. Five mikes.

01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:10.920
Copy incoming. We're hot. Let me know
when I can cross extend at 7-9-8-4-0.

01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:17.760
Fuck,

01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:19.720
fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:24.840
Come on.

01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:28.120
Fuck.

01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:31.480
Barbeque creepy peanuts.

01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:36.776
Yeah!

01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:37.680
Come on!

01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:39.400
Vegan sour cream.

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:43.280
Come on! Yeah!

01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:45.120
Plant based feta.

01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:47.120
Oh, you motherfucker!

01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:49.600
Fuck.

01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:05.040
Come on, man.

01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:06.840
Come on. Pick up
the fucking phone.

01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:09.640
Get the phone, Sergeant.

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:13.400
Sergeant!

01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:18.120
Yes, sir.

01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:19.336
Reaper. I need Reaper.

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:20.400
Reaper's gone.

01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:21.280
Try his cell...

01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:22.320
Wait, wait. Hold on.

01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:26.040
702-166-42… 00.

01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:29.920
Yeah! Come on!

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:31.560
Wait, wait, wait! Hold on!

01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:33.680
Hello?

01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:35.160
Fuck!

01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:45.000
6-4200.

01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:46.560
Come on, man.

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:48.600
Pick up the phone.

01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:51.320
I'm looking. I'm looking at
all of the shelves. All right.

01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:52.360
Hey,

01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:53.880
hold on.

01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:58.480
No, I'm looking at...

01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:00.320
It was a number I didn't know.

01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:02.400
I'm looking at all the shelves,

01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:05.040
but they got real
Mexican, you know?

01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:06.800
Cou... but with meat in it.

01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:10.040
No, I'm not...

01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:12.000
Baby, okay.

01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:13.296
All right? It's got meat in it.

01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:16.160
Sorry I shouldn't have
used the word real.

01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:21.200
Sunburn 0-6, this is Boeing
0-1. Approaching target.

01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:24.560
Come on. Move! Move!

01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:25.600
Okay?

01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:28.496
Tampon because

01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:30.576
I wanted to buy a degradable,

01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:33.800
No problem. Just go right ahead.

01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:34.880
Just

01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:36.800
what's your problem?

01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:37.840
Nothing.

01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:39.480
Okay.

01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:43.200
People is so aggressive...

01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:48.440
Reaper, it's Playboy.
Abort. I need you to abort.

01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:50.816
Abort the last strike. I need
you to abort the last...!

01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:51.840
Fuck!

01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:56.720
Call SitComm.

01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:58.720
I don't understand.

01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:01.176
Call SitComm, for fuck's sake.

01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:02.560
Calling SitComm.

01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:05.280
Yes!

01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:07.080
Come on!

01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:08.400
Yeah!

01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:10.800
Come on, motherfuckers.
Answer the phone.

01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:12.920
Lining up for the final run.

01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:21.080
Come on. Call SitComm.

01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:22.160
Come on! Come on!

01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:26.177
Motherfucker,

01:40:26.201 --> 01:40:27.616
answer the fucking phone.

01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:28.640
Come on!

01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:35.920
Come on!

01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:38.560
Oh, fuck it.

01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:39.760
Fuck it!

01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:49.520
Load 0-1 on final approach.

01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:52.160
Come on.

01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:02.160
Move! Move!

01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:04.120
Right there.

01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:05.560
Time to target

01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:06.600
30 seconds.

01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:16.496
Guys!

01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:17.320
Come on, move!

01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:18.177
What the...

01:41:18.201 --> 01:41:20.280
Impact 15 seconds.

01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:28.640
Abort the strike!

01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:31.080
We have payload. Ten seconds.

01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:41.440
Seven... six... five

01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:47.680
three, two, one...

01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:50.496
Boeing 0-1, abort!
Boeing 0-1, abort!

01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:51.520
Do you copy?

01:41:58.120 --> 01:41:59.120
What are you doing?

01:41:59.160 --> 01:41:59.760
They copy?

01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:00.120
Yeah.

01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:01.640
The operator

01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:03.120
is still in the target area.

01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:04.160
Bullshit.

01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:05.080
Zoom in.

01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:05.560
Zoom in

01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:06.680
to the caves

01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:08.360
where the strike was gonna be.

01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:11.720
There he is. That's
him. That's Playboy.

01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:14.040
Sorry, man.

01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:16.240
Goddamn, Reaper.

01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:35.040
Who

01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:37.240
are you waving at?

01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:39.320
A friend.

01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:00.800
Fuck!

01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:21.840
Who won the game?

01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:24.760
Vols, baby.

01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:26.400
Elite eight.

01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:27.880
That's wonderful, Colonel,

01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:29.200
congratulations.

01:43:29.640 --> 01:43:31.440
It's an excellent win for you

01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:33.200
and the great
state of Tennessee.

01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:34.640
That's right.

01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:39.360
I just called that phone

01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:42.240
five fucking times.

01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:45.440
Ringer's off again.

01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:47.800
Now it wasn't my pregnant wife.

01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:54.040
But it was a life-or-death situation
for a JTAC operator in the field.

01:43:56.360 --> 01:43:58.520
Our job is communication!

01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:01.336
Our priority is protecting
the men and women

01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:03.360
who serve this country.

01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:07.160
So if you don't mind,

01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:10.120
can we get back on
with the fucking job?

01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:18.040
Hell you think you're doing?

01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:21.240
You can take that out of my
active-duty bonuses, Colonel.

01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:10.520
Hey, get some sleep.

01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:11.800
See you in the morning.

01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:12.880
See you then.

01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:15.840
Uh

01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:18.120
You don't own a tux, do you?

01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:19.360
A tux?

01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:21.520
I do not own a tux, no.

01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:22.560
Okay.

01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:25.400
Wedding is not black tie, right?

01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:27.800
No, not black tie.

01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:29.480
The wedding party is.

01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:33.000
Are you gonna ask me
to be a bridesmaid?

01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:34.440
No, Reaper.

01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:40.200
I was gonna ask if you want
to walk me down the aisle.

01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:44.760
You serious?

01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:46.520
Yeah.

01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:48.520
Wow.

01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:53.416
That would be one of
the greatest privileges

01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:54.480
of my life.

01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:01.800
You know one thing I know

01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:03.560
one hundred percent for sure.

01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:05.880
Your dad

01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:07.800
would be so proud of you.

01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:11.440
Thank you.

01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:13.680
So, what are we
going to dance to?

01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:14.576
Dance?

01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:15.120
Yeah.

01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:17.840
Oh, no, I have not
thought about that yet.

01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:19.720
Okay. Well, you
got to pick a song

01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:22.400
and then just
listen to my hands.

01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:24.600
I'm gonna listen to your hands?

01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:25.536
Oh, yeah. Yes, you are.

01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:26.160
Oh, okay.

01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:27.720
Whoa, okay.

01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:30.080
Run this round my back.

01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:30.400
This?

01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:32.416
- That way, I know where it's coming.
- That's right. There you go.

01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:32.880
Okay, what's next?

01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:34.520
Come back in and out.

01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:35.520
Out.

01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:36.360
And back to me.

01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:36.896
Okay.

01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:37.400
Yeah.

01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:38.056
And then out.

01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:38.680
Out.

01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:39.856
This time around.

01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:41.176
Give me the other hand.

01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:42.200
Oh okay.

01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:43.696
Walking over. Oh, around.

01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:44.776
Around my back.

01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:46.880
Beautiful.

01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:48.576
You have done this
many, many times before.

01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:50.160
I've had a few Dosey Does.

01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:52.000
Oh, you're pretty good.
You're pretty good.

01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:54.456
Any other dances. You
know how to twerk?

01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:55.640
To who? To twerk?

01:46:55.680 --> 01:46:56.680
To twerk.

01:46:57.040 --> 01:47:01.400
- Uh, no. I don't know how to twerk.
- You better get practicing. Yeah.
