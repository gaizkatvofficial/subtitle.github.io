00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:23,150
Imperial diary, year 10191, third comment.

2
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,430
The battle for Arrakis
took everyone by surprise.

3
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,170
There were no witnesses.

4
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,070
The Harkon and Operation was
perpetrated overnight, without warning.

5
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,550
Or a declaration of war.

6
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,380
The warning, the Atreides were no more.

7
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,220
I'll guide in the dark.

8
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,840
And the Emperor said...

9
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,800
Since that night my father
has not been the same.

10
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,380
Nor have I.

11
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,220
His inaction is difficult for me to accept.

12
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,520
By the calculus of power.

13
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,480
This would not be the first time the
Harkonans have done his dirty work.

14
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,270
The end of House Atreides.

15
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,250
Shouldn't you go back to the stars?

16
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,470
Be with him?

17
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,890
I'm afraid I won't have enough time
to fix things before you're coming.

18
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,510
This world is beyond cruelty.

19
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,250
Stay here.

20
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:40,850
Don't be a cop! No, no, no, no.

21
00:05:40,851 --> 00:05:49,810


22
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,990
The Harkon and Operation are over.

23
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:54,581
How are you? I'm sorry.

24
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,780
I'm sorry.

25
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,280


26
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:16,090
Are you okay? I'm fine.

27
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,530
I'm fine.

28
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,830
I'm fine.

29
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,570


30
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,981
Never stand with your
back towards the open.

31
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,130
How many times do I have to
tell you that, huh? You okay? Yeah.

32
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:23,770



33
00:08:24,115 --> 00:08:26,250
How about her? She's fine.

34
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,430


35
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:39,150
I do not usually venture this deep.

36
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,690
I want to make sure no Atreides escaped.

37
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,830
You think too much of yourself.

38
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,950
No, no, we are in the deep desert.

39
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,730
Only freemen can survive here.

40
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,150
They were here for us, not for you.

41
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,490
Don't worry.

42
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,650
I'm taking you somewhere
they will never find us.

43
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,340
Filthy water.

44
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,580
It's full of chemicals, but good
enough for cooling system.

45
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,900
Turn it out.

46
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,240
You okay?

47
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,560
Don't let that out.

48
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,220
Don't let it out! I can't.

49
00:09:33,221 --> 00:09:34,221
No, I can't.

50
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,060
I'm okay.

51
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,420


52
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,700
Are you sure?

53
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,670
You fought well.

54
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:47,885
Once you woke up.

55
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,380
I wasn't sleeping.

56
00:09:50,404 --> 00:10:00,404
<b><font color="#60ff00">Subtitle made by Master_Blaster for https://subscene.com/</font></b>

57
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,610
I'm sorry.

58
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,150
I'm sorry.

59
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,880
I'm sorry.

60
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:51,940
No, no, no.

61
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,400
I'll die.

62
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,724
Now that the spies found
some insecurity, I strongly

63
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:03,330
recommend bringing all troops
out of frame and territories.

64
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,830
We're losing too many men to the desert.

65
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,950
Rats.

66
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,510
I beg your pardon?

67
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:09,850
We're losing them.

68
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,530
They're rats.

69
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:18,410
For freemen, I can't confirm our
communications are hectic in the open sands.

70
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,650
Your orders.

71
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,330
We need to control the whole planet.

72
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,770
We are.

73
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:25,330
That's the only half of it.

74
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:30,050
As you may recall, the South
is an uninhabitable minority.

75
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,370
May I suggest you get some rest?

76
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,170
Rats!

77
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,170
Kill them all!

78
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,090
Kill them all!

79
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,990
Rats!

80
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:30,290
He's asking why we're so late.

81
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:33,290
We're going to have to get out of here.

82
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,710
We're going to have to get out of here.

83
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,910
He thinks your spies are so late.

84
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,670
They're not going to be here.

85
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,230
He's over there.

86
00:13:40,231 --> 00:13:41,231
I got that.

87
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:42,530
Thanks.

88
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,470
Stay close to me.

89
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,140
You're welcome.

90
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,700
They'll come.

91
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,900
They'll come.

92
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,460
I will come now.

93
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:02,135
U.S.S.

94
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,850
S has been Some of them
already think I'm their messiah.

95
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,691
Others... False prophet.

96
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,430
I must sway the non-believers.

97
00:16:56,005 --> 00:16:58,045
If they follow me, we can
disrupt spice production.

98
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,650
That's the only way I
can get to the Emperor.

99
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,890
Your father didn't believe in revenge.

100
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:05,990
Hell, I do.

101
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,670
What's happening?

102
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,850
The way he's on his electsets.

103
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,210
What is it?

104
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,130
There's slicing up food.

105
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,090
It's a year for Howard Gino to a fever.

106
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,830
It's a rifle.

107
00:17:57,435 --> 00:17:59,115
I'm not sure what the bottom is, does she?

108
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:02,310
I'm not sure what the bottom is, does she?

109
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:06,840
Woman, come with me.

110
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,840
Dying thirst would ever drink this water.

111
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,120
This is sinking.

112
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:40,580
We have thousands of places
where we have enough water.

113
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,500
The lizanal cave will
change the face of Arrakis.

114
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,920
It will bring back the trees, it
will bring back a green paradise.

115
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:03,140
Yes, that's, that's, that's.

116
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,950
I'm going to get you a water
away, not even for the dead.

117
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,570
Why are you showing me this?

118
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:18,690
Because you were benedigess of it,
because you understand the prophecies.

119
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,630
The mother of the lizanal
cave will be our very mother.

120
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,450
However, mother is dying.

121
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,890
You want me to take
her place? Yes, I do.

122
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,630


123
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:38,070
Do you believe in Paul?

124
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,060
There are signs.

125
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,730
Yes.

126
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,200
What if I would refuse?

127
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:53,310
There is not lizanal cave, and
you have no purpose to serve.

128
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,450
What else is left to do then
but return your water to the well?

129
00:20:57,451 --> 00:20:58,451
Oh.

130
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,940
It's an honor, isn't it?

131
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,970
I think you should feel honored.

132
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,040
Well, it was a choice between this or
death, so forgive me if I'm not flattered.

133
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,660
How does one become a reverend mother?

134
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,260
It's different from one culture to another.
Here on Arrakis, I have no idea.

135
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,680
You're afraid.

136
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,045
The reverend mother is a
task withholding the memories

137
00:21:27,057 --> 00:21:28,740
of all the reverend mothers
that came before them,

138
00:21:28,741 --> 00:21:31,500
so I'll be given centuries
of pain and sorrow.

139
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,580
Is it dangerous?

140
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,420
It's lethal for men, that's for sure.

141
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,720
What are you guys
laughing about? Don't bother.

142
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,490


143
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,760
You don't believe in
all this? No, we don't.

144
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,460
These are all southern beliefs.

145
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,440
Southern beliefs?

146
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,760
Southern tribes believe that messiah
will come to deliver us from evil.

147
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,460
You don't believe in them, lizanal cave?

148
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:08,580
We believe in Fremen, Bilal Kaifa.

149
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,140
You want to control people?
You tell them a messiah will come.

150
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,060
Then they'll wait for centuries.

151
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,540
No, we must pray.

152
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,050
What about him?

153
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,430
Stovar? He's from the south.

154
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,670
He didn't notice his accent.

155
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,300
What will happen to my mother?

156
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:48,060
She's from the south.

157
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,180
He's from the south.

158
00:23:50,181 --> 00:23:53,720
He's from the south, but you can't
tell him that he's from the south.

159
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:58,880
It's a It's a It's
a It's a It's a

00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:27,970

It's a What is it? 5, 6.

163
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:48,160
..

164
00:26:48,501 --> 00:26:50,420
6...

165
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,680
She's right!

166
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,420
She's right!

167
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,180
It's no miracle.

168
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,760
My mother was trained to do that.

169
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,430
Poisoned transmutation is something
advanced men in Jezeroine can do.

170
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,030
I'm not the Mahdi.

171
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:13,710
I'm not here to lead.

172
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:17,450
N'zia hajika.

173
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,550
Gef dak.

174
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,070
Let me fight beside you.

175
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,170
I'll wait.

176
00:27:28,665 --> 00:27:29,510
I'm not the Mahdi.

177
00:27:29,511 --> 00:27:29,570
Gef dak.

178
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,190
I'm the Mahdi.

179
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:35,050
I'm the Mahdi.

180
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:36,930
I'm in the Mahdi.

181
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:42,490
I'm not the Mahdi.

182
00:27:42,491 --> 00:27:42,830
I'm not the Mahdi.

183
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,230
I'm not the Mahdi.

184
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,620
How is she?

185
00:27:52,825 --> 00:27:54,360
She was frightened, but she's...

186
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,320
She's okay.

187
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,540
Paul, she talks to me.

188
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,310
She believes in you.

189
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:17,770
She says,

190
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,910
they go inside that rock,

191
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,870
and she will hold you.

192
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:26,770
You're so close now.

193
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,870
Only one step remains,

194
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,170
and you will become the Goi-Satat Rock.

195
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,110
Only one step remains.

196
00:28:34,111 --> 00:28:36,270
You must do what I did.

197
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,650
You must drink the water of life.

198
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:43,470
For your mind, it's gonna... It's
gonna open, and you will see.

199
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,630
Oh, yes, you do.

200
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,190
You sweet jerk!

201
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,960
If you wanna fight with us,

202
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,900
first thing you must learn

203
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,800
to be one with the desert.

204
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,740
So, here is a tent

205
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,440
and enough food.

206
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,100
I want you to cross

207
00:29:07,785 --> 00:29:10,400
that small egg and come back.

208
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,460
Travel by night.

209
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,480
You know how to use a paracombas.

210
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,640
Yes.

211
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,710
Anything else I should know?

212
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,460
Beside the worms and the harconins,

213
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,580
beware of the trapdoor spiders.

214
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,120
Centipedes are very nasty.

215
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,340
Not the big ones.

216
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,900
They are harmless.

217
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,480
But the little ones,

218
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,040
you have to worry about.

219
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,460
Don't ever,

220
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,660
ever listen to that jian.

221
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,920
The jian?

222
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,840
Jian, desert spirits.

223
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,880
They whisper at night,

224
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,800
on and at somewhere.

225
00:29:55,595 --> 00:29:56,700
The king says you.

226
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,880
Really, be careful.

227
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,860
They are demons.

228
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,080
Gah! But it's true.

229
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,180


230
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,340
Don't listen to them.

231
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,240
If you don't listen to them,

232
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,660
you have to listen to them.

233
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,820
What do you want to give them?

234
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,160
I don't want to.

235
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,590
I don't want to give them anything.

236
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,280
I don't want to.

237
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,380
I don't want to.

238
00:30:35,381 --> 00:30:36,381
I don't want to.

239
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,320
I want to give them anything.

240
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,420
I want to give them anything.

241
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,200
I want to give them anything.

242
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,900
Jamis.

243
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,580
Sandwalk like a drunk lizard.

244
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,620
I'm doing pretty good so far.

245
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,940
You're not even in worm territory yet.

246
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,520
You have to break up your rhythm.

247
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,760
Like this.

248
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,760
Now that's interesting because
in the film books I've studied,

249
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,300
the anthropologists say in
order to properly sandwalk,

250
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,700
you actually have to...

251
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,780
Never mind.

252
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,420
Please keep going.

253
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:54,070
You know, I'm the only one who believes
you're going to make it until summer.

254
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,390
Everyone else thinks you
won't make it two weeks.

255
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:00,870
If you want to follow us in the desert,
you need to know how wind traps work.

256
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:01,990
So listen to me.

257
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:02,790
They're simple.

258
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,410
They require constant attention.

259
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,290
This right here in cash is the question.

260
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,270
Here's the answer.

261
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:15,150
These are the answers that needs
to be changed every three weeks.

262
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:17,770
One.

263
00:33:17,771 --> 00:33:18,771
One.

264
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,370
Stop looking at me like that.

265
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,610
If we want to protect your brother,

266
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:43,010
we need all the Fremen
to believe in the prophecy.

267
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,580
We must convert the non-believers.

268
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,650
We need to start with the weaker ones.

269
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,210
For fun.

270
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,840
Fuck! I got you.

271
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,920


272
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,460
You're the only one! I got you.

273
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:58,980
..

274
00:35:58,981 --> 00:36:07,661
No... ... ... ... ... ... ...

275
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,060
... ... ...

276
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:20,560
...

277
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,460
... ... ...

278
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:43,321
... ...

279
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:56,240
... ... ...

280
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:06,140
...

281
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:14,080
... ... ...

282
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,641
... ...

283
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,230
...

284
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:29,091
... ... ... ...

285
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:31,090
... ... ... ... ...

286
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,310
...

287
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:58,410
... ... ...

288
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,770
...

289
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:43,400
... ... ...

290
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,360
...

291
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,560
The ways of thinking.

292
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,291
You know everything about the desert.

293
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,800
You harness the very power of it.

294
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,060
We can stop them together.

295
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,540
Bury them in the sand where they belong.

296
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,840
So that this planet can be yours once more.

297
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,040
What will you have us do?

298
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,060
What would you do? Still there?

299
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,620
I would strike even further north.

300
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,000
Then I will go further north.

301
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,680
The further north you go
the more likely it is you die.

302
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:49,100
The future will not be over either.

303
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,480
You know everything about the desert.

304
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,800
Still there.

305
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,941
Also there's the very power of it.

306
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:05,980
Please give your attention.

307
00:41:05,981 --> 00:41:07,021
Have a little bit of time.

308
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,960
Give it!

309
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,158
You shall be known
among us as Usul, and now

310
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:42,870
a Fedeikin is a fighter
and needs a warning.

311
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:50,860
You shall be known among
us as Usul, and now a

312
00:41:50,872 --> 00:41:57,670
Fedeikin, and now a
Fedeikin, and now a Fedeikin,

313
00:41:57,671 --> 00:41:57,754
now a Fedeikin, and
now a Fedeikin, and now a

314
00:41:57,766 --> 00:41:57,870
Fedeikin, and now a
Fedeikin, and now a Fedeikin,

315
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:15,639
now a Fedeikin, and now a
Fedeikin, and now a Fedeikin,

316
00:42:16,411 --> 00:42:18,410
and now a Fedeikin, and
That is a powerful name.

317
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:25,220
Now you are our brother...

318
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:30,000
...or Muad'Dib Ussul.

319
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,780
Oi! Your hands.

320
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,060


321
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,780
Oi, I think Ussul.

322
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,220
Go ahead.

323
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,080
Ussul.

324
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,600
It's breathtaking.

325
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,080
Look.

326
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,600
Hide there, Spice.

327
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,960
The rakis is so beautiful
when the sun is low.

328
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,400
Where are you from?

329
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:17,760
Does water really fall
from the sky? Oh, yes.

330
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,440


331
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,640
Sometimes it rains for weeks.

332
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I'm coming down.

333
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,720
Where do you see sand
here? Imagine water.

334
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,140


335
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,560
Our castle stands on cliffs,

336
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,060
high above the sea.

337
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,940
If you dive in, you can't reach the bottom.

338
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,160
You dive in?

339
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:37,340
Yes.

340
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,240
It's cold swimming.

341
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,660
I don't believe Ussul.

342
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,920
Ussul.

343
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,560
What's your secret name? Sihaya.

344
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,460
Sihaya.

345
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:52,780


346
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:55,440
What does that mean?

347
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,460
It means desert spring.

348
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:59,420
Desert spring.

349
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,640
I love it.

350
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:03,180
I hate it.

351
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,200
It's from some stupid prophecy.

352
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:07,980
I prefer Johnny.

353
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,040
I prefer Johnny too, then.

354
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:18,730
Do you think Silver
will teach me? To write.

355
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:20,350


356
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:23,430
No.

357
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,470
Only from in write parts.

358
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:27,530
By name, not by blood.

359
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:34,310
Your blood melts from
dukes and great houses.

360
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:37,690
We don't have that here.

361
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:39,990
Here.

362
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:41,850
Or equal.

363
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:42,950
Men and women.

364
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,660
Home.

365
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,920
More deep, Ussul.

366
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,780
Maybe you could be from him.

367
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,840
Maybe I'll show you the way.

368
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,490
I want to know how you feel.

369
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:17,240
I wish I was gonna say no.

370
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:50,231
For emen attacks, on your
watch, your orders were

371
00:47:50,243 --> 00:47:54,920
to restore spies'
production to full capacity.

372
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,020
Do you know what it means if you fail?

373
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,420
The emperor will take
spies out of our control.

374
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,380
Tighten your grip, Revan.

375
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,260
I'll call.

376
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:10,600
Or feel mine on your neck.

377
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:29,140
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay.

378
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,060
I'm here. I'm here.

379
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:44,231
It's been a while since you've
had one of those nightmares.

380
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,150
Tell me, what was it about?

381
00:48:57,230 --> 00:49:00,190
Nothing's clear. It's only fragments.

382
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:06,250
I'm in the south, and
I'm following someone.

383
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:09,570
And it triggers a holy war.

384
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:19,310
Millions and millions of people
starving to death because of me.

385
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:30,070
You've been exposed to spies for a
long time. They can create weird dreams.

386
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:42,090
It's a big day.
But can I still work on it all?

387
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:01,270
No. I'm fine. I'm sorry.

388
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:08,380
I do met myself. Here.

389
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:10,020
Thanks.

390
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:15,980
Don't try to impress anyone.
You're brave. We all know that.

391
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:22,360
Be simple. Be direct. Nothing fancy.

392
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:23,400
Nothing fancy?

393
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:27,140
Hey, I'm serious. Nothing fancy.
You will shame my teaching.

394
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,200
I will shame you. I understand.

395
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:35,480
Shai Hulu decides today if you
become Fremen. Or if you die.

396
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:46,000
Hey, what's up? What's going on?

397
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,640
What's going on?

398
00:50:52,915 --> 00:50:53,915
What's going on?

399
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,380
What's going on?

400
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,200
What's going on? It's me.

401
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,680


402
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:09,180
Ah! Hey, what's
going on? I'm sorry.

403
00:57:09,181 --> 00:57:11,000
I'm trying to get out.

404
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,100
Let me tell you something.

405
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:19,460
I will not kill you.

406
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:21,200
Give it up!

407
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:58,802
They believe in Paul.
Now we go south.

408
00:57:58,814 --> 00:58:03,160
There are millions of
fundamentalists there.

409
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:08,795
They will protect
him when he comes.

410
00:58:08,807 --> 00:58:13,190
The quiz that's happening
will be born in the south.

411
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:39,335
As long as I breathe, I'm sorry.

412
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:42,410
There will be trouble.

413
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:46,031
What are you talking about?

414
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:51,070
Finally, what do you mean?

415
00:58:51,071 --> 00:58:55,250
The way they look at you.
They were from you now.

416
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:02,430
The night you make out your
victories is so you can see the future.

417
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:04,550
I suppose he's not okay.

418
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:07,430
I don't know, Messiah.

419
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:12,550
I'm a Phidican, I've see-stopped.

420
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:16,127
Yet we have a penny just
right among us, fanning

421
00:59:16,139 --> 00:59:18,670
the flames of your legend,
saying you're the one.

422
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:47,810
She says you should be coming with us.

423
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:49,790
No, I can't.

424
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:51,530
She's asking why?

425
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:53,857
Because I must
continue fighting in the

426
00:59:53,869 --> 00:59:55,690
north to protect you
down there in the south.

427
00:59:57,940 --> 00:59:59,850
She says she can tell when you lie.

428
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:04,530
Tell her that's because our mother
keeps spreading dangerous tales.

429
01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:13,030
What is she saying?

430
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,755
She says you're blinded by
love, and she reminds you that

431
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:19,920
you must reserve your hand
for the most strategic alliance.

432
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,800
She's also wondering why
you don't believe in who you are.

433
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:29,060
I do believe.
I believe I matter to these people.

434
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,940
I believe I'm making
a difference in this war.

435
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,340
We're nearly at the gates of the city.

436
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:37,980
That's not what she means.

437
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:39,360
I know what she means.

438
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:41,780
Do you not think I also feel
the weight of the prophecy?

439
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:46,880
It's a story that you keep telling,
but it's not their story, it's yours.

440
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,560
They deserve to be led by one of their own.

441
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:52,980
What your people did to
this world is heartbreaking.

442
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,020
We gave them something to hope for.

443
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:56,100
That's not hope!

444
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:53,710
We should not leave the security perimeter!

445
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:59,040
Security perimeter! The rest hope so!

446
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,600
Or should I give them my word?

447
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,180
Today, we'll keep doing it!

448
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,960
We'll keep doing it!

449
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:10,510
One day!

450
01:06:11,790 --> 01:06:12,790
Show yourself!

451
01:06:26,430 --> 01:06:27,430
No!

452
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,950
It's unlocked! It's unlocked!

453
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:59,470
So no, Fremen prophet.

454
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:04,201
It's not the first time we've
had frictions with the Fremen.

455
01:08:04,770 --> 01:08:05,930
None of this magnitude.

456
01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:11,700
So, my dear daughter,

457
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:14,960
how would you deal with this prophet?

458
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:24,040
If this Muad'Dib is a religious figure,

459
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:27,340
you can't use direct force.

460
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:31,300
Repression only makes a religion flourish.

461
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,180
You'll only end up humiliating yourself.

462
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:36,380
You underestimate my side of God.

463
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,460
You underestimate the power of faith.

464
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:46,060
The Highness proves once again
that she was my most acute student.

465
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:49,760
It's an assassin's.

466
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:51,200
No.

467
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:52,940
Prophets get stronger when they die.

468
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:56,820
Let the conflict on Arrakis turn into war.

469
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:58,380
You then bring peace.

470
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:00,480
As a savior.

471
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:04,221
You'll be a formidable empress.

472
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:09,960
Muad'Dib,

473
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:13,260
the prophet, the one who points the way.

474
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:16,481
These are our own
religious patterns, aren't they?

475
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:17,960
This is our doing.

476
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:23,790
Muad'Dib means kangaroo mouse.

477
01:09:24,690 --> 01:09:26,090
An unusual warning for a Fremen.

478
01:09:28,625 --> 01:09:30,306
What if all the treaties were still alive?

479
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:31,590
Enough!

480
01:09:31,790 --> 01:09:32,950
This must not come out.

481
01:09:33,730 --> 01:09:35,550
Even to your father's
ears, understand? I do, Rep.

482
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:37,630
Mother.

483
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:41,890
If Paul is alive, he
likely knows the truth.

484
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:45,100
And should the great
houses learn that your

485
01:09:45,112 --> 01:09:47,650
father was behind the
liquidation of the Atreides,

486
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:51,030
your father will face
war and lose the throne.

487
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:54,410
Then what hope is there? Hope.

488
01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:57,130


489
01:09:58,330 --> 01:09:59,570
We are Bene Gesserit.

490
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:01,390
We don't hope.

491
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:02,750
We plan.

492
01:10:03,650 --> 01:10:05,470
Paul is not our only prospect.

493
01:10:07,565 --> 01:10:12,330
The Baron's youngest nephew,
Fade-Rotha Harkonnen, will inherit Arrakis.

494
01:10:14,130 --> 01:10:15,130
He may be the answer.

495
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:16,630
Fade-Rotha? He's psychotic.

496
01:10:16,930 --> 01:10:17,970


497
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:19,350
That's irrelevant.

498
01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:23,090
The question is, can we control him?

499
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:25,390
And I intend to find out.

500
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:50,550
Would you like some fresh
meats, my darling? Thanks.

501
01:10:50,551 --> 01:10:51,551
Lungs.

502
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:53,810
A liver.

503
01:10:53,890 --> 01:10:54,890


504
01:10:55,170 --> 01:10:56,170
What would you like?

505
01:10:56,690 --> 01:10:57,870
I hear they're big today.

506
01:10:58,330 --> 01:10:59,330
Your new blades.

507
01:10:59,925 --> 01:11:01,990
For this very special day.

508
01:11:02,770 --> 01:11:04,550
Napa and Fade-Rotha.

509
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:33,950
And not your bones.

510
01:11:34,650 --> 01:11:35,650
It's the dip.

511
01:11:36,850 --> 01:11:37,850
Should be sharpened.

512
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:53,090
Come!

513
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:55,190
I won't die like a fool.

514
01:11:55,970 --> 01:11:56,970
Kill me now.

515
01:11:57,130 --> 01:11:59,310
No drug for you today, Atreides.

516
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:05,310
Take this long, oldie.

517
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:06,750
What do you want?

518
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:25,300
This fight's all for sure.

519
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:28,620
But we'll get a good look at him.

520
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,590
We can cancel the fight.

521
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:16,190
I'll explore my nephew's birthday.

522
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:24,230
Who's there?

523
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:19,580
Who's there?

524
01:16:19,581 --> 01:16:20,581
I said it!

525
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:22,280
Who's there?

526
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,040
Why'd we not stop the fight?

527
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:25,660
Transloping plans?

528
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,180
Show me who you are.

529
01:16:32,181 --> 01:16:34,200
...

530
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:53,580
...

531
01:17:55,620 --> 01:18:01,060
...

532
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:16,001
... ...

533
01:19:04,571 --> 01:19:10,330
Don't be hasty.
I have another gift for you. A bigger one.

534
01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:13,010
A ruckus.

535
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
What about Robert?

536
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:20,660
He has failed to protect Spice production.

537
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,420
Robert would be reassigned.

538
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:28,780
Claim a ruckus fight.

539
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:32,420
Free the Spice. I'll make you Emperor.

540
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:50,800
How?

541
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:55,880
The Emperor helped
me destroy their traitors.

542
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:01,100
And led his own army to the course.
A serious crime.

543
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:06,720
If it came to light, the great
houses would rise against him.

544
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,840
And then... Who will sit on
the throne? Fade Rawthog.

545
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,560
Park it in.

546
01:20:14,561 --> 01:20:16,860


547
01:20:56,510 --> 01:20:57,710
You're following me.

548
01:20:59,090 --> 01:21:00,090
Am I?

549
01:21:01,630 --> 01:21:03,190
I may have gotten lost.

550
01:21:05,410 --> 01:21:07,710
Will you show me the way out at this maze?

551
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:09,670
My Lord Nabarin.

552
01:21:17,230 --> 01:21:19,150
We've met, our dream.

553
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:23,650
I don't think so.

554
01:21:24,950 --> 01:21:26,170
I'm Lady Margot Fenry.

555
01:21:27,190 --> 01:21:29,310
I'm here to honor your coming of age.

556
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:31,250
You're not allowed in this section.

557
01:21:32,290 --> 01:21:33,890
How did you get past
the guards? The guards.

558
01:21:34,570 --> 01:21:35,570


559
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:40,470
May I ask what are you doing here?

560
01:21:42,370 --> 01:21:44,970
You're not taking part
in your own celebrations.

561
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:57,620
You're better desert.

562
01:21:58,920 --> 01:21:59,920
And why?

563
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:06,360
I dreamed about you last night.

564
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:08,720
A pleasant dream I hope.

565
01:22:08,721 --> 01:22:10,120
Don't mock me on that.

566
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:11,220
Why would you dare?

567
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,600
Right now you've been a jesser in tricks.

568
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,720
And what do you know about
the name of jesserit? Tell me.

569
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:24,060


570
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:28,780
Is something wrong?

571
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:30,600
I don't recognize this place.

572
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:33,220
This is the guest way.

573
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:37,250
Where are you going? To my room.

574
01:22:37,251 --> 01:22:40,750


575
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:33,660
Put your right hand in the box.

576
01:23:49,030 --> 01:23:56,310
A sociopath of high intelligence, driven,
cruel, but strongly motivated by honor.

577
01:23:57,690 --> 01:23:58,690
He yearns to be hurt.

578
01:23:59,670 --> 01:24:00,670
He loves pain.

579
01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:02,850
Can he be redeemed?

580
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:04,210
He can be controlled.

581
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:06,290
He's sexually vulnerable.

582
01:24:08,590 --> 01:24:09,590
And?

583
01:24:11,205 --> 01:24:12,210
The bloodline is secured.

584
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:16,590
A female, as you requested.

585
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,220
You did well, Margot.

586
01:24:20,650 --> 01:24:23,270
Respectfully, why didn't
you test him yourself?

587
01:24:25,205 --> 01:24:26,470
Well, I'm a mother, Eichika.

588
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:30,350
And based on what
happened between him and his

589
01:24:30,362 --> 01:24:32,890
own mother, I didn't
expect to be effective.

590
01:24:32,891 --> 01:24:35,290
What happened between him
and his mother? He mad at her.

591
01:24:36,370 --> 01:24:37,370


592
01:24:38,710 --> 01:24:40,790
Desire and humiliation.

593
01:24:42,730 --> 01:24:43,830
Those are his levers.

594
01:24:45,270 --> 01:24:50,430
If Fade Rother prevails on Arrakis,
we shall know how to control him.

595
01:25:03,270 --> 01:25:04,990
Fade Rother.

596
01:25:06,010 --> 01:25:10,670
Fade Rother.

597
01:25:10,671 --> 01:25:13,010
Bring me a misremend, gamer.

598
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:59,140
Fade Rother.

599
01:25:59,691 --> 01:26:01,510
These idiots, I blame.

600
01:26:03,310 --> 01:26:06,590
A still suit is full of piss.

601
01:26:10,730 --> 01:26:12,190
It's caked in sand.

602
01:26:14,330 --> 01:26:18,550
Save me for these better
morons than I ever were.

603
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:26,040
Juicy.

604
01:26:26,660 --> 01:26:27,660
Juicy, Juicy.

605
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:32,600
Oh, that was nice knowing you.

606
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:33,920
Oh, yeah?

607
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:36,800
All right, that was clear, man. Come here.

608
01:26:58,760 --> 01:26:59,760
Jessie, Jessie.

609
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:01,360
Yeah, I got a meter reading a point.

610
01:27:01,361 --> 01:27:03,040
Hey, guys, words are on their way.

611
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:04,520
I got a meter reading a point.

612
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:52,780
Fade!

613
01:27:57,710 --> 01:27:57,730
Fade!

614
01:27:57,750 --> 01:27:58,830
Come on, Fade!

615
01:28:17,850 --> 01:28:19,990
Come on, Fade!

616
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:27,160
You're your pup.

617
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:29,240
You're your pup!

618
01:29:36,370 --> 01:29:39,333
Well, after the Battle
of Arrakeen, I was able

619
01:29:39,345 --> 01:29:42,450
to negotiate a trip back
home for the survivors.

620
01:29:43,890 --> 01:29:44,950
Thanks to these guys.

621
01:29:46,410 --> 01:29:47,410
Why'd you stay? I wanted blood.

622
01:29:48,570 --> 01:29:49,570
Rabon's head.

623
01:29:52,210 --> 01:29:53,210


624
01:29:56,570 --> 01:30:00,037
Since Muad'Dib has been
driving Rabon crazy, the

625
01:30:00,049 --> 01:30:03,310
smuggling business
has been quite profitable.

626
01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:05,630
Guardian, I like the smuggler.

627
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,320
Paul Muad'Dib.

628
01:30:10,690 --> 01:30:12,540
I've heard many stories about Muad'Dib.

629
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:15,240
None of them pretty.

630
01:30:17,190 --> 01:30:18,190
You'll see the fear.

631
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:21,540
That our resources are limited.

632
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:26,380
Fear is all we have.

633
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:44,750
How many men with
you? Two hundred.

634
01:30:45,310 --> 01:30:45,690


635
01:30:46,150 --> 01:30:47,150
Two hundred!

636
01:30:48,390 --> 01:30:49,390
Shh!

637
01:30:52,075 --> 01:30:54,716
Do you realize what you were able
to achieve with two hundred men?

638
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:57,300
Incredible fighters.

639
01:30:57,900 --> 01:30:59,296
Duncan said there were millions of them.

640
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:00,320
In the Deep South.

641
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:00,780
Yes.

642
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:02,320
Well, what are you waiting for?

643
01:31:03,340 --> 01:31:06,260
With thousands of these guys, you
can take control of the entire planet.

644
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:08,640
It's your father's dream.
What are you afraid of? Fate.

645
01:31:08,641 --> 01:31:09,641


646
01:31:11,770 --> 01:31:13,160
Worship, Gurney.

647
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:15,700
I used to be friends.

648
01:31:17,420 --> 01:31:18,420
Now they're followers.

649
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:20,340
Muad'Dib, the prophet.

650
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:22,840
Why is that a bad thing? Use it.

651
01:31:22,980 --> 01:31:23,980
It's not that simple.

652
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:26,940
You have the power to avenge
your father and you're afraid to use it.

653
01:31:28,170 --> 01:31:29,880
Spice opened my mind, Gurney.

654
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,000
I can foresee things.

655
01:31:34,350 --> 01:31:37,500
If I go south, all my
visions lead to horror.

656
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:40,860
Billions of corpses
scattered across the galaxy.

657
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:42,760
All dying because of me.

658
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:45,080
Because you lose control.

659
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:48,500
Because I gain it.

660
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:07,920
That's a lot of water.

661
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:11,560
Johnny.

662
01:32:11,780 --> 01:32:13,480
What? Academy's hopeless.

663
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:15,260
He's family.

664
01:32:15,261 --> 01:32:16,360
What?

665
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:20,020
Really?

666
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:49,070
You don't need to be a
prophet to see what's ahead.

667
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,280
Your path leads to war.

668
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:57,320
You know that.

669
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:00,820
So war is coming.

670
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:04,820
What will you do when you
feel its breath upon your neck?

671
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:12,760
If you don't want to raise an army in
this house, you still have an option.

672
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:17,500
Fire power.

673
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:20,760
Which you don't have.

674
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:24,060
And here I am.

675
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:30,480
I know where your father
hid the family atomics.

676
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:38,880
Every house possesses an atomic arsenal.

677
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:41,960
And I thought ours had been lost.

678
01:33:44,710 --> 01:33:46,840
It's huge, Johnny.
It could change everything.

679
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,980
And I could aim the bombs
at the main spice fields.

680
01:33:57,610 --> 01:34:00,700
He who can destroy a
thing has the real control of it.

681
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:03,820
So you can control it and not us?

682
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:07,741
You promised me you didn't want power.

683
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:11,880
No matter what I do,
you still don't trust me.

684
01:34:12,090 --> 01:34:14,300
Because you're a foreigner.
You're your friend.

685
01:34:17,070 --> 01:34:18,070
I'm not a foreigner.

686
01:34:26,210 --> 01:34:28,850
Not to me, but to the desert you are.

687
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:33,610
My allegiance is to you. To the Fremen.

688
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:35,890
I'm doing this for all of us.

689
01:34:37,270 --> 01:34:38,270
Do you believe me?

690
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:48,290
I'll talk to you so far.

691
01:34:55,610 --> 01:34:56,610
There.

692
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:03,970
It's right under everybody's noses.

693
01:35:06,130 --> 01:35:07,130
Not clever.

694
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:10,830
That's the idea. Nobody would ever
look in there because it's obvious.

695
01:35:13,570 --> 01:35:14,570
Not clever.

696
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:16,800
Did you find it?

697
01:35:17,260 --> 01:35:18,770
I didn't look for it.

698
01:35:19,370 --> 01:35:20,370
How many heads exactly?

699
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:24,250
Enough to blow up the whole planet.

700
01:35:27,630 --> 01:35:28,710
It's a figure of speech.

701
01:35:30,890 --> 01:35:31,890
You know what I mean.

702
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:55,660
Only with your genetic heritage.

703
01:36:35,450 --> 01:36:38,010
Your great-great-grandfather's legacy.

704
01:36:39,110 --> 01:36:42,490
The 92 original Atreides
family's atomic warheads.

705
01:36:45,970 --> 01:36:48,731
But that... That is power.

706
01:36:55,830 --> 01:36:56,830
Imperial diary.

707
01:36:57,910 --> 01:36:59,250
Near 10,191.

708
01:37:00,590 --> 01:37:01,590
Eighth comment.

709
01:37:02,450 --> 01:37:04,930
Reports from the south
of Arrakis arrive rarely.

710
01:37:06,270 --> 01:37:07,850
These are barren, burnt lands.

711
01:37:07,851 --> 01:37:12,170
Hidden by sandstorms which stretch
a thousand miles across the equator.

712
01:37:14,350 --> 01:37:16,110
Nothing can live there without faith.

713
01:37:17,890 --> 01:37:21,970
Which is why our Bene Gesserit
missionaries have been so productive there.

714
01:37:25,170 --> 01:37:28,724
Through them we are receiving
reports of a mysterious figure taking

715
01:37:28,736 --> 01:37:32,090
grip on the imaginations of the
southern fundamentalist tribes.

716
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:35,970
A new Reverend Mother from the north.

717
01:37:37,230 --> 01:37:40,670
Spreading word of the imminent
arrival of the Lusan Al-Ga'ib.

718
01:37:41,510 --> 01:37:42,870
The voice from the outer world.

719
01:37:44,410 --> 01:37:47,442
With religious fervor
rising in the south, and

720
01:37:47,454 --> 01:37:50,630
Wadiib strangling spice
production in the north.

721
01:37:51,670 --> 01:37:54,250
Everything points to the escalation of war.

722
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:05,800
A young, young woman who has been

723
01:38:06,050 --> 01:38:09,481
a young, young woman who has been a young,
young woman who has been a young woman.

724
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:10,540
What is it?

725
01:38:11,780 --> 01:38:12,780
With eyes?

726
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:18,900
You give that child a chance.

727
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:16,137
Listen carefully. Soon
a man is going to visit

728
01:40:16,149 --> 01:40:18,440
your temple and he may
want you to perform the rites.

729
01:40:18,441 --> 01:40:19,441


730
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:21,980
Reven mother, it is forbidden.

731
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:25,020
He mother shall let me.

732
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:29,580
He mother shall let me.

733
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:14,300
An old fashioned artillery, a genius, they're
literally melting rock on their heads.

734
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:15,960
I want to go on the ground.

735
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:18,240
Prepare my troops, Lord.

736
01:42:18,241 --> 01:42:20,400
I would recommend you stay inside those.

737
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:22,820
Bring his body to my quarters.

738
01:42:23,740 --> 01:42:25,460
My poor Darnax are hungry.

739
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:28,000
There's no food for them on the flight.

740
01:42:29,300 --> 01:42:31,180
What are you doing here?

741
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:33,120
It's early morning.

742
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:34,800
What are you doing here?

743
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:37,040
It's my feet, brother.

744
01:42:44,050 --> 01:42:46,570
You humiliated our family.

745
01:42:47,870 --> 01:42:49,290
You humiliated me.

746
01:42:49,291 --> 01:42:51,290
In case...

747
01:42:52,210 --> 01:42:54,150
I... ...won't die.

748
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:04,630
We're even up.

749
01:43:10,930 --> 01:43:13,610
And there is our family one more time.

750
01:43:14,970 --> 01:43:16,090
It will be the last.

751
01:43:55,710 --> 01:43:57,010
We'll be back in a few minutes.

752
01:44:03,580 --> 01:44:04,980
We've been waiting for a long time.

753
01:44:06,660 --> 01:44:08,640
We've been waiting for a long time.

754
01:44:08,641 --> 01:44:10,100
We've been waiting for a long time.

755
01:44:10,101 --> 01:44:11,101
We're waiting.

756
01:44:11,740 --> 01:44:12,740
We'll be back.

757
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:32,380
Ushul, in the south, only
leaders are allowed to speak.

758
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:35,320
You must take my place.

759
01:44:36,020 --> 01:44:36,800
I can't do that.

760
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:39,340
It is a good time to cross blades with me.

761
01:44:40,060 --> 01:44:42,240
I am weak, I am an easy kill.

762
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,420
I'd rather cut off my own hand.

763
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:47,720
We need you, we need the list
of Ganga'ib to lead our people.

764
01:44:47,721 --> 01:44:49,540
You know what I think of all that so long?

765
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:51,840
I don't care what you believe, I believe!

766
01:45:05,320 --> 01:45:07,320
I didn't see it coming.

767
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:10,760
The Harkins aren't done here.

768
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:13,360
They just went back to reload.

769
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:15,160
We're setting thumpers.

770
01:45:15,940 --> 01:45:17,456
We'll be moving everyone to the south.

771
01:45:17,480 --> 01:45:19,080
I'll stay behind and cover your retreat.

772
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,676
What are you talking about, Johnny?

773
01:45:20,700 --> 01:45:21,700
I can't go with you.

774
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:23,240
You know why? I'll stay too.

775
01:45:23,540 --> 01:45:25,920
Nobody stays with me.

776
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:27,160
Paul, that's an order!

777
01:45:27,220 --> 01:45:28,260
Gurney, how it goes south?

778
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:29,760
Protect my mother.

779
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:32,560
My lord.

780
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:33,840
What's the matter?

781
01:45:33,940 --> 01:45:35,000
I don't know what to do.

782
01:45:35,180 --> 01:45:36,340
I don't know what to do.

783
01:45:42,940 --> 01:45:44,300
He's afraid of the fundamentalist.

784
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:47,320
He should be.

785
01:46:00,650 --> 01:46:01,650
Don't resist.

786
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:20,670
Oh, son, son of a...

787
01:46:21,210 --> 01:46:23,550
You see what you've heard of us.

788
01:46:24,870 --> 01:46:26,530
You cannot see the future.

789
01:46:27,150 --> 01:46:28,610
You have seen the past.

790
01:46:31,330 --> 01:46:32,690
You are all your mind.

791
01:46:33,170 --> 01:46:34,770
You need to drink the water of life.

792
01:46:35,930 --> 01:46:38,110
And you will see everything.

793
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:45,180
The good hunter always learns
the highest tune before his hunter.

794
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:48,000
He needs to see.

795
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:51,500
As far as he can see.

796
01:46:56,540 --> 01:46:57,700
You need to see.

797
01:47:00,740 --> 01:47:02,540
You must drink the water of life.

798
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:29,220
Your mind and the world
has made choices for us.

799
01:47:35,390 --> 01:47:36,390
Tell them I'll lose you.

800
01:47:36,550 --> 01:47:42,120
You will never lose me.

801
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:44,380
Not as long as you stay where you are.

802
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:33,280
Spy, left behind.

803
01:48:34,220 --> 01:48:35,220
No trace of the others.

804
01:48:35,860 --> 01:48:37,860
They've gone south to hide in the storms.

805
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:44,720
Send this message to the Baron.

806
01:48:45,180 --> 01:48:47,020
The North has liberated and secured.

807
01:48:47,620 --> 01:48:48,780
Horace spies at will.

808
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:50,880
Yes, no Baron.

809
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:53,400
No sir.

810
01:49:05,210 --> 01:49:08,750
You killed nine of my
men with one single blade.

811
01:49:10,310 --> 01:49:11,310
She won't talk.

812
01:49:12,270 --> 01:49:13,270
Tell her that's fine.

813
01:49:13,970 --> 01:49:16,030
I already know everything I need to know.

814
01:49:24,020 --> 01:49:25,460
All in pleasure, imagine.

815
01:50:32,070 --> 01:50:33,940
So is she in the detail exit.

816
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:36,600
Is that who you are?

817
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:40,380
Who are you so like
to us? Without men.

818
01:50:45,310 --> 01:50:46,700


819
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Without men, they are just as bad as men.

820
01:52:31,260 --> 01:52:33,440
How do I have to talk to her?

821
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:34,720
So close!

822
01:52:36,020 --> 01:52:36,520
I won't go down to them.

823
01:52:36,521 --> 01:52:38,980
Don't tell them to.

824
01:52:38,981 --> 01:52:40,080
She's coming to me.

825
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Paul? Paul? I'm here.

826
01:53:11,945 --> 01:53:12,945
I'm here.

827
01:53:17,670 --> 01:53:18,670
What happened?

828
01:53:20,310 --> 01:53:21,310
What happened? He's dead.

829
01:53:32,060 --> 01:53:33,060


830
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:35,600
His vital signs are so
low they can't be detected.

831
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:37,440
But he's alive.

832
01:53:37,960 --> 01:53:38,960
What did you do
to him? No, not that.

833
01:53:40,770 --> 01:53:42,600
Why would he do that?

834
01:53:43,170 --> 01:53:45,400
Why would you do
that? I don't know.

835
01:53:45,401 --> 01:53:46,401
He's dead.

836
01:53:46,620 --> 01:53:47,620
I don't know.

837
01:53:48,020 --> 01:53:49,020
I don't know.

838
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:50,100
He's dead.

839
01:53:50,820 --> 01:53:51,160
He's dead.

840
01:53:51,580 --> 01:53:51,880
I don't know.

841
01:53:51,881 --> 01:53:56,260
Johnny, his body is fighting the
poison and he needs your help.

842
01:53:56,500 --> 01:53:57,500
You do it.

843
01:53:58,890 --> 01:53:59,900
You did this to him.

844
01:54:00,180 --> 01:54:01,460
You did this to your own son.

845
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:03,460
You do it. Fix it yourself.

846
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:07,500
Johnny, you might not believe in
the prophecy, but you're a part of it.

847
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:09,040
You're the poison.

848
01:54:09,780 --> 01:54:10,780
You and your lies.

849
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:12,400
Why would you do
this? She's a mother.

850
01:54:24,740 --> 01:54:25,740
Someone just.

851
01:54:26,720 --> 01:54:27,920
..

852
01:54:27,921 --> 01:54:28,921
She's a mother.

853
01:54:31,940 --> 01:54:33,920
You're not going to kill her, are you?

854
01:54:34,780 --> 01:54:35,940
You're not going to kill her.

855
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:38,520
Because it's very tears.

856
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:37,380
She'll come to understand.

857
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:40,260
I've seen it.

858
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:42,760
You can see.

859
01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:45,640
The visions are clear now.

860
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:51,420
I see possible futures all at once.

861
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:55,680
Our enemies are all around us.

862
01:56:56,220 --> 01:56:57,960
And in so many futures they prevail.

863
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:00,760
But I do see a way.

864
01:57:02,380 --> 01:57:04,220
There is a narrow way through.

865
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:16,340
I saw our bloodline mother,

866
01:57:17,790 --> 01:57:19,060
written across time.

867
01:57:37,010 --> 01:57:38,240
Did my father know?

868
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:47,430
I found myself until he
took the worm's poison.

869
01:58:01,240 --> 01:58:02,300
This is how we'll survive.

870
01:58:04,340 --> 01:58:05,640
By being our argument.

871
01:59:25,321 --> 01:59:26,321
We will survive.

872
01:59:46,380 --> 01:59:48,480
Do you hear me?
You have the power to stop this.

873
01:59:48,660 --> 01:59:49,660
No, I'm willing.

874
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:51,600
You're not going to
speak inside the circle.

875
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:53,656
If you were to speak, you know what to do.

876
01:59:53,680 --> 01:59:54,680
Still not, please.

877
01:59:55,700 --> 01:59:57,240
I can save him.

878
02:00:09,380 --> 02:00:11,740
This prophecy is how they enslave us.

879
02:00:12,160 --> 02:00:13,160
How they dominate us.

880
02:00:14,120 --> 02:00:15,880
You'll get yourself in trouble.

881
02:00:16,220 --> 02:00:17,260
This is not your business.

882
02:00:17,800 --> 02:00:19,648
My bond harkening
himself killed my family and

883
02:00:19,660 --> 02:00:21,480
gave me a bit of a start
of remembering mine.

884
02:00:21,740 --> 02:00:23,040
This is all of my business.

885
02:01:12,990 --> 02:01:18,410
You must take his place by defeating
him and returning his water to the well.

886
02:01:19,150 --> 02:01:22,910
You think I'm stupid enough to
deprive myself of the best of us.

887
02:01:23,550 --> 02:01:25,210
Did you not give me work somehow?

888
02:01:26,770 --> 02:01:28,170
I've taken my life or so long.

889
02:01:29,350 --> 02:01:30,450
It is the only way.

890
02:01:31,270 --> 02:01:32,550
I'm pointing the way!

891
02:01:36,250 --> 02:01:37,630
Ooh, that ass suck!

892
02:01:38,090 --> 02:01:39,110
Ooh, thou fizzy!

893
02:01:39,830 --> 02:01:41,010
They free pit!

894
02:01:41,450 --> 02:01:42,450
Call money!

895
02:01:59,320 --> 02:02:00,320
Die!

896
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:13,160
Do you think you could have a chance?

897
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:17,660
It's not the judge.

898
02:02:18,740 --> 02:02:19,740
It's the judge.

899
02:02:21,400 --> 02:02:24,660
She says that she's the only
one who wants to make it.

900
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:30,780
You're the one who wants to make it.

901
02:02:31,540 --> 02:02:35,480
You're the one who wants to make it.

902
02:02:39,380 --> 02:02:42,440
You're the one who wants to make it.

903
02:02:43,160 --> 02:02:44,600
I'm going to take it.

904
02:02:45,540 --> 02:02:46,540
I'll take it.

905
02:02:47,880 --> 02:02:49,980
Or I'll take it.

906
02:02:50,180 --> 02:02:51,880
I'll take it.

907
02:02:52,180 --> 02:02:53,220
I'll take it.

908
02:02:56,851 --> 02:02:57,851
The room.

909
02:02:58,350 --> 02:02:59,350
Is that the case?

910
02:03:01,510 --> 02:03:02,710
When you are ready,

911
02:03:05,830 --> 02:03:12,560
the judgeless want to make it.

912
02:03:12,561 --> 02:03:15,400
He will be the judge.

913
02:03:27,650 --> 02:03:29,580
You see the game, Shadi?

914
02:03:31,860 --> 02:03:33,160
I suck like I am.

915
02:03:34,260 --> 02:03:35,520
I should've been hooked.

916
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:44,440
This is my father's ducal signet.

917
02:03:55,220 --> 02:03:58,720
All my demon trees, duke of Arrakis!

918
02:04:00,040 --> 02:04:02,120
Everything did not have seen at me!

919
02:04:02,820 --> 02:04:04,280
Let me start my game!

920
02:04:05,240 --> 02:04:06,240
Ruined the ghetto!

921
02:04:06,241 --> 02:04:08,680
I should've been hooked.

922
02:05:06,280 --> 02:05:08,140
While Atreides is still alive,

923
02:05:10,350 --> 02:05:11,480
he challenges my father.

924
02:05:13,210 --> 02:05:14,480
You've never been on Arrakis.

925
02:05:16,470 --> 02:05:18,000
It's quite impressive, you'll see.

926
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:19,601
Was this all upon your advice?

927
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,000
What?

928
02:05:21,970 --> 02:05:24,700
Did you counsel my father
to exterminate the Atreides?

929
02:05:24,850 --> 02:05:25,850
Of course I did.

930
02:05:26,240 --> 02:05:27,520
Why else would it have happened?

931
02:05:28,395 --> 02:05:30,600
You tried to sacrifice an entire bloodline.

932
02:05:30,660 --> 02:05:32,260
And I was right to do it.

933
02:05:32,980 --> 02:05:37,620
The Kuisatzhaderak is a form of
power that our world has not yet seen.

934
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:39,860
The ultimate power.

935
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:43,880
The ninety generations we
have supervised have Atreides.

936
02:05:44,550 --> 02:05:47,111
They were promising, but they
were becoming dangerously defiant.

937
02:05:47,710 --> 02:05:49,540
Their bloodline had to be terminated.

938
02:05:51,110 --> 02:05:53,120
That is why we have put
many bloodlines at work.

939
02:05:53,121 --> 02:05:54,240
Several prospects.

940
02:05:54,860 --> 02:05:55,860
But it's backfired.

941
02:05:56,320 --> 02:05:57,320
Paul is alive.

942
02:05:57,780 --> 02:05:59,860
And if he defeats
Vader Arthur, my father...

943
02:05:59,861 --> 02:06:02,142
Your father will lose the
throne, no matter who prevails.

944
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:06,460
But there is one way your
family can remain in power.

945
02:06:06,820 --> 02:06:09,820
And through you, the
continuation of our stewardship.

946
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:14,260
One way are you prepared?

947
02:06:15,990 --> 02:06:18,180
He's been preparing me my
whole life for every mother.

948
02:06:21,110 --> 02:06:22,471
You heading north with
the others? I'm for Dyken.

949
02:06:23,140 --> 02:06:24,140


950
02:06:24,980 --> 02:06:27,220
I follow my leaders.
If fighting goes north, I go north.

951
02:06:28,340 --> 02:06:29,516
Paul didn't have a choice, child.

952
02:06:29,540 --> 02:06:30,660
I won't be fighting for him.

953
02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:32,920
I'm fighting for my people.

954
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:38,380
I came to wish you best of luck.

955
02:06:40,030 --> 02:06:41,030
I wish you the same.

956
02:06:43,120 --> 02:06:44,620
But it seems you've won your battle.

957
02:07:07,210 --> 02:07:08,530
You took the bait.

958
02:07:16,220 --> 02:07:17,300
The river is very obliging.

959
02:07:18,280 --> 02:07:19,540
It's right on time.

960
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:22,320
We're changing it more deep.

961
02:07:25,140 --> 02:07:26,380
I've sealed my colleague.

962
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:57,630
It's production under control.

963
02:07:59,770 --> 02:08:01,070
What do we do?

964
02:08:02,930 --> 02:08:04,610
Send messages to the great houses.

965
02:08:05,550 --> 02:08:07,910
Tell them that our
arachis is on a sonic attack.

966
02:08:09,530 --> 02:08:11,810
Tell them the future hangs to the balance.

967
02:08:34,300 --> 02:08:38,770
Tell them that our
arachis is on a sonic attack.

968
02:08:39,180 --> 02:08:40,520
When the storm hits this ridge,

969
02:08:41,820 --> 02:08:43,540
Gurney will open the way for you still are.

970
02:08:44,080 --> 02:08:45,800
So you can enter the basin from the west

971
02:08:46,440 --> 02:08:48,200
and distract their defense systems.

972
02:08:49,540 --> 02:08:51,860
Johnny, I want you and your
Phidike into that attack from the east.

973
02:08:53,040 --> 02:08:54,040
Inside the basin,

974
02:08:55,120 --> 02:08:56,700
I'll strike from the north, head on,

975
02:08:57,450 --> 02:08:58,690
with the fundamentalist troops.

976
02:08:59,460 --> 02:09:01,240
And I'll serve her a king for dessert.

977
02:09:02,040 --> 02:09:04,060
Remember, I need the Emperor alive.

978
02:09:05,300 --> 02:09:06,780
I don't wish he has something.

979
02:09:06,781 --> 02:09:10,120
I don't wish he has something.

980
02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:00,640
I don't wish he has something.

981
02:10:12,790 --> 02:10:13,790
No, no.

982
02:10:14,830 --> 02:10:19,310
You have any idea who this party could be?

983
02:10:20,250 --> 02:10:21,770
Something that is your majesty.

984
02:10:22,490 --> 02:10:23,110
That's all we know.

985
02:10:23,111 --> 02:10:24,111
More, more.

986
02:10:24,430 --> 02:10:25,010
Give me more.

987
02:10:25,370 --> 02:10:26,370
He's a madman.

988
02:10:26,890 --> 02:10:26,950
Mad?

989
02:10:27,250 --> 02:10:28,250
Or a familiar man.

990
02:10:30,790 --> 02:10:32,010
That's all you know.

991
02:10:32,830 --> 02:10:33,830
Really?

992
02:10:34,930 --> 02:10:36,030
No, Dave is dead.

993
02:10:38,810 --> 02:10:41,590
Or he went hiding in the southern storms.

994
02:10:41,930 --> 02:10:43,110
This means the same thing.

995
02:10:44,370 --> 02:10:45,370
Your majesty,

996
02:10:45,570 --> 02:10:48,510
the sandstorm that's approaching
threatens the integrity of our shields.

997
02:10:49,470 --> 02:10:51,450
We recommend going back into orbit.

998
02:10:51,451 --> 02:10:54,670
The mountains will
protect us from most of it.

999
02:10:55,150 --> 02:10:56,150
Your majesty.

1000
02:10:57,730 --> 02:11:00,330
Baron, have you ever investigated

1001
02:11:01,310 --> 02:11:04,170
the south regions of Aragas?

1002
02:11:05,370 --> 02:11:07,510
While the entire region is uninhabitable,

1003
02:11:08,010 --> 02:11:09,270
it's well known, your majesty.

1004
02:11:11,430 --> 02:11:13,370
Your uninhabited south

1005
02:11:14,450 --> 02:11:17,050
exhibits evidence of human activity.

1006
02:11:17,870 --> 02:11:18,990
I wasn't aware of this.

1007
02:11:19,850 --> 02:11:21,910
I swear to you, I wasn't aware of it.

1008
02:11:27,250 --> 02:11:28,670
Baron, Dave is alive.

1009
02:11:30,030 --> 02:11:31,470
I must find him.

1010
02:15:16,230 --> 02:15:21,850
He's alive.

1011
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:15,980
It's more than a day away.

1012
02:19:18,680 --> 02:19:19,680
I'm here.

1013
02:19:43,800 --> 02:19:48,490
Let's go.

1014
02:19:48,850 --> 02:19:48,910
Let's go.

1015
02:19:48,930 --> 02:19:51,570
I'm not going to touch you,

1016
02:19:52,050 --> 02:19:54,430
this is the end of it.

1017
02:19:56,430 --> 02:19:57,870
We have to keep going.

1018
02:20:10,690 --> 02:20:13,990
Amadri! Amadri! Amadri! Amadri!

1019
02:20:25,980 --> 02:20:26,980
.

1020
02:21:42,400 --> 02:21:47,060
And my friends.

1021
02:23:36,500 --> 02:23:40,920
I will love you as long as I breath.

1022
02:23:59,340 --> 02:24:01,500
You're facing a full invasion, Franklin.

1023
02:24:03,460 --> 02:24:06,080
How can you be so sure the
great houses are here for me?

1024
02:24:12,280 --> 02:24:15,380
They may be curious to hear my
side of the story, don't you think?

1025
02:24:16,680 --> 02:24:21,100
I am Paul Atreides, son of
Leto Atreides, Duke of Arrakis.

1026
02:24:22,770 --> 02:24:24,020
Gurney, my lord.

1027
02:24:24,540 --> 02:24:25,840
Send a warning to all ships.

1028
02:24:26,480 --> 02:24:30,360
If the great houses attack, our
atomics will obliterate all spice fields.

1029
02:24:32,400 --> 02:24:33,420
You're out of your mind.

1030
02:24:33,860 --> 02:24:34,800
He's bluffing.

1031
02:24:34,820 --> 02:24:36,880
Consider what you're
about to do, Paul Atreides.

1032
02:24:37,140 --> 02:24:38,140
What am I?

1033
02:24:46,690 --> 02:24:47,990
This upset, my lord.

1034
02:24:50,050 --> 02:24:54,150
As a servant of the Imperium,
you would know it might beat.

1035
02:24:54,350 --> 02:24:55,350
Your fate!

1036
02:24:55,850 --> 02:24:57,550
You'll be lucky to keep your head.

1037
02:25:00,970 --> 02:25:02,410
I'll take the hand of your daughter.

1038
02:25:04,750 --> 02:25:09,190
She will remain safe, and we
will rule together over the Empire.

1039
02:25:19,110 --> 02:25:24,700
But you, you have to answer for my father.

1040
02:25:39,420 --> 02:25:44,360
I killed him, because he was a
man that allowed us not meant to rule.

1041
02:25:46,080 --> 02:25:52,860
In other words, your father was a weak man.

1042
02:26:01,680 --> 02:26:04,860
Stand, or choose your champion.

1043
02:26:07,360 --> 02:26:09,060
I am here, Atreides.

1044
02:26:11,520 --> 02:26:14,960
I need a blade, except mine.

1045
02:26:26,280 --> 02:26:28,580
Do not stain your hands on the sand.

1046
02:26:50,540 --> 02:26:52,460
Why does he take such risks?

1047
02:26:53,840 --> 02:26:54,980
What deep lids?

1048
02:27:31,820 --> 02:27:33,800
You wouldn't be the
first Rajiv I've killed.

1049
02:27:36,800 --> 02:27:39,220
May thy knife chip and shatter.

1050
02:27:44,100 --> 02:27:46,660
May thy knife chip and shatter.

1051
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:17,780
I'll take the hand of your daughter.

1052
02:28:18,761 --> 02:28:20,201
I'll take the hand of your daughter.

1053
02:28:37,210 --> 02:28:38,210
She's your pet?

1054
02:28:54,790 --> 02:28:58,010
Any special attention for the pet?

1055
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:06,730
I'll take the hand of your daughter.

1056
02:30:23,400 --> 02:30:25,560
You thought well, Atreides.

1057
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:34,420
Listen, I gave you!

1058
02:31:28,840 --> 02:31:33,160
You should have believed.
You chose the wrong side.

1059
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:37,860
Side? You all people should know.

1060
02:31:39,300 --> 02:31:40,960
There are no sides.

1061
02:31:42,680 --> 02:31:43,680
Reverend Mother.

1062
02:33:39,240 --> 02:33:45,080
My lord, the great houses have answered.
They refuse to honor your ascendancy.

1063
02:33:46,740 --> 02:33:47,840
We have waited your orders.

1064
02:33:47,841 --> 02:33:48,921
We have waited your orders.

1065
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:59,940
Lead them to paradise.

1066
02:34:13,020 --> 02:34:16,080
Hold on! Hold on!

1067
02:34:16,081 --> 02:34:18,840
Listen to me!

1068
02:34:37,970 --> 02:34:42,750
Now we all begin.

1069
02:35:12,900 --> 02:35:17,200
Now we all begin.
