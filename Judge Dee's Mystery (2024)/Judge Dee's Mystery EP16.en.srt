You might not know

127
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,400
that there are three major factions

Apart from these three major factions,

133
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,600
there are over ten other factions
of various size.

Even I can't tell the specific number.

Has Lan Ward

139
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,920
always been fragmented

140
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,440
by rivaling factions?

141
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,960
In the past,

142
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,200
they were commanded by Heiyan.

143
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,640
Heiyan?

144
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,720
But for some reason,

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,120
five years ago,

146
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,360
they seemed to have suffered heavy losses.

147
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,200
Later on, they all disappeared.

148
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,400
Heiyan disappeared,

149
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,240
but someone has to rule over Lan Ward.

150
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,880
That's the reason
for the current fragmentation.

151
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,160
To consolidate their positions,

152
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,360
they are controlling
all kinds of business in Lan Ward.

153
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,960
They also take Anhua.

Business as usual.

195
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:20,920
Okay.

196
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,960
Go on.

197
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,280
Carry on.

198
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,720
Very good.

199
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,600
Cui, raise your hand higher.

200
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,960
My fault.

201
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,200
I didn't mean to steal your money.

202
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,960
I won't do it again.

203
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:01,500
[Red Pavilion]

204
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,220
[Red Pavilion]

205
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,380
[Ying]

206
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,720
Magistrate,

207
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,400
what are you doing?

208
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,200
I had nothing else to do just now.

209
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,560
So I drew the map of Lan Ward

210
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,120
according to my impression only.

211
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,920
I don't know

212
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,280
whether it is accurate or not.

213
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,400
Come here!

214
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,000
Mr. Hong,

215
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,480
protect Miss Cao and send her back
to her room.

216
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,600
Go. Follow quickly.

217
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,100
- What's going on?
- What happened?

218
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,340
What happened?

219
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,700
Gave me a fright.

220
00:14:59,280 --> 00:14:59,880
What's going on?

221
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,960
Mr. Li...

222
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,080
Come.

223
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,440
Sit down first.

224
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,200
Miss, don't be afraid.

225
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,720
Take your time to talk.

226
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,560
What did you see?

227
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,080
Stop!

228
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,040
Isn't it just for money?

229
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:16,640
Here you are.

230
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,200
You must be terrified.

231
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,000
Don't be afraid.

232
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,120
Find something to do.

233
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,360
Don't be afraid.

234
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,480
Tell us

235
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,800
what happened.

236
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,480
Just now, I came in to give him some food.

237
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,120
Mr. Li,

238
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,920
please have something to eat.

239
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,080
As soon as I entered the room,
I saw Mr. Li...

240
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,240
What's the relationship between you?

241
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,880
He once proposed to me in public.

242
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,640
Miss Qiu Yue,

243
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,960
I've made up my mind.

244
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,760
I will buy back your freedom
from Red Pavilion.

245
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,720
Then I will leave Lan Ward with you.

246
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,240
We will go to a faraway place.

247
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,720
These are the betrothal gifts.

248
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,080
They are all for you.

249
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,560
After we leave here,

250
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,360
I will marry you.

251
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,920
Only the two of us will live together.

252
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,000
Okay?

253
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,760
But I refused him.

254
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,040
Mr. Li,

255
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,240
thank you.

256
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,880
He committed suicide because of this.

257
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,840
It was all my fault.

258
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,720
You mean

259
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,440
Mr. Li

260
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,520
was trapped in love.

261
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,760
That was why

262
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,960
he committed suicide.

263
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,920
Is that what you mean?

264
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,160
Yes.

265
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,560
Do you have any basis

266
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,440
for this statement?

267
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,600
Previously,

268
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,920
he told me

269
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,440
he was writing a will to me.

270
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,040
I thought he was joking with me.

271
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,640
Are you copying the scriptures?

272
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,960
I'm writing a will.

273
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,760
It's to you.

274
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,720
Mr. Li,

275
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,240
don't joke with me.

276
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,720
Have you gone through anything

277
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,040
in this room?

278
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,680
No.

279
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,480
As soon as I came in...

280
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,400
Qiu Yue,

281
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,640
what happened to Mr. Li?

282
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,120
Well...

283
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,600
He has died.

284
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,360
He has died?

285
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:32,840
Qiu Yue,

286
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,280
in the past few days,

287
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,640
was there anything strange

288
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,520
about Mr. Li's behavior?

289
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,600
He was not in a good mood recently.

290
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,800
He often looked into the mirror...

291
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,360
Qiu Yue,

292
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,600
don't talk nonsense about him.

293
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,240
How could such a thing happen?

294
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,400
Bad luck.

295
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,160
You can go down first.

296
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,590
Wait.

297
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,440
Qiu Yue.

298
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,640
Qiu Yue usually took care
of Mr. Li's food and living.

299
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,590
Such a thing happened today.

300
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,110
She must be greatly terrified.

301
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,310
Sir,

302
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,680
it must have disturbed you, too.

303
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,560
Please go back to rest.

304
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,280
How can we rest?

305
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,160
Someone has died.

306
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,360
There should be people looking into this.

307
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,480
It's the local officials' business
to solve the case.

308
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,880
What does it have to do with you?

309
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,640
You should report the case right now.

310
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,920
The magistral office of Lan Ward
has long been burnt.

311
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,880
Even if we want to report the case,

312
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,440
we have to wait until tomorrow morning.

313
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,480
You don't understand this.

314
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,720
The crime scene...

315
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,320
I will lock up the room.

316
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,120
Before the officials come tomorrow,

317
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,560
no one is allowed to enter.

318
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,960
Nor will anyone

319
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,080
move Mr. Li's body.

320
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,720
I've been manager Red Pavilion
for over ten years.

321
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,840
Everything has been peaceful.

322
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,280
I will handle this

323
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,280
properly.

324
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,000
What did I say?

325
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,400
Our family can't do

326
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,680
without me.

327
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,080
The ink is not dry yet.

328
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,920
Mr. Li had written something
before he died.

329
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,120
He told me

330
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,680
he was writing a will to me.

331
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,240
I thought he was joking with me.

332
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,760
The lower part of the cut

333
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,640
is deeper than the upper part.

334
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,760
He seemed to have held the knife
with his right hand.

335
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,760
The blood has congealed,

336
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,040
but the ink is not dry.

337
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:17,920
Besides,

338
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,160
the wound

339
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,400
is not above the pool of blood.

340
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,440
Someone has moved the body.

341
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,520
He didn't commit suicide.

342
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,120
What's that?

343
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,000
Magistrate,

344
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
these are all evidences of debt.

345
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,720
Today, I borrowed 500 qian from Mr. Li.

346
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,680
No need to pay back.

347
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,960
Such a good thing.

348
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,280
No need to pay back the money you borrow.

349
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,280
Mr. Li might have lent
too much money to others.

350
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,320
He lost all the money

351
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,920
and couldn't make a living.

352
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,840
He could only commit suicide.

353
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,240
His wound

354
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,160
is not above the pool of blood.

355
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,920
Did you say that?

356
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,480
The blood has congealed,

357
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,560
but the ink on the table is not dry.

358
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,000
His body has been moved.

359
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,160
Obviously, he didn't commit suicide.

360
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,160
Did you say that?

361
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,560
That makes sense.

362
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,680
There is a needle hole on his neck.

363
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,480
Come and take a look.

364
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,320
That's not right.

365
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,760
There's no trace of other people entering.

366
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,840
Have you gone through anything

367
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,120
in this room?

368
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,000
No.

369
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,080
Qiu Yue

370
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,520
has lied.

371
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,720
[Magistrate assistant, Mr. Li]
Who are you?

372
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,880
Greetings. I am Li Luo,
the magistrate assistant of Lan Ward.

373
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,680
I didn't know you had arrived in Lan Ward.

374
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,520
I should have welcomed you earlier.

375
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,640
Please forgive me.

376
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,400
When was the magistral office destroyed?

377
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,160
Magistrate,

378
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,200
it was destroyed

379
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,440
early last month.

380
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,880
Where were you at that time?

381
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,120
Did you save

382
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,400
the documents?

383
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,120
Except for

384
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,480
the previous magistrate,

385
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,480
who abandoned
his official position and fled,

386
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,080
all others stayed in Lan Ward.

387
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,240
Magistrate, rest assured.

388
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,680
Tomorrow morning,

389
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,920
I'll ask them to report on their work.

390
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,700
[Red Pavilion]

391
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,800
Greetings, Magistrate Di.

392
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,400
You

393
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,280
reported the case

394
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,040
and asked Mr. Li to come?

395
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,000
You may not know it.

396
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,000
Although it's a pity

397
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,960
that Mr. Li has committed suicide,

398
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,880
I just wanted Mr. Li

399
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,960
to witness it.

400
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,440
Later on, we can explain it to his family.

401
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,760
Just to avoid trouble.

402
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,360
You said he had committed suicide?

403
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,880
Why are you so sure?

404
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,040
Didn't he commit suicide?

405
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,960
Do you know Mr. Li's background?

406
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,960
He is the same as you.

407
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,040
Also a lodger in Red Pavilion.

408
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,160
So far,

409
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,880
he has stayed here for 47 days.

410
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,400
I don't know

411
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,480
about anything else.

412
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,800
He has stayed here for so long.

413
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,560
Yet you know nothing

414
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,560
about him?

415
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,680
If a customer doesn't tell us,

416
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,200
how could we ask him?

417
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,960
If I ask everybody,

418
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,000
don't you have to show me

419
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,720
your letter of appointment?

420
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,920
I think I'm experienced in judging people.

421
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,480
Mr. Li was just like you.

422
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,880
He was gentle, kind,

423
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,080
and righteous.

424
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,640
He was very polite

425
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,920
to the ladies

426
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:19,960
and he loved Qiu Yue

427
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,280
deeply.

428
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,320
He never got close to other ladies.

429
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,640
He was truly a gentleman.

430
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,720
It's really a pity.

431
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,800
You may go get busy.

432
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,200
What is this woman's background?

433
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,600
You may not know it.

434
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,720
Biyu is a legendary figure

435
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,120
in Lan Ward.

436
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,760
She has been juggling
various forces for years.

437
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,840
That's how she was able to keep
Red Pavilion intact.

438
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,200
There are a lot of stories

439
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,440
about her.

440
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,240
There was a rich gentleman surnamed Lu.

441
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,280
He was deeply in love with Biyu.

442
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,240
He wanted to marry her.

443
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,240
But Biyu

444
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,520
didn't want to part
with the ladies of Red Pavilion.

445
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,560
She declined Mr. Lu.

446
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,800
No one could expect

447
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,640
Mr. Lu

448
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,280
had died for love

449
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,160
because of Biyu

450
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,600
right in Red Pavilion.

451
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,080
After that,

452
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,720
Biyu rose to fame.

453
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,320
She had a sudden rise in social status.

454
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:27,720
It was passed

455
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,920
from mouth to mouth with approbation.

456
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,000
The ladies here all tried to imitate her.

457
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,400
Then Mr. Li must be killed by Qiu Yue.

458
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,120
She wants to imitate Biyu.

459
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,400
So far,

460
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,680
there is no evidence to prove that.

461
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,480
Magistrate,

462
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,560
what should we investigate next?

463
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:55,780
[Red Pavilion]

464
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,160
Magistrate.

465
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,640
Magistrate,

466
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,080
shall we inspect Lan Ward today?

467
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,720
This is the emblem I found

468
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,720
below the signature on a painting
hanging in Li Tao's room.

469
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,640
If I remember correctly,

470
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,600
this is the emblem of Li Weijing,

471
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,400
the former governor of Tingzhou.

472
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,440
Is Li Weijing

473
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,320
from Lan Ward?

474
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,320
There was indeed

475
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,280
a Mr. Li in Lan Ward

476
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,720
who was once the governor of Tingzhou.

477
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,440
He has retired to his hometown.

478
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,080
Do you know where his home is?

479
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,680
Could Li Tao who has died

480
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,600
be from the Li family?

481
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,440
Do you know where his home is?

482
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,120
Yes.

483
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,440
Magistrate, please.

484
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,880
Our master grew all these flowers.

485
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,400
Magistrate, please.

486
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,960
Please.

487
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,240
Magistrate Di,

488
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,560
you've come from afar

489
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,360
to visit us.

490
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,680
I should have welcomed you earlier.

491
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,840
I've come without invitation.

492
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,040
Sorry for disturbing you.

493
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,240
I've resigned from office for many years.

494
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,480
I was no longer the governor.

495
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,640
It's about you son,

496
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,640
Li Tao.

497
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,320
I...

498
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,780
[Mr. Li]

499
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,640
I'm sorry for being impolite.

500
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,840
Magistrate Di,

501
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,600
do you know this flower?

502
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,400
Please tell me.

503
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,040
This kind of flower

504
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,720
is called tulip.

505
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,080
It is abundant in the Western Regions.

506
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,320
My wife loved them

507
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,680
before she passed away.

508
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,280
This kind of flower is my favorite.

509
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,720
I planted them in this place

510
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,280
and took care of them for many years.

511
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,680
They are finally blossoming.

512
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,280
Mr. Li.

513
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,920
When the tulip withers,

514
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,680
the spring

515
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,240
is about to end.

516
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,640
I'm in poor health.

517
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,040
I may not make it through this year.

518
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,280
My son

519
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,240
has been benevolent

520
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,240
since childhood.

521
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,600
If you want to take away what he loves,

522
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,200
he will offer it to you with both hands.

523
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,440
If you

524
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,560
beat him,

525
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,280
he just lets you do it.

526
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,360
He never fights back.

527
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,120
I once asked my son

528
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,920
why he was too weak

529
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,440
to fight back.

530
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,720
Guess

531
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,200
how my son answered.

532
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,920
My son said

533
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,760
that if he fought back,

534
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,840
there would never be an end

535
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,920
of taking revenge.

536
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,000
If he didn't

537
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,840
fight back

538
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,000
or ever

539
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,960
consider it,

540
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,720
he could win others' trust.

541
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,000
How could an innocent child

542
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,440
know the evils that lurk in the world

543
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,280
and in the human heart?

544
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,080
My son always feels

545
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,480
I'm too strict with him.

546
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,640
He was only close to his mother.

547
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,680
He seldom

548
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,160
talks to me.

549
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,600
Now,

550
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,360
he even ran away from home.

551
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,680
He didn't want to come back.

552
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,480
If you meet him,

553
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,840
please take care of him on my behalf

554
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,360
and persuade him to come home early.

555
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,400
After all,

556
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,600
he is my only son.

557
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:30,920
Magistrate.

558
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,400
Take care.

559
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,320
My Lord,

560
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,320
it has been arranged.

561
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,080
Investigate quickly.

562
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:52,880
Yes.

563
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,160
It wasn't easy for you.

564
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,160
We really

565
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,520
didn't know

566
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,880
how to tell this to Mr. Li.

567
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,000
I admire your sympathy

568
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,720
for him very much.

569
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,320
I've worked as an official
for seven years.

570
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,320
I've worked under five magistrates.

571
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,880
No one has changed
the situation in Lan Ward.

572
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,680
If you want to make a change,

573
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,200
I will do my best.

574
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,680
Magistrate Di,

575
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,720
what should we do next?

576
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,300
[Sealed by Lan Ward Magistral Office]

577
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,760
Thank you, Secretary Bai,

578
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,600
Mr. Po.

579
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,800
[Secretary Bai, Magistrate assistant Po]
Mr. Hong, you are welcome.

580
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,280
We will be colleagues in the future.

581
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,920
There are several more boxes of documents.

582
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,200
We will send them over tomorrow.

583
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:52,800
Okay.

584
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:53,960
Thank you.

585
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,200
Now that today,

586
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,680
Magistrate and Mr. Li
are away on business,

587
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,200
we will

588
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,240
report on our work tomorrow.

589
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,240
Okay.

590
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,480
I'll see you off.

591
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,560
Mr. Li,

592
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,080
may peace be with you.

593
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,360
May peace be with you.

594
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,000
Mr. Li,

595
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,230
may peace be with you.

596
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,880
May peace be with you.

597
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,880
Mr. Li had done a lot of good

598
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,080
to a lot of people.

599
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,200
Did you find anything

600
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,880
after going to Mr. Li's mansion?

601
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,840
I can't even tell him

602
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,360
Li Tao has died.

603
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,120
I may be disrespectful to the dead

604
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,720
if I say the following words.

605
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,840
But Li Tao's case

606
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,280
may be an opportunity for you.

607
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,200
A chance to break the ice

608
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,760
in Lan Ward.

609
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,320
What are these people

610
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,520
doing here?

611
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,880
Magistrate Di,
the new magistrate of Lan Ward,

612
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,760
is now holding court for cases.
