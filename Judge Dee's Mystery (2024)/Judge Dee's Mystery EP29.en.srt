[Judge Dee's Mystery]

2
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,980
[Based on the novel of the same name
by the Dutch author Robert van Gulik]

3
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:46,980
[Episode 29]

4
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,980
[This is a work of fiction.
Any resemblance is purely coincidental.]

5
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,060
Where are we

6
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,660
going?

7
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,180
No rush.

8
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,260
You will see him soon.

9
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,100
I solved a case before.

10
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,980
The criminal was called Diao Xiaoguan.

11
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,620
He was from Heiyan.

12
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,300
He also had an eagle.

13
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,140
His Heiyan tattoo

14
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,060
was on his tongue.

15
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,140
Maybe he wanted to hide it.

16
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,340
If he really wanted to hide it,

17
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,860
wouldn't it be better
to hide it in his heart?

18
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,580
What can be

19
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,500
better hidden

20
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,660
than an invisible mark?

21
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,820
Take it slow.

22
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,020
Sand

23
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:47,980
is difficult to walk on.

24
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,850
Aren't you in a hurry?

25
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,380
No.

26
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,420
I'll meet him anyway.

27
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,700
A little earlier or a little later

28
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,100
makes no difference.

29
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,380
Well,

30
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,140
let me tell you a new story

31
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,420
about Chu Lei.

32
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,500
He has been rebellious since childhood.

33
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,580
Later on,

34
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,980
he got to know a group of people

35
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,500
as rebellious as him.

36
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,220
They were all criminals.

37
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,500
They had

38
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,540
no mercy.

39
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,300
They tempered their will and their hearts

40
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,820
with frenzied killing.

41
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,700
He hated this world

42
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,940
because the first one that discarded him

43
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,580
was his father.

44
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,420
From then on,

45
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,780
it took all his strength

46
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,100
just to survive.

47
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,140
Such things

48
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,140
happened again and again.

49
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,860
He was always the only one
that survived in the end.

50
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,180
Killing

51
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,260
had become a habit.

52
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,010
In his heart,

53
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,300
besides sneering and mocking,

54
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,420
there was nothing but cruelty.

55
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,780
In the end, there was one thing

56
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,500
that had replaced everything else.

57
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,820
That was rage.

58
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,340
Magistrate,

59
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,020
between what you said and what I deduced,

60
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,820
is there any difference?

61
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:19,820
Yes.

62
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,180
In my version,

63
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,060
those who beat Chu Lei

64
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,780
were not soldiers from the border army

65
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,220
but Heiyan.

66
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,300
The one

67
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,060
he aspired to

68
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,340
and joined.

69
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,940
When did you find out about it?

70
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,540
After Chunyu's case

71
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,340
was solved.

72
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,180
You asked me

73
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,460
why

74
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,460
the Chu Lei in Chunyu's case

75
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,100
is so much different

76
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,060
from the Chu Lei you described.

77
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,540
Because everything you said

78
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,540
was made up by you.

79
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,700
The Chu Lei you described

80
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,740
is not Chu Lei at all,

81
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,020
but you.

82
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:44,980
You guys

83
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,820
are not human

84
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,180
but dirt.

85
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,980
Lin Fan.

86
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,980
You don't like this name, do you?

87
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,050
Your name is Di Ying,

88
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,300
right?

89
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,700
My brother.

90
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,860
[Lin Fan]

91
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,500
[Di Ying]

92
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,580
You guessed it all right.

93
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,100
My brother.

94
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,140
Di Renjie, you really live up
to your reputation as a brilliant sleuth.

95
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,420
You must have a lot of questions for me.

96
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,060
Who is Lin Fan?

97
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,100
Lin Fan is not important.

98
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,260
He was merely a soldier I had killed.

99
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,620
What's your name?

100
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,020
Heiyan only kills those
whose names are known to it.

101
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,940
My name is Lin Fan.

102
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,220
I'm begging you.

103
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,660
I can't join Heiyan.

104
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,900
I have a family to support...

105
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,420
What about Chu Lei?

106
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,140
Chu Lei

107
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,700
was just like you surmised.

108
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,660
He was just a good-for-nothing.

109
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,820
A scholar

110
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,220
who joined the army for a woman.

111
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,900
When he came to Lanfang County,

112
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,860
he was imprisoned.

113
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,260
He died a sudden death in prison.

114
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,620
It was I

115
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,660
who took care of his remains.

116
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:05,860
Why?

117
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,180
Why?

118
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,460
Because I wanted to become Lin Fan.

119
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,180
If I took care of his remains,

120
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,260
I would be Lin Fan.

121
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,380
Whether these two people

122
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,220
were good or bad is no longer important.

123
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,860
It's been such a long time.

124
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,380
A mere verbal statement is no guarantee.

125
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,420
I talk about them,

126
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,620
and they just become that way.

127
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:32,980
No.

128
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,100
How do you explain my wound?

129
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,340
You stabbed yourself.

130
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,380
You are very clever.

131
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,300
You've succeeded in clearing
my suspicions about you.

132
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,260
What about the weapon?

133
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,820
You hid it away.

134
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,420
Later on,

135
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,860
you put it by Cao An's bed.

136
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,980
Cao An is my witness.

137
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,060
There are so many

138
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,340
human-shaped sculptures
in your mason's shop.

139
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,820
It was not difficult

140
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:12,940
to deceive Cao An.

141
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,620
Lin Fan?

142
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,300
You killed Lin Fan?

143
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,420
There's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

144
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,700
Was it fun

145
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,860
to hide by my side?

146
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,540
That was really fun.

147
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,540
Besides,

148
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,580
it was very safe.

149
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,220
I also want to tell you one thing.

150
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,220
You let all the people in the county

151
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,540
wear Heiyan's mark.

152
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,980
The idea was brilliant.

153
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,620
You forced me

154
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,380
to meet you.

155
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,010
Are you really forced out by me?

156
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,170
Where is Cao An?

157
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,860
Renjie,

158
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,500
if you didn't come to Lanfang County,

159
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,780
I might spend the rest of my life here

160
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,100
as Lin Fan.

161
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,860
I love the old Lanfang County.

162
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,460
The strong prevailed

163
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,220
and the weak kept their place.

164
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,420
That's what Lanfang County should be.

165
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,580
The strong abide by the law,

166
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,380
and the weak

167
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,940
live and work happily.

168
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,620
The Code

169
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,500
maintains the order here.

170
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,580
That's the way I like.

171
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,540
The Code?

172
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,100
What is the Code?

173
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,260
Can you protect them forever?

174
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,620
You saved Wei,

175
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,380
Qiuyue, and Wangdong.

176
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,100
As a local official, you bring benefit
to the people in this place.

177
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,140
You will get promoted and leave.

178
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,700
What about them?

179
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,260
What about the next magistrate?

180
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,020
Will he still uphold the Code?

181
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,540
I don't think the previous magistrates

182
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,940
did so.

183
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,620
When a man is in power,

184
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,340
power goes to his head.

185
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,220
The Code.

186
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,060
The Code is nonsense.

187
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,780
The law of the jungle

188
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,580
is the way of the world.

189
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,300
The water in Lanfang County

190
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,980
is very precious.

191
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,300
You are right.

192
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,780
Ying.

193
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,180
Before I came, Lanfang County
was Lanfang County.

194
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,180
After I leave,

195
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,100
Lanfang County

196
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,860
will still be Lanfang County.

197
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,180
I know

198
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,380
it's very difficult
to change Lanfang County.

199
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,740
I just

200
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,700
want to do

201
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,020
what I can.

202
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,580
Your choice

203
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,500
is to be the guardian
of the old order of Lanfang County.

204
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,660
As for my choice,

205
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,380
it's hope itself.

206
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,180
There is good and evil in the human heart.

207
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,460
Evil

208
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,780
makes people kill each other.

209
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,780
It is goodness

210
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,660
that allows people to coexist.

211
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,100
The Code

212
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,900
guards

213
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,980
the goodness in people's hearts.

214
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,900
Nonsense.

215
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,220
This is the nonsense

216
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,420
Di Zhixun taught you!

217
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,660
It doesn't matter who taught me.

218
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,980
Choose what is good and hold fast to it.

219
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,220
There is nothing wrong with it.

220
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,180
Shut up.

221
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,340
If these lowly people
have good in their hearts,

222
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,460
will I succeed?

223
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,020
I just told them something unreasonable.

224
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,020
What was the result?

225
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,220
You saw it all.

226
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,820
You changed Lanfang County
beyond recognition

227
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,420
just so I could see it.

228
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,460
You changed it into a living hell.

229
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,500
Was it me who changed Lanfang County

230
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,780
into a living hell?

231
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,420
It was their hearts

232
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,300
that had changed this place
into a living hell.

233
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:14,860
I want to tell you

234
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,500
that all this

235
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,020
is the way of Heaven.

236
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,180
I finally understand

237
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,460
why our father kicked you
out of the house back then.

238
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,940
What did you say?

239
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:35,980
I often remember

240
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,020
how you left home back then.

241
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,580
You're no longer

242
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,340
a member of our family.

243
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,820
Maybe this is the only way

244
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,420
to keep him alive.

245
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,460
Very pitiful.

246
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,780
Say it again.

247
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,620
Our father kicked you
out of the house back then.

248
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,780
He was right to do so.

249
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,660
Ying,

250
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,020
you are really pitiful.

251
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,300
Is this the Rain Dragon Sword

252
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,380
Di Zhixun gave you?

253
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,420
It is as useless

254
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,300
as you.

255
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,540
I will definitely

256
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,860
arrest you today.

257
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,340
I'm not guilty.

258
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,580
I have never killed anyone.

259
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,980
I have no Heiyan tattoo, either.

260
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,900
You spent your life

261
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,900
advocating the Tang Code,

262
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,220
but it cannot convict me.

263
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,100
Nor can you save Cao An.

264
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,300
How about this?

265
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,460
You kill me yourself

266
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,620
to prove the Code is useless.

267
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,060
Isn't it wonderful?

268
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,820
Kidnapping

269
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,580
is also against the Code.

270
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,260
How do you know she is unwilling?

271
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,060
Oh right.

272
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,580
Didn't she tell you anything
between us before?

273
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,980
Renjie,

274
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,860
is this the best you can do?

275
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,740
If you still don't go all out,

276
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,660
I'll cut Cao An's throat.

277
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,860
Thickheaded.

278
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:03,940
Today,

279
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,100
I'll let you see Di Zhixun
in the netherworld!

280
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,620
You

281
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,860
wanted to arrest me.

282
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,300
In the end,

283
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,860
you delivered this fatal blow.

284
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,460
Who is guilty,

285
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,180
you

286
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,260
or me?

287
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,700
The way of Heaven

288
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,900
is not wrong.

289
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,020
You

290
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:54,850
are not wrong.

291
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,090
Di Zhixun

292
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,260
was not wrong, either.

293
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,180
It is human nature

294
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,540
that is wrong.

295
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,090
Where is Cao An?

296
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,500
Where is Cao An?

297
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,100
I thought

298
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,980
the Di family

299
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,260
was just where I came from.

300
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,980
I didn't expect

301
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,060
it was also

302
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,860
my destination.

303
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,660
[Young Di Renjie]
I also want a sword.

304
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,300
Just like you.

305
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,420
[Young Di Ying]
You can't be like me.

306
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,700
You should follow Father's words.

307
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,860
Study hard in the future

308
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,980
and be a person he considers useful.

309
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,260
Come.

310
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,420
Ying, slow down.

311
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,140
Come here.

312
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:27,820
Wait for me.

313
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,420
Is Bingzhou

314
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,140
your hometown?

315
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,700
There is a special custom in Bingzhou.

316
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,780
The corpses are left in the suburbs
for birds and beasts to eat.

317
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,140
No need to worry in this world.

318
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,620
Make light of life and death
as well as the corporeal body.

319
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,900
This is the mood of the music.

320
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,740
My hometown

321
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,860
is just a place

322
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,980
in my memory.

323
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,940
[Ying]

324
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,700
Skylarks miss their home

325
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,540
the most.

326
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,420
No matter where they are taken,

327
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,900
they will do whatever it takes

328
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,260
to fly back home.

329
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,580
The bird will be able to fly home

330
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,060
if we cure it.

331
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:37,100
[Ying]

332
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,060
Nonsense.

333
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,060
This is the nonsense Di Zhixun taught you.

334
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,940
I just told them something unreasonable.

335
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,340
Was it me who changed Lanfang County
into a living hell?

336
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,460
The water in Lanfang County
is very precious.

337
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,940
To meet you.

338
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,220
The Code is nonsense.

339
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:00,700
Why?

340
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,420
That all this

341
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,580
is the way of Heaven.

342
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,100
If you didn't come to Lanfang County,

343
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,540
I might spend the rest of my life here

344
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,980
as Lin Fan.

345
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,980
Huaiying.

346
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,540
Where is my sword?

347
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,260
That's weird.

348
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,980
Where is it?

349
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,420
Huaiying,

350
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,220
I'm asking you.

351
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,340
Where is my sword?

352
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,060
Is it here?

353
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,820
Why can't I find it?

354
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,540
[Lanfang County Magistrate's Office]

355
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,900
It is said that wearing Zhuyu
on the Double Ninth Festival

356
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,740
can drive away evil spirits

357
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,820
and pray for eternal life.

358
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,180
I don't know whether it is true.

359
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,660
Zhuyu is also called Wuyu.
[*plant Cornus officinalis]

360
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,900
It is spicy and can be used as medicine.

361
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,540
Just because

362
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,500
it is spicy and flavorful,

363
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,980
people think it is powerful.

364
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,660
So they pin their hopes on it.

365
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,300
Today is the Double Ninth Festival.

366
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,940
Will you climb the hill with us?

367
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,940
If you want to climb the hill,

368
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,620
go to the front office now
and take care of business.

369
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,500
There is a lot to do today.

370
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,500
Qiao Tai can't finish all of it.

371
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:06,980
Yes, Sir.

372
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:08,860
Miss Cao,

373
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,540
I've consulted a fortune-teller.

374
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,300
Both of your Ba-Zi

375
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,540
belong to the Yin category.

376
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,820
Easy to get into trouble.

377
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,380
The ninth month

378
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,060
is purely Yang in nature.

379
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,540
Perfect for weddings.

380
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:21,660
So,

381
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,020
please choose a date.

382
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,500
It's the ninth day today.

383
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,940
Should we be in such a hurry?

384
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,620
If you had been in a hurry before,

385
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,300
you wouldn't have to now.

386
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,860
Please choose a date.

387
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,100
Let Huaiying make a decision

388
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,500
for the matters concerning our wedding.

389
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,540
Please choose a date.

390
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:02,980
You choose.

391
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,620
You don't even ask me
what the date is for.

392
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,900
How can I choose a date for you?

393
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,620
The 20th day of this month.

394
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,420
The 20th day.

395
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,020
There will be a total solar eclipse
on the 20th day.

396
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,060
The extreme of Yin and darkness.

397
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,420
No way.

398
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,060
Let Miss Cao decide

399
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,940
on the date of the wedding.

400
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,060
I can't tell Miss Cao what to do,
but I can give you a piece of my mind.

401
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,100
Now that you and Miss Cao

402
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,500
have decided to get married.

403
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,260
You should hold the wedding
as soon as possible.

404
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,700
Why do you keep postponing it?

405
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,140
You are not sincere enough.

406
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,180
Fine.

407
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,620
I know you have a load on your mind.

408
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,340
But the dead is gone...

409
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:50,700
Enough.

410
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,180
You can't un-ring...

411
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,660
Let's not talk about this.

412
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,100
If you keep postponing it,

413
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,380
it can never happen.

414
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:03,860
I...

415
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,460
He taught you

416
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,340
that Bingzhou ditty?

417
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,140
He just taught me how to sing it,
nothing more.

418
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,220
So

419
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,660
I didn't mention it.

420
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,900
You should have told me.

421
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,380
It is written
in "Records of the Supernatural"

422
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,180
that there is a rare spring
south of Lanfang County.

423
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,820
It looks like the crescent moon

424
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,140
and is never dry.

425
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,260
Scoop a goblet of spring water

426
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,420
and the heart will be reborn.

427
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,540
One can realize

428
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,020
one's wish.

429
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,380
If there is nothing to worry about,

430
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,980
there will be nothing to be afraid of.

[Crescent Spring]

432
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,180
Scoop a goblet of spring water

433
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,100
and there is nothing to worry about?

434
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,140
We will know

435
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,380
if we give it a try.

436
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,260
The Crescent Spring

437
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,860
is not far away from us.

438

If we hurry,

439
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,820
it will take us five days to arrive there.

440
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,580
Let's go for a visit.

441
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,380
Just take it as a distraction.

442
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,140
Okay.

443
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,100
You are heading

444
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,940
towards Anxi this time.

445
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,620
The north of the mountains
and the south of the water are Yin.

446
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,340
You must be very careful on the road.

447
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,700

450

Don't worry. We will be careful.

451
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,780
Mr. Hong,

452
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,580
don't worry.

453
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,300
They are going to the Crescent Spring
for sightseeing.

454
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,900
Why would they offend those things?

455
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,380
Take it slow.

456
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,100
Magistrate.

457
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,220
Be careful on the road.

458
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,020
Remember, don't go to Buddhist
or Taoist temples.

459
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,260
Mr. Hong,

460
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,260
when did you start to believe
in such things?

what's the matter?

464
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,860
The Magistrate forgot to take
the Rain Dragon Sword with him.

465
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,100
He forgot it deliberately.

466
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,140
If this is the case,
it is arranged by heaven.

467
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:36,020
It is to let them
overcome the tribulation.
