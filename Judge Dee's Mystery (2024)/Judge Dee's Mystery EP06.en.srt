00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,390
Magistrate,

7
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,040
please sentence me to death.

8
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,360
Please rise.

9
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,920
Please tell me

10
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,280
what happened last night.

11
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,630
It rained heavily last night.

12
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,630
I was writing in my study.

13
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,310
Unexpectedly, I had an attack of madness.

14
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,790
I killed her.

15
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,310
It must be me who killed her.

16
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,750
Magistrate, please

17
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,240
don't be merciful

18
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,110
and sentence me to death.

19
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,080
Mr. Teng.

20
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,720
Rise, Mr. Teng.

21
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,760
The case is still unclear.

22
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,760
I beg your pardon.

23
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,550
I can't close the case and sentence you.

24
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,440
Why don't you go back and rest?

25
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,510
I'll

26
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,120
get to the bottom

27
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,080
of this case.

28
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:04,680
Please

29
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,040
sentence me to death.

30
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,400
Powder.

The victim's

34
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,000
fingertips, ears,

35
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,030
and hairs

36
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,910
all found white powder.

37
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,750
Seven stabs.

38
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,910
Why both seven stabs?

39
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,880
Magistrate,

40
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,190
there's no smell.

41
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,270
Teng Kan confessed

42
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,960
to killing his wife due to madness.

43
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,160
We can close the case, right?

44
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,390
Then

45
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,830
why did the screen change for no reason?

46
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,440
Who left the footprints outside the window

47
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,320
and entered the study to move the body?

48
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,360
So many mysteries remain unsolved.

49
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,880
Close the case?

50
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,390
Di Renjie.

51
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,440
I know you're here.

52
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,000
You've won a lot.

53
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,720
I won it all on my own.

54
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,030
It's legal and all voluntary.

55
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,440
Also,

56
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,320
let me tell you something.

57
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,270
My case

58
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,190
is closed.

59
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,520
By whom?

60
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,390
The one who set the rules.

61
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,750
Still want to bet?

62
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,910
The Jianghu power

63
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,910
is not a child's play.

64
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:43,960
If you still want to bet,

65
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,910
let's do it differently.

66
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,360
What else do you want to bet?

67
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,030
Let's bet on the case you're working on.

68
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,320
If Di Renjie

69
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,720
can solve the unidentified body case

70
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,390
and find the real culprits,

71
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,630
then he'll be in charge

72
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,750
of the Jianghu I control now.

73
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,320
But if he can't solve it,

74
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,950
I don't want anything from you.

75
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,440
The government,

76
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,480
the Jianghu,

77
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,160
each minds its own business.

78
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,070
I accept.

79
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,000
If

80
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,510
you solve the unidentified body case,

81
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,480
you'll be in charge of Penglai County

82
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,830
after that.

83
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,390
Otherwise?

84
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,480
Here are three bronze dice.

85
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,110
For each dice,

86
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,230
I'll do one thing for you.

87
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,390
Within a 50-li radius,

88
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,320
you can ask anyone.

89
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,670
No one dares to refuse me.

90
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,640
I didn't expect you to be so decent.

91
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,600
Thanks.

92
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,670
Wait.

93
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,880
With three dice,

94
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,550
you can only do three things.

95
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,000
Don't try to trick me.

96
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,670
No ''otherwise''.

97
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,480
You're Di Renjie.

98
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,600
You can solve this case for sure.

99
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,790
You have to work hard,

100
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,440
Huaiying.

101
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,070
The money from betting

102
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,110
is not loot.

103
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,040
The boots I bought with it

104
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,480
are not loot either.

105
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,350
These

106
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,230
aren't dirty.

107
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,160
Where are you going?

108
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,230
To change my boots.

109
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,510
Ma Rong,

110
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,270
dogs

111
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,440
are good in every way,

112
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,670
but they love to eat shit.

113
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,670
If this problem is corrected,

114
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,830
dogs

115
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,480
will be good in every way.

116
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,160
Di Renjie,

117
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,640
what do you mean?

118
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,160
Thanks.

119
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,320
Mr. Teng, you've

120
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,040
been grieving too much

121
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,640
and had a relapse.

122
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,270
You should take care of yourself.

123
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,070
That's all right.

124
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,550
Magistrate, do you know?

125
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,600
20 years ago,

126
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,600
when I was in the capital,

127
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,040
I met your father a few times.

128
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,320
Your father

129
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,230
was an honorable man.

130
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,550
I still

131
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,640
remember his face and voice.

132
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,000
Back then,

133
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,350
I was the Secretary General
of the Right Guards.

134
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,830
My name was Teng Zhongyuan.

135
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,110
Wild geese flying south,
I grieve my snow-white hair.

136
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,550
On the lonesome frontier,
mountains and the moon seem so close.

137
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,880
The heavens and the earth fall
into the dark night.

138
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,950
Live and die side by side,
hoping for eternity.

139
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,440
Since my father passed away,

140
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,160
this poem has always been with me.

141
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,510
It's my good fortune

142
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,350
to meet his old friend today.

143
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,510
But

144
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,390
I don't know why...

145
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,720
You don't know why

146
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,670
I switched from the battlefield

147
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,480
to writing and romance, right?

148
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,200
Yes.

149
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,550
Yinlian changed me.

150
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,920
Ever since I married her,

151
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,000
I didn't want to get involved

152
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,160
in the battlefield anymore.

153
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,550
So I changed my name

154
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,270
and only wanted to be a mediocre man

155
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,950
who indulges himself in her charm

156
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,270
and writes love letters.

157
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,790
Now that I'm over 50,

158
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,510
I only want to spend the rest

159
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,760
of my life with Yinlian,

160
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,830
nothing else.

161
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,350
But now I've ruined it

162
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,230
all with my own hands.

163
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,270
I still have one question.

164
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,600
Why did you take the blame

165
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,070
on yourself?

166
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:11,920
Magistrate,

167
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,440
even if you don't sentence me,

168
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,950
Heaven will.

169
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,200
I killed my beloved wife
with my own hands.

170
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,670
I was ungrateful and wronged her.

171
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,440
Instead

172
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,640
of suffering every day

173
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,550
and living alone,

174
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,590
I'd rather die earlier

175
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,790
and meet Yinlian in the afterlife.

176
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,910
I

177
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,150
beg you,

178
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,840
for the sake of my friendship
with your father,

179
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,230
please sentence me to death.

180
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,840
I

181
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,080
thank you.

182
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,350
No, Mr. Teng.

183
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,000
Since I'm an official,

184
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,000
I should follow the laws.

185
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,230
You were once an official.

186
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,520
You should

187
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,400
know the Tang Code.

188
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,030
By the Tang Code,

189
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,320
if a patient of madness
injures a one's life,

190
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,030
the punishment should be lenient.

191
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,000
Your fame has spread far and wide.

192
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,760
People all over the county
have petitioned for you.

193
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,520
For all reasons,

194
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,350
I should acquit you.

195
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,400
My life is still alive,

196
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,470
but my heart is dead.

197
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:30,960
There's one thing

198
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,350
I'd like you

199
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,710
to tell me honestly.

200
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,640
You want to ask

201
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,400
about the Four-panel Screen?

202
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,840
Exactly.

203
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,760
Over ten years ago,

204
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,150
I saw that lacquer screen

205
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,840
by chance in a store.

206
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,400
Spring,

207
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,640
summer,

208
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,710
fall,

209
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:58,670
winter,

210
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,520
four lacquer paintings.

211
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,400
The story in the paintings

212
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,200
was the same as the one

213
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,550
between Yinlian and me.

214
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,150
We saw each other in a dream

215
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,350
and met each other on the balcony.

216
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,280
There are four sisters in the painting.

217
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,670
Before Yinlian married,

218
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,440
she and her three sisters
lived in her family.

219
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,790
Tell me.

220
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,840
If this is not the story
of Yinlian and me,

221
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,320
what else could it be?

222
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,520
Because of all these coincidences,

223
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,550
I decided that this lacquer screen

224
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,840
must only belong to me and Yinlian.

225
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,400
So I bought it.

226
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,590
But who would have thought?

227
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,320
A few days ago,

228
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,110
this wine cup

229
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,030
changed into a sword

230
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,520
and stabbed her in the chest.

231
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,150
Master.

232
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,470
Today,

233
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,440
I'm feeling fine.

234
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,400
No need to drink medicine.

235
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,880
But Madame herself asked me to...

236
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,030
Madam.

237
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,590
I've told you.

238
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,670
No need to drink medicine.

239
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:19,880
But

240
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,000
Madam said...

241
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,000
Madam said.

242
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,520
Madam said.

243
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,470
Madam said!

244
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,000
Madam said!

245
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,880
Madam said!

246
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,550
Madam said!

247
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,590
My lord,

248
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,960
drink the medicine.

249
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,790
Drink it and you'll be fine.

250
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,880
You drink.

251
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,710
I said no, no!

252
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,080
My lord,

253
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:38,710
it's fine.

254
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,350
I'm sorry.

255
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:43,840
Yinlian,

256
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,550
I'm sorry.

257
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,320
Alright.

258
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:00,150
This...

259
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,280
Screen!

260
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,440
The Four-panel Screen!

261
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,470
My lord.

262
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,150
Look, my lord.

263
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,030
How did this happen?

264
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:40,960
My lord.

265
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:43,440
My lord.

266
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,280
My lord.

267
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,470
My lord.

268
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,320
Evil spirit!

269
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,520
Evil spirit!

270
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,550
An evil spirit possesses Master!

271
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,030
Master.

272
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,400
At that time,

273
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,550
my madness was getting worse.

274
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,470
I was afraid

275
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,470
that I'd kill Yinlian

276
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,030
as the screen predicted.

277
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,400
So I had the servants lock

278
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,520
up the screen in the storehouse.

279
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,150
In the end,

280
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,960
I still lost my mind.

281
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:44,710
Mr. Teng,

282
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,840
[Notice]
do you know the man in this painting?

283
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,080
Mr. Teng knows my father.

284
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,230
Why didn't you tell me?

285
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,710
Master had many friends.

286
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,960
How could I remember all of them?

287
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,280
Not to mention

288
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,440
that it was over 20 years ago.

289
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,230
But Teng Zhongyuan's ancestor

290
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,590
was quite famous.

291
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,640
Tell me.

292
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,470
It was the 13th year of the Zhenguan era.

293
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,280
Teng Zhongyuan's ancestor

294
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,440
was the Deputy Chief
of the Imperial Guards of Jiannan Circuit.

295
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,670
He had a promising career ahead of him,

296
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,790
but he fell ill with madness.

297
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,670
He had an attack at night,

298
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,640
broke into the barracks,

299
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,200
and killed 17 soldiers in a row,

300
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,150
causing a mutiny.

301
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,000
Teng Zhongyuan's ancestor

302
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,550
committed suicide to apologize.

303
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,400
From his pulse, it seems like

304
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,590
the yin deficiency concentrates
on the lower body.

305
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:08,760
The yang hyperactivity concentrates
on the upper body.

306
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,640
It's indeed madness.

307
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,350
If so,

308
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,760
the disease

309
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,590
will be passed on to the descendants.

310
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,350
Is this

311
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,710
why Teng Zhongyuan and Yinlian

312
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,280
have no children?

313
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,440
Before Yinlian married,

314
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,960
she and her three sisters
lived in her family.

315
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,110
It's just like what is depicted
on this screen.

316
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,080
Stop.

317
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,830
Stay away.

318
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,100
[Lai's Ancestral House]
This is Yinlian's ancestral home

319
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,040
before she married.

320
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,310
[Lai's Residence]

321
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,760
Now, only her
unmarried second sister lives here.

322
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,110
Everyone calls her Ms. Lai Er.

323
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:25,180
[Lai Er]

324
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,000
Ms. Lai Er,

325
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,710
this is Magistrate Di,
the magistrate of Penglai.

326
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,310
We're here today...

327
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,880
I know who you are.

328
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,400
I also know what you want to ask.

329
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,400
You're investigating Yinlian's murder,

330
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,280
right?

331
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,230
You know she's dead?

332
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,830
The great poet Teng Kan's wife is dead.

333
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,520
It's a big news.

334
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,470
Who can you hide from?

335
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,640
Why are you laughing?

336
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,640
Can't I laugh?

337
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,110
She deserved it.

338
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,560
It's retribution.

339
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:06,830
Retribution?

340
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,070
She was

341
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,350
a woman of easy virtue.

342
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,230
Magistrate, thank you.

343
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,800
With her beauty,

344
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,520
she was always flirting with people.

345
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,280
Many people had affairs with her.

346
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,920
Many also hated her.

347
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,280
But I heard

348
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,640
Mrs. Yinlian

349
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,230
was a woman of good character

350
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,110

She was never

I don't like Yinlian,

However,

there was a man called Li Han.

He had an adulterous relationship
with Yinlian.

He was her suitor before she married,

00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,560
Didn't you eat?

526
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,000
Move!

527
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:12,710
Hurry up.

528
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:18,950
Quick.

529
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,230
Hurry up.

530
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,190
What are you doing?

531
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,070
Hurry up.

532
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,160
Who told you to sit down?

533
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,350
Don't dawdle.

534
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,040
You. Speed up.

535
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,160
Hurry up.

536
00:30:59,190 --> 00:30:59,800
Hurry up.

537
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:01,950
I'll whip you. Don't dawdle.

538
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:02,880
Come here.

539
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,110
Magistrate Di.

540
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
This isn't an office.

541
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,430
I don't have food or wine to welcome you.

542
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,350
It's a mess.

543
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,190
If you don't have any problems,

544
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,590
please go back.

545
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,710
You're joking, Mr. Chen.

546
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,560
I'm here

547
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,830
to see a prisoner,

548
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,310
Li Han.

549
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,920
Do you have the provincial governor's
official letter?

550
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,040
Of course, I have.

551
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,640
However, Mr. Chen,

552
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,640
if you see the letter

553
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,950
but don't let me see him,

554
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,800
I don't need to tell you

555
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,680
what's involved, right?

556
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,190
Hurry up.

557
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,430
Qiao Tai,

558
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,110
fetch the official letter.

559
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,560
I have hundreds and thousands

560
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,520
of prisoners here,

561
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,830
so I can't remember everyone's name.

562
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,160
Someone,

563
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,110
go

564
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,590
and bring that Li Han to me.

565
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,680
Have you forgotten?

566
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
This Li Han

567
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,070
got leprosy

568
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,190
and was dead.

569
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,760
Right.

570
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,590
Right.

571
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,800
I forgot about that.

572
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,350
Magistrate Di,

573
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,710
it's not that I don't want you to see him.

574
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,830
You heard it.

575
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,560
He's dead.

576
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,310
Then take me to his grave.

577
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,350
This Li Han

578
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,950
has been involved in many murders.

579
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,590
I dare not to be negligent.

580
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:33,830
Mr. Chen,

581
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,350
thank you.

582
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,950
Follow me.

583
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,520
Mr. Chen, it's here.

584
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,920
Magistrate.

585
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,760
How long has he been dead?

586
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,110
Ten days?

587
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,430
20 days.

588
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,520
Fresh soil.

589
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,190
If I want to dig up the grave
and check the body,

590
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,280
Mr. Chen,

591
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,950
can you do me a favor?

592
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:29,430
Magistrate,

593
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,470
I'm afraid that's against the rules.

594
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,470
Yes.

595
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,830
I've gone beyond my authority.

596
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,560
I have a list of prisoners in my room.

597
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,880
If you don't believe me,

598
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,070
you can check it.

599
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,590
That won't be necessary.

600
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,880
Since I'm here and I've seen it,

601
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:49,710
I've

602
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,160
done my job.

603
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,880
I appreciate your understanding.

604
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,470
Let's go.

605
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:02,430
Thank you very much.

606
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:14,800
Magistrate,

607
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,880
what do we do now?

608
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:27,800
Magistrate.

609
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,040
Dig the grave.

610
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,310
Dig the grave?

611
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,950
The quarry is heavily guarded.

612
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,470
It's hard to get in again.

613
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:35,470
Let's wait.

614
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:36,760
In a while,

615
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,470
someone should be here to show us the way.

616
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,430
Magistrate.

617
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:49,640
Magistrate,

618
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,000
you know Bazong?

619
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,640
He's a friend of mine.

620
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,830
If that's the case,

621
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,520
it's not a waste for me to risk my life.

622
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,070
Magistrate,

623
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,710
you want to dig up the grave
and check the body?

624
00:34:59,190 --> 00:34:59,560
Yes.

625
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:01,950
There's a path ahead

626
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,760
that leads to the mass grave.

627
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,350
Please

628
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,070
follow me.

629
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:06,560
Please.

630
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,560
Magistrate.

631
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:22,680
Dig.

632
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,230
Magistrate,

633
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:38,710
this place is heavily guarded.

634
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,560
If he didn't die of illness,

635
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,230
then Mr. Chen must have let him go.

636
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,000
This kind of thing

637
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,590
happens all the time.

638
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,920
I'm a petty man.

639
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,590
I don't know much about it.

640
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:45,160
Magistrate,

641
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,590
that's all I can do for you.

642
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,000
You're willing to take such a risk.

643
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,040
Is it to help me

644
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:53,430
or for Bazong?

645
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,630
Bazong helped my family a lot.

646
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,320
I should return the favor.

647
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,230
It's the right thing to do.

648
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,950
If you're a friend of the Bazong,

649
00:35:58,950 --> 00:35:59,710
helping you

650
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,390
means helping the Bazong.

651
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,560
Thank you very much.

652
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,040
You're very welcome.

653
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,600
Magistrate.

654
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,280
Don't yell.

655
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,950
Let him look at the straw mat.

656
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,360
Is that Li Han?

657
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,360
I'll ask you again.

658
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,800
Where is Li Han?

659
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:49,000
You have no right to ask me.

660
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,950
The provincial governor's letter
doesn't work for you?

661
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,520
Do you have it?

662
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:54,430
I don't.

663
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,430
Then you're faking an official document.

664
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,670
You're faking... an official document...

665
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
If you don't tell the truth,

666
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,840
I'll kill you now.

667
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,710
I can not only judge

668
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,560
but also decide cases.

669
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,710
Maybe, in the end,

670
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,320
your case will fall into my hands.

671
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:21,950
I'll make sure you'll die for nothing.

672
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,520
Are you on earth

673
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,520
an official or a villain?

674
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,120
When I meet an official, I'm an official.

675
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,800
When I meet a villain,
I'll kill a villain.
