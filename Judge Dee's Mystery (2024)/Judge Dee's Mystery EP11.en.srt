00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,040
Tai, it's foggy again,

6
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,720
be careful.

7
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,640
OK.

8
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:53,960
Hurry up.

9
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,320
Tonight, you two

10
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,200
must follow me closely and protect me.

11
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

12
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,600
Where is the observation post?

13
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,320
It's up there.

14
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,040
Let's go.

15
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,720
Sentry.

16
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,040
Master.

17
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,920
Come on, buck up.

18
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,960
If something unexpected happens,

19
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,080
just blow the wooden whistle.

20
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,840
Yes, Master, don't worry.

21
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,160
Time for a meal.

22
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,200
Shh.

23
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,800
Where is the girl named Yusu

24
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,640
being held?

25
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:19,960
Say it.

26
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,520
In the aft cabin.

27
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,800
Deputy Secretary Hou.

28
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,960
Bring the girl named Yusu here

29
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,040
to replace Deputy Secretary Hou,

30
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,440
or I will kill him.

31
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,280
Get away.

32
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,640
Don't tell Commissioner Liu.

33
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,480
Sister.

34
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,040
What are you doing?

35
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,600
Sister.

36
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:05,960
Get up.

37
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:06,840
Go.

38
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,960
Where are you taking her?

39
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,800
Sister.

40
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,200
Let me go.

41
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:11,880
Yusu.

42
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,360
Go.

43
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:12,840
- Yusu.
- Sister.

44
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,280
- Yusu.
- Sister.

45
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,960
Who sent you here?

46
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,040
Was it someone from Heiyan?

47
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,720
Stop talking nonsense,

48
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,760
you'll find out soon.

49
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,880
Guanshi.

50
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,400
Don't come over.

51
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
Jin Sang?

52
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,160
They come from Heiyan,

53
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,880
and they brought us over here.

54
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,400
Shut up.

55
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,320
A ship is coming.

56
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,880
A ship is coming.

57
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,080
Chief, we received Jin Sang's signal.

58
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,720
Nock the arrow.

59
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,920
Nock the arrow.

60
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,280
Watch out.

61
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,440
It's an enemy ship.

62
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,520
Shoot the arrow.

63
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,720
Shoot.

64
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,640
Alert!

65
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,080
Everyone, take cover.

66
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,760
Hide quickly.

67
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,640
Don't be panic.

68
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,880
Don't run around.

69
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,600
Don't come over.

70
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,800
You're done.

71
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,640
You're done.

72
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,560
Go to defend the enemy

73
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,040
and command the Yulin Guards,

74
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,720
otherwise

75
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,280
we will all die here.

76
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,320
Go.

77
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:56,960
Come up.

78
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,640
Come here.

79
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,080
What's the sound outside?

80
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:03,800
Commissioner,

81
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,080
I don't know.

82
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,600
Go and guard the door.

83
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,760
Don't let anyone in.

84
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,040
Yes.

85
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,040
Don't run.

86
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:14,960
Magistrate.

87
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,200
Magistrate.

88
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,400
Don't be panic, everyone.

89
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,440
Archers.

90
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,240
Where are the archers?

91
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,400
Quick.

92
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:22,840
Magistrate.

93
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,320
Mr. Gu,

94
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,400
Heiyan is on the attack.

95
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,480
Let's go back to the cabin.

96
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,600
They're not Heiyan.

97
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,720
I've been set up.

98
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,960
Who did it?

99
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,280
Jin Sang?

100
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,320
Someone wants to kill Director Yi and me
and silence us.

101
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,840
We shouldn't have coveted

102
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,760
the benefits of smuggling gold.

103
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,400
Who are the buyers of gold?

104
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,800
Only Wang Lide knows.

105
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,520
I only provide the ships.

106
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,080
Magistrate.

107
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,880
Magistrate.

108
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,880
Magistrate.

109
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,760
The Yulin Guards,

110
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,040
assemble on the port side!

111
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,560
Nock the arrow.

112
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,520
Forty zhang.

113
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,400
Shoot.

114
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,670
Prepare to board

115
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,030
when we're nearly twenty zhang.

116
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,480
Prepare to board

117
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,840
when we're nearly twenty zhang.

118
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,680
Qiao Tai,

119
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,640
go find Ms. Cao.

120
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,240
Tell them

121
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,520
not to act rashly.

122
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,760
Don't move.

123
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,600
Let her come alone.

124
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,040
Let me go.

125
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,680
Go.

126
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,520
Stop.

127
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,160
- Go back.
- Go back.

128
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,680
Go back.

129
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,520
Come here.

130
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,640
Come here.

131
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,800
Now she is worth more than you.

132
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,160
Help me.

133
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,080
Help me.

134
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,400
Ms. Cao,

135
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,680
Ms. Cao.

136
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,680
Within ten zhang.

137
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,800
Magistrate,

138
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,040
there is no one in Ms. Cao's room.

139
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,680
Magistrate,

140
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,200
Jin Sang captured Yusu.

141
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,760
Hold the deck.

142
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,560
Chief, we've lost quite a few brothers.

143
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,440
Do we still proceed closer to the ship?

144
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,000
Continue as planned.

145
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,280
Yes.

146
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,320
Help me.

147
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,880
Help me.

148
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,800
Help me.

149
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,920
Tell me what on earth did he say to you?

150
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,360
Help me.

151
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,200
Nock the arrow.

152
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,320
Hou Yu.

153
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,800
Yusu.

154
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,960
Qiao.

155
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,800
He is from Heiyan.

156
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,280
Help me.

157
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,360
Magistrate Di.

158
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,800
Commissioner Liu.

159
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,200
What happened?

160
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,760
Jin Sang captured Yusu.

161
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,960
Magistrate Di went to negotiate.

162
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
Yusu.

163
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,400
The secret lies in Yusu.

164
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,480
That's why on the ship,

165
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
as soon as Yusu was taken into custody,

166
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,680
Di Renjie and his fellows became anxious

167
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,080
and sent Qiao Tai to visit.

168
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,760
If the situation is critical,

169
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,760
Di Renjie will definitely reveal his flaws

170
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,080
and then cover up Yusu.

171
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,600
Di Renjie.

172
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,200
Magistrate Di,

173
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,320
help me.

174
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,720
Help me.

175
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,960
If you remain silent,

176
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,080
I will surely kill you.

177
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,720
Magistrate Di,

178
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,600
help...

179
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,720
help me.

180
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,640
Say.

181
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:35,920
Say it.

182
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,120
Commissioner.

183
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,040
What do you want?

184
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:41,960
Gold.

185
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,040
I'm going to use it to seek justice for

186
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,560
my ten brothers who died.

187
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,080
Who killed them?

188
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,240
Wang Lide.

189
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,600
Where is he?

190
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,960
Wang Lide embezzled the gold
and ran away.

191
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,800
This is his woman,

192
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,280
the only clue to the gold.

193
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,880
Tell me,

194
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,720
where is Wang Lide?

195
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,920
I really don't know.

196
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,560
- You are so stupid.
- I really don't know.

197
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,520
She is just a songstress

198
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,080
and has nothing to do with gold.

199
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,760
If I weren't here now,

200
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,440
you would die immediately.

201
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,680
Let her go.

202
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,160
Who is stupid?

203
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,160
Look around this ship.

204
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,200
They're all from Heiyan.

205
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,440
In less than an hour,

206
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,760
Heiyan can kill everyone

207
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,920
on this ship.

208
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,600
There is no need to hide the truth now.

209
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,520
Heiyan originally wanted to rob the gold.

210
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,240
We have long heard about

211
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,920
Wang Lide smuggling gold from Baekje.

212
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,920
I told him

213
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,320
that when the next large shipment of gold
is escorted,

214
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,680
Heiyan will take over.

215
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,560
We'll rob the gold on the way

216
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,360
and give him one-tenth of it.

217
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,360
The two big shots at the port,

218
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,520
Gu Mengbin and Yi Pan,
were both involved.

219
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,160
They both got a share of the benefits.

220
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,080
According to our request,

221
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,080
Wang Lide replaced the crew members
with Heiyan's brothers,

222
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,720
and ten of them went to Baekje with him.

223
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,280
But that night,

224
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,840
we sent a ship
to pick up the gold as agreed.

225
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,000
Both gold and Wang Lide disappeared,

226
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,600
and our members were poisoned.

227
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,760
There were strong winds and waves
that night.

228
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,080
We've checked

229
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,520
that none of the merchant ships in Penglai
went to sea.

230
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,200
We concluded
that the news of the gold hijacking

231
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,480
must have been leaked.

232
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:25,840
So I pretended to

233
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,760
be a survivor

234
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,760
and intentionally diverted your attention

235
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,600
in order to find out the truth
through you.

236
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,200
The chart you got

237
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,600
was deliberately released by us.

238
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,560
After setting sail, I quietly
went on the deck and destroyed the mast,

239
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,840
leaving your ship alone.

240
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,600
We must take back the gold.

241
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,640
The person who knows the truth
is on this ship.

242
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,400
I really don't know.

243
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,600
Shoot arrows.

244
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,200
Stop.

245
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,120
Go.

246
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,040
Heiyan has boarded the ship.

247
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,440
Kill them.

248
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,560
Kill them.

249
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,560
Heiyan.

250
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,720
Go outside and take a walk.

251
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,640
Stuck in this cage,

252
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,640
you could only be a plaything in the end.

253
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,080
Chief,

254
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,840
I am here.

255
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,000
Di Renjie,

256
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,480
thank you for telling us
the secret of gold

257
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,000
and bringing us here.

258
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,400
Chief,

259
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,040
this woman has a clue to gold.

260
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,830
I... I don't know anything.

261
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,720
Jump down.

262
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,110
There's a boat waiting to pick us up.

263
00:18:59,280 --> 00:18:59,960
Let's go.

264
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:01,760
- Go
- Don't kill me.

265
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,920
- Go.
- Don't kill me.

266
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,830
Guanshi.

267
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,320
Don't let anyone go.

268
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,840
Chief.

269
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,120
Kill them all.

270
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,760
Retreat.

271
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,720
Magistrate.

272
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,880
Wang Lide

273
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:18,320
left three words that I didn't recognize.

274
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,200
Yusu.

275
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,120
Di Renjie

276
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,320
is colluding with the enemy.

277
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,720
Everyone, nock the arrows.

278
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,240
- Commissioner.
- Don't shoot arrows.

279
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:45,720
Hou Yu.

280
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,960
- Commissioner, don't shoot arrows.
- Magistrate.

281
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,160
Don't shoot arrows.

282
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,320
Shoot.

283
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,200
Di Renjie.

284
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,760
Magistrate.

285
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,160
Di Renjie.

286
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,280
Di Renjie.

287
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,840
Magistrate.

288
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,400
Magistrate.

289
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,400
If a lark wants to fly higher,

290
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,560
it must go farther.

291
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,960
Go outside and take a walk.

292
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,120
Stuck in this cage,

293
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,840
you could only be a plaything in the end.

294
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,920
Who are you going to see?

295
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,880
What?

296
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,800
Who do you want to see

297
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,000
after taking such a big risk
to get on the ship?

298
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,640
That person

299
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,800
is important, right?

300
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,080
Have you seen that person?

301
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,600
Yes.

302
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,640
What should we do next?

303
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,160
Hong should have received my signal.

304
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,040
Let's wait for him.

305
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,400
I notice that you're very skilled at

306
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,760
making fires and setting up camps.

307
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,240
You must have been to many places,
haven't you?

308
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,480
I went to the north of the Great Wall.

309
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,400
You are really well-informed.

310
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,960
I guess
you must've gained many life insights.

311
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,760
Insights on life.

312
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,840
Insights on life

313
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,840
cannot be gained until the end of life.

314
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,960
When that time comes,

315
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,800
speaking of the past,

316
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,600
I might feel that

317
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,720
everything was just a fleeting moment.

318
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,440
Yes.

319
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,640
Everything was just a fleeting moment.

320
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,880
Someone once told me

321
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,280
that a lark stuck in a cage

322
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,000
could only be a plaything

323
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,160
in the end.

324
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,720
Only by traveling

325
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,480
can one understand the rule of nature.

326
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,200
At that time,

327
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,280
I was young and naive,

328
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,400
believing that this was the essence
of the world.

329
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,920
Now looking back,

330
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,440
it's nothing but an empty illusion.

331
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,120
Not exactly.

332
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,040
The journey of life

333
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,040
is unpredictable.

334
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,400
One may come across

335
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,800
a variety of experiences.

336
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,840
Every challenge you've encountered

337
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,000
might offer you some inspiration,

338
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,000
sadness,

339
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,360
or joy.

340
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,040
I'm going to collect some firewood.

341
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,740

348
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,400
When I was passing by,

349
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,320
I heard you play a Bingzhou ditty.

350
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,960
I wonder

351
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,960
if you could play it again for me.

352
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:59,780
♪Fate brings us together and apart,
yet my heart remains undisturbed♪

353
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,520
One's missing.

354
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,720
Maybe someone escaped with it.

355
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,600
Do you recognize him?

356
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,200
I do. It's him.

357
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,240
Wang Lide.

358
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,760
Magistrate.

359
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,320
It's Wang Lide.

360
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,120
Magistrate,

361
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,280
look.

362
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:57,640
Huaiying,

363
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,040
according to the letter you gave me,

364
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,080
I found the island.

365
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,600
This is the Huang Dao Yi
you asked me to find.

366
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,640
Fortunately, a few years ago,
there was a magistrate

367
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,840
who liked to observe the stars at night.

368
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,320
So I found one in the library.

369
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,840
It's all rusted now,

370
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,680
I hurriedly asked a craftsman
to repair it.

371
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,040
I wonder if it can still be used?

372
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,680
It's OK.

373
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,240
Where are the calendar books?

374
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,720
They're all here.

375
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,240
All the old almanacs that

376
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,840
can be found are here.

377
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,360
Wang Lide left three words

378
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,960
that I didn't recognize.

379
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,480
This is what Yusu left for me
before she died.

380
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,840
It is the words on the score.

381
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,200
Yusu said
that Wang Lide played the guqin.

382
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,400
Wang Lide was a gold smuggler.

383
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,520
He must have had contacts
with people in the capital.

384
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,520
Then he learned

385
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,400
this popular score in the capital.

386
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,920
The words on the score

387
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,040
not only suggest the fingering

388
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,840
[fourteen]
but also imply two numbers
(ten and four).

389
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,120
The "ten" represents the Hui
of the guqin.

390
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,680
A guqin has 13 Huis.

391
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,560
A star leading board
consists of 12 square boards.

392
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,240
These 13 Huis

393
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,520
are enough to include
the star leading board.

394
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,200
The "ten" represents...

395
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,600
The tenth board
of the star leading board.

396
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,120
Yes.

397
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,280
It's called the ten zhi.

398
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,240
What about this "four"?

399
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,880
The "four" represents the string.

400
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,240
A guqin has seven strings.

401
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,440
This season,

402
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,440
if the sailors are to set sail,

403
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,640
they'll need to observe
six or seven constellations.

404
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,800
Counting from left to right,

405
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,320
the fourth is

406
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,680
Zhinv Star.

407
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,720
This means

408
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,360
that we need to align
the tenth star leading board

409
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,440
with Zhinv Star in the sky, right?

410
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,560
As long as we measure three stars

411
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,120
and compare them with the chart,

412
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,320
we can deduce the location

413
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,400
where Wang Lide left the gold.

414
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,160
What about the other two words
left by Yusu?

415
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,640
She didn't have a chance to say it.

416
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,000
Then how can we measure the stars?

417
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,360
Wang Lide seems to be an uneducated guy,

418
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,000
but he must have studied
the tides in Penglai

419
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,160
or

420
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,640
the people behind him have studied.

421
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,840
That person

422
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,560
is the killer.

423
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,720
As for the Maritime Trade Administration,
I went there to check.

424
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,520
The soldiers who sailed
with Director Yi that night said

425
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,880
that Director Yi's order
was for night patrol.

426
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,800
But there was a mysterious guy
on the ship,

427
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,600
who was said to be a guest of Director Yi.

428
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,680
This man covered his face
since he got on the ship.

429
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,400
The soldiers couldn't see
his face clearly,

430
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,840
so they called him the mysterious guy.

431
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,000
I've got it figured out.

432
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,800
I've got it all figured out.

433
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,320
That night,

434
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,960
Director Yi took him on a voyage with him.

435
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,080
There are three copies of the route map,

436
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,120
one for Wang Lide

437
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,040
and one for Heiyan.

438
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,920
The third copy is

439
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,920
in the hands of this mysterious man.

440
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,560
I checked the weather that night.

441
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,440
The sky was clear
in the first half of the night,

442
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,760
but it was windy and rainy
in the second half of the night.

443
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,000
Therefore, the ship must have arrived

444
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,400
at the designated sea area

445
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,960
before the middle of the night.

446
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,880
But neither Director Yi nor the soldiers

447
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,320
had seen gold.

448
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,200
Therefore,

449
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,040
the mysterious man

450
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,560
must have boarded Wang Lide's boat alone

451
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,080
and killed him.

452
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,160
And the mysterious man

453
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,920
finally threw the boxes filled with gold

454
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,200
to the sea.

455
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,200
Threw gold to the sea?

456
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,520
I think I'm right.

457
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,880
But this man has spent so much effort.

458
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,080
Why did he sink the gold
to the bottom of the sea?

459
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,240
What's wrong with the man?

460
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,600
He can't stand gold,

461
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,920
and he has a grudge against gold?

462
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,800
There is no such person.

463
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,680
Of course, he wanted
to keep the gold for himself.

464
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,040
He couldn't get rid of greed

465
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,640
even though he tried his best.

466
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,000
The place where gold was sunk that night

467
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,400
was actually not far from the coast.

468
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,640
[Record of Haitao]
"Record of Haitao" records

469
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,320
that a strange large tide occurs here

470
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,320
every hundred years.

471
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,160
When a tide occurs,

472
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,880
the water level at low tide

473
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,200
can retreat more than ten lis

474
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,600
to reveal a large trench.

475
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,160
The cycle of hundreds of years has passed,

476
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,680
and the great tide

477
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,880
is happening today.

478
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,600
Guanshi.

479
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,200
Huaiying.
