00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,940
[Mrs. Lang]

193
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,690
I'll kill him.

194
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,570
I'll kill him.

195
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,570
I'll kill him.

196
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,330
Greed, anger, ignorance,
dislike, love, desire, hatred.

197
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:48,380
Ignorance.

198
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,690
The saying came true.

199
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,980
Kill him.

200
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,570
Follow her.

201
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,820
Dead.

202
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,820
They are all dead.

203
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,130
Dead.

204
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,860
They are all dead.

205
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:23,980
They are all dead.

206
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,210
It's mine.

207
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,130
It's mine.

208
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:28,860
Nothing.

209
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,500
Nothing inside.

210
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,420
Liars!

211
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,530
Liars!

212
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,060
Liars!

213
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,500
All of them.

214
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,450
Liars!

215
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,570
If Chu Lei

216
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,860
was really as bloodthirsty

217
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:33,890
as Lin Fan said,

218
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,260
it would be very difficult to catch him.

219
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,210
So,

220
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,130
Lin Fan was lying?

221
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,260
Why did he lie?

222
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,180
Lin Fan.

223
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,180
Lin Fan.

224
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:58,890
Lin Fan.

225
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,530
You...

226
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:06,740
She is in the room.

227
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,650
She is in the room.

228
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,180
She is in the room.

229
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,300
You have met Heiyan,

230
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,980
but you never told me about it.

231
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,690
He taught you

232
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,500
that Bingzhou ditty?

233
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,060
He just taught me how to sing it,
nothing more.

234
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,090
Besides, I saw with my own eyes

235
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,420
he got shot and fell into the sea.

236
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,690
I thought he died long ago.

237
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:04,260
So,

238
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,570
I didn't mention it.

239
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,650
What about Lin Fan?

240
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,450
You were suspicious of him.

241
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,330
Why didn't you tell me?

242
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,450
Now it seems

243
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,300
I really misunderstood him.

244
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,570
It doesn't matter

245
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,300
if I told you or not.

246
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,260
You should have told me.

247
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,090
That way,

248
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,450
you wouldn't get in trouble

249
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,210
in the mason's shop.

250
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:34,860
Magistrate.

251
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,980
Lin Fan has woken up.

252
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,060
Nothing serious now.

253
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,060
Have a good rest.

254
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,260
Thank you.

255
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:05,890
Magistrate,

256
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,860
I've already changed his dressing.

257
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,450
Thank you.

258
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,530
How are you feeling?

259
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,010
Before last night,

260
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,300
I was almost convinced

261
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,010
you were the murderer.

262
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,500
Chu Lei is still alive.

263
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,260
He is Heiyan.

264
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,380
Where is he?

265
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,450
He stabbed you with a knife.

266
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,410
Do you still want to cover for him?

267
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,570
We were comrade-in-arms.

268
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,020
We were as intimate as brothers.

269
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,780
You said that to me.

270
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,900
Now you want me

271
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,260
to betray him.

272
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,660
I am asking you to uphold justice.

273
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,290
How is this betrayal?

274
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,020
What is justice?

275
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,930
Not to kill the innocents?

276
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,290
Who are the innocents?

277
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,380
When the nest is overturned
in a rainstorm,

278
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,170
no egg stays unbroken.

279
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,980
Chu Lei taught you this?

280
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,740
Magistrate,

281
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,900
it's not that I don't want
to tell you his whereabouts.

282
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,690
I truly don't know.

283
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,500
You are in my Magistrate's Office.

284
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,170
No one

285
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,740
is able to hurt you.

286
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,980
You don't have to worry about anything.

287
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,620
Magistrate Di,

288
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,810
since you found me,

289
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,260
I have been a dying man.

290
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,540
My life

291
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,450
is in your hands

292
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,860
as well as his.

293
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,500
What can I worry about?

294
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,570
Magistrate, I checked it.

295
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,740
There is no sign of a break-in.

296
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,690
Nor is there any sign of struggle.

297
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,450
None of these sharp objects

298
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,540
match

299
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,170
the cut.

300
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,660
Looks like the murderer

301
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,170
has taken the murder weapon away.

302
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,860
When Lin Fan was in a coma,

303
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,210
we checked his body.

304
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,020
There is no mark of Heiyan.

305
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,260
If he is from Heiyan,

306
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,090
there must be a mark.

307
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:22,900
It seems

308
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,380
I really thought too much.

309
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,090
Lin Fan

310
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,540
is just an outsider.

311
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,660
Why

312
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,570
are you keeping me here?

313
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,020
All the villagers in Tongkang Village
died an unnatural death.

314
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,090
Only you survived.

315
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,930
Before the truth is discovered,

316
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,140
you can only stay here.

317
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:31,740
Where is my son?

318
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,020
Is he dead?

319
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,900
Yes.

320
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,570
He is dead?

321
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,380
He is dead?

322
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:57,540
Mrs. Lang,

323
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,780
my condolences.

324
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,980
I need you

325
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,690
to tell me

326
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,860
what truly happened

327
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,450
in Tongkang Village.

328
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,740
What really happened

329
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,980
in Tongkang Village?

330
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,690
It was all because

331
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,740
someone posted

332
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,690
a notice on the well of the village

333
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,090
three days ago.

334
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,740
[The well has been poisoned]

335
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,980
It said

336
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,450
the well

337
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:40,570
had been poisoned.

338
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:41,570
Who posted this?

339
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,290
Their mouths will rot

340
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,410
- and they will die a horrible death.
- Who posted it?

341
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:46,860
I saw it in the morning.

342
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,930
There are people

343
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,050
drinking from this well every day.

344
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,620
If it was really poisoned,

345
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,380
no one in our village would survive.

346
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,740
Nonsense.

347
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,090
Help me with my bucket.

348
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:56,860
What's wrong?

349
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,780
Stomachache.

350
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,540
It's no use to go to the bathroom.

351
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,900
You need to detoxify.

352
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:02,740
Go.

353
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,380
Let's go.

354
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,980
In the beginning,

355
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,020
no one believed it.

356
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:12,930
They all thought

357
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,900
someone was teasing them.

358
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,020
What happened next?

359
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,450
Someone died.

360
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:24,930
On the second day...

361
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,020
It's drinkable.

362
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,810
Someone

363
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,570
died of poisoning.

364
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,140
What's the matter?

365
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,050
What's the matter with him?

366
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:34,410
What's the matter?

367
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,740
Everyone, come and look.

368
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:37,620
What's the matter?

369
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:38,780
Wake up.

370
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,210
He...

371
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,450
He's poisoned.

372
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:42,570
Poisoned?

373
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,260
This water is really poisonous.

374
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,810
Wake up.

375
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:48,860
Later,

376
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,780
someone found a new notice.

377
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,050
The notice said

378
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:59,500
there was a crock
on a stump in the village.

379
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:03,570
In it was the clue to the antidote.

380
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:05,930
Antidote?

381
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:09,210
[Notice]
The clue to the antidote is in the crock.

382
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,780
Two days later,

383
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,090
if the population
of the village is halved,

384
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:12,900
everyone can be saved.

385
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,860
If more than half the people are left,

386
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,210
there will be no way to detoxify.

387
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,810
What should we do?

388
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,810
What are you doing?

389
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:22,740
Fatty, what are you doing?

390
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,740
I can't wait.

391
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,690
I want to get the antidote.

392
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,690
The antidote

393
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:28,930
could only save

394
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,780
half the people in the village.

395
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,690
What could we do?

396
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,930
What could we do?

397
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,740
His intention

398
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,740
was to let you kill each other.

399
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:50,020
On the morning of the third day,

400
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:54,540
some people were trying to get the crock.

401
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:02,090
Each with their own axe to grind.
They turned into strangers.

402
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,210
Everyone wanted to know

403
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,020
what was inside the crock before others.

404
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,500
Later on, at night,

405
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,330
someone ventured to take down the crock

406
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,930
secretly to save his life.

407
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,780
He didn't expect

408
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,860
some people had been lurking around there
for a long time.

409
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,620
They were biding their time.

410
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,330
What are you doing?

411
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,380
More and more people were coming
at the news.

412
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,620
The three-day period would soon be over.

413
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:40,020
No one wanted to be one of the dying half.

414
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,570
There was suspicion,

415
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,740
stalemate, and confrontation.

416
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:47,660
The desire for life

417
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,740
finally turned everyone

418
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,660
into a demon.

419
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,450
No more examinations are needed.

420
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,740
If they were really poisoned,

421
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,900
how could they have the energy

422
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,020
to fight and kill each other?

423
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,050
Magistrate,

424
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:07,170
the body of the first poisoned man
was found.

425
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,570
Over there.

426
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:36,980
Huaiying.

427
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,860
The body has developed herpes.

428
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,410
His fingers are black.

429
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,930
This is the symptom of arsenic poisoning.

430
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,090
He was poisoned by his wife

431
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,020
through arsenic wrapped in a Bing.

432
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:09,450
They just blamed it

433
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,930
on the water in the well.

434
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,450
The water in the well

435
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,260
was not poisoned at all.

436
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:19,380
Could everything be done by his wife?

437
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:22,900
An ordinary village woman

438
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,260
couldn't cause such a commotion.

439
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,450
A crock,

440
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,290
a notice,

441
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,620
and a rumor

442
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,570
caused the death

443
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,290
of nearly all villagers.

444
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,170
Absurd.

445
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,690
Now

446
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,450
do you still think

447
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,690
it was just Chu Lei's revenge?

448
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,540
The tragedy of the whole Tongkang Village

449
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,050
validates "Ignorance".

450
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,450
The ignorance

451
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,330
of all the people in the village.

452
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:58,570
Chu Lei is Heiyan.

453
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:02,570
He has gone far

454
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,540
beyond revenge murder.

455
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,740
He wants chaos

456
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,690
in the world.

457
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,410
Mrs. Lang,

458
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,090
have you heard

459
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,810
of Chunyun?

460
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,500
The daughter

461
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,380
of the shopkeeper

462
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,930
of Xiao's Dyeing House.

463
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,740
She once married my son.

464
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,140
Then she suddenly disappeared.

465
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,170
So we let my son divorce her.

466
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,210
Have you heard

467
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,290
of Chu Lei?

468
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,210
If I tell you

469
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,380
what happened in Tongkang Village

470
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,020
was because someone wanted
to take revenge on your Lang family,

471
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,140
do you believe it?

472
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:02,660
What?

473
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,380
Say it again.

474
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,690
Why?

475
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,540
Why?

476
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,740
Why?

477
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,930
Who wanted to take revenge on us?

478
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:32,170
Who wanted to take revenge on us?

479
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,660
Why?

480
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,740
Release Mrs. Lang.

481
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,020
Tell me!

482
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,170
Find a room for her

483
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,260
in the Magistrate's Office.

484
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:44,170
Yes.

485
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:48,290
Tell me who it is.

486
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,690
My son...

487
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,540
This is from Miss Qiuyue

488
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,930
across the street.

489
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,170
Have a taste.

490
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:11,900
Thank you, Magistrate.

491
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,620
It's not tasty?

492
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,690
Yes, it's tasty.

493
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,290
Aren't you curious

494
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,620
how the investigation
of the case is going on?

495
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,090
If you have found any clue,

496
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,980
you would tell me.

497
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,170
Almost everyone in Tongkang Village

498
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,380
was slaughtered.

499
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,540
There is only one survivor.

500
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,500
He still did it.

501
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,380
Just because Chunyu

502
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,050
married into the Lang family.

503
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,980
We are both sure

504
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,620
he didn't do it

505
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,740
just for personal revenge.

506
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,860
Do you know

507
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,740
where other members of Heiyan

508
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,260
are hiding?

509
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,930
In fact, Heiyan has no other members.

510
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,170
Heiyan

511
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,140
is Chu Lei alone.

512
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,540
Sure enough.

513
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,450
Previously, Heiyan

514
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,410
had just a few members.

515
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:37,540
But every member was very brilliant

516
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,810
and ruthless.

517
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,170
The gangs in Jianghu

518
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,660
were willing to submit to him

519
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:44,090
and be ordered by him.

520
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,540
In recent years, Chu Lei
dismissed his subordinates.

521
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,620
Some retreated into seclusion,

522
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,900
and some became leaders of the gangs.

523
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,210
Heiyan

524
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,290
seems insignificant.

525
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,570
In fact,

526
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,170
Chu Lei alone

527
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,330
is in control

528
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,090
of all the bandits in Lanfang County

529
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,740
and asks them to do evil.

530
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,740
Occasionally,

531
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,740
he also suppresses them.

532
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:10,540
What does he get

533
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,090
out of it?

534
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,980
He wants nothing from it.

535
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,410
He isn't doing it for personal gain.

536
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,810
He just wants Lanfang County

537
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,930
to be what he wants it to be.

538
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,090
Go on eating.

539
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,500
I want to meet him.

540
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,620
He will show up if he wants to.

541
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:47,050
If he hides away,

542
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,980
there is nothing I can do.

543
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,170
What you said to me today

544
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:56,900
has put you in danger.

545
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,570
I won't let you down.

546
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:08,170
Thank you.

547
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,930
From tomorrow on,

548
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,410
your task

549
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,930
is to protect Lin Fan.

550
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,570
Don't let anything happen to him.

551
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:28,780
[Lanfang County Magistrate's Office]

552
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:31,450
Mr. Qiao.

553
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,340
What a coincidence!

554
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,300
Thank you for your hard work.

555
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:41,580
I know

556
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,450
the Magistrate asked you to protect me
day and night

557
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,850
to ensure my safety.

558
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:47,020
Chu Lei and I were comrade-in-arms.

559
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,210
You don't have to worry.

560
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:52,780
What's going on?

561
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:54,610
People from the government are coming.

562
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:56,170
Let's go.

563
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:58,370
Let's take a look.

564
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,020
[Notice]

565
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,260
Really running wild.

566
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:08,300
Notice.

567
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,580
Starting from today,

568
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,890
Heiyan will recruit new members
in five days.

569
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:14,500
Five days later,

570
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,370
those who are not members of Heiyan

571
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:17,690
will be killed.

572
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:25,690
Greed, anger, ignorance,
dislike, love, desire, hatred.

573
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,820
Clinging to life

574
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,580
is also a form of greed.

575
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,650
The streets aren't safe these days.

576
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:37,930
Don't come out alone at night.

577
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,130
What's there to be afraid of?

578
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:41,060
Don't make me worry about you.

579
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,210
Someone really doesn't mind the cold.

580
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:47,340
Wait.

581
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,410
What's up?

582
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,060
Why are you dressed like this?

583
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,690
I feel very hot.

584
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,100
You feel hot?

585
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,210
You say you feel hot in such a weather?

586
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,300
Miss,

587
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,540
who said

588
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,780
I couldn't dress like this at night?

589
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,690
Do you think I can't deal with you?

590
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,060
- I'm telling you...
- Let's go.

591
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:08,780
Let's go.

592
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,500
Stay out of my sight.

593
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,060
Alright.

594
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:13,850
How is it?

595
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,100
They are really running wild.

596
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,500
I think

597
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,300
we should capture all the people

598
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,060
with the Heiyan tattoo.

599
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,300
I'll see who dares to get that tattoo.

600
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,850
What's your reason for capturing them?

601
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:27,260
They didn't violate the law.

602
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:28,690
Even if you want to capture them now,

603
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,300
don't you think it's already too late?

604
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:34,500
I can't just let them do it.

605
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,450
What kind of thing is this?

606
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,660
[Magistrate's Office]

607
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,930
I'll let him watch me

608
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,650
take control

609
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,100
of Lanfang County again.

610
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:01,610
I have to somehow punish him.
