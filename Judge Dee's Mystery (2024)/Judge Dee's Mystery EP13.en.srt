Since you are so obsessed with the body,

7
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,560
you can take it away.

8
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,520
But I have to remind you

This morning.

If you intended to cremate it,

They even lost their knives.

29

They had erotic pictures
hidden in their chests.

they were still smiling.

00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,280
what you saw.

174
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,280
Yes.

175
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,760
Magistrate.

176
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,040
That night,

177
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,160
it was raining heavily.

178
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,200
All the shops nearby were closed.

179
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,440
I was sitting outside the teahouse,

180
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,920
waiting for the shopkeeper
to come back and close up.

181
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,280
At this time,

182
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,200
[Zhong Fang]
Mr. Zhong walked out of the shop

183
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,600
in his normal clothes

184
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,080
and headed to the north.

185
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,040
Suddenly,

186
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,880
a gust of wind blew,

187
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,840
knocking down the umbrellas
outside the teahouse.

188
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,520
When I looked at him again,

189
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,000
his outfit

190
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,760
seemed to have changed

191
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,440
into

192
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,400
a birdman.

193
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,800
Yes, a birdman.

194
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,240
Turned into a birdman.

195
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,160
In the rain,

196
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,120
he flew away like that.

197
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,840
Magistrate.

198
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,720
If you don't believe

199
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,840
what I saw,

200
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,560
just ask around.

201
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,000
Magistrate.

202
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,840
Thank you.

203
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,720
Please.

204
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,680
Magistrate, this way.

205
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,760
This was found on Mr. Zhong.

206
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,320
Non-performing pawn again.

207
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,720
Magistrate, please take a look.

208
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,760
On this,

209
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,560
[A self-defense dagger]
no record of people, value, and property.

210
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,880
None.

211
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,720
This is the pawn Zhong Fang accepted.

212
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,720
Loss-making business.

213
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,120
How's Mr. Zhong
having zero business acumen

214
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,760
while Zhong's Pawn Shop

215
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,880
can achieve such a scale?

216
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,360
No.

217
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,920
Mr. Zhong did have business acumen.

218
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,040
And

219
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,280
he was very self-driven.

220
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,280
Twenty years ago,

221
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,880
when Zhong's Pawn Shop

222
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,480
just opened, he said

223
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,440
that he would make it

224
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,160
the largest pawn store in Penglai.

225
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,200
Pity.

226
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,040
We were almost there.

227
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,680
He changed later.

228
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,920
Over the past six months,

229
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,960
Mr. Zhong often seemed absent-minded,

230
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,840
spending less time in the shop

231
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,800
and neglecting business matters.

232
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,400
He even disappeared.

233
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,280
Every night,

234
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
he'd go out.

235
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,040
The next day,

236
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,120
he appeared.

237
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,120
Master.

238
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,240
You're finally back.

239
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,800
Go back and rest.

240
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,600
Especially the night before yesterday,

241
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,240
after he went out at night,

242
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,840
he didn't return the entire night.

243
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,640
At that time, I had a bad feeling.

244
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,640
Is there any regularity

245
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,600
about his disappearance?

246
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,720
Take me to his room and have a look.

247
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,360
Magistrate, please.

248
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,960
This is our master's room.

249
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,600
This is

250
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,040
a little messy.

251
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,760
It happened suddenly.

252
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,480
Without authority's permission,

253
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,320
I don't really

254
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,040
dare to let our men clean it.

255
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,520
About Mr. Zhong's personality,

256
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,560
he is introverted.

257
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:39,800
Magistrate.

258
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,560
Let me open the window,
so you can have some fresh air.

259
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,520
Shopkeeper Lin.

260
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,520
I will see for myself.

261
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,680
Magistrate, please help yourself.

262
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,640
Please help yourself.

263
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,000
Are all these painted by Mr. Zhong?

264
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:25,880
Yes.

265
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,560
I saw

266
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,600
it was him.

267
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,960
Magistrate, please help yourself.

268
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,480
Six months ago, Mr. Zhong

269
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,080
watched a shadow play
by a puppet troupe in the city.

270
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,800
After he came back,

271
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,480
he was too preoccupied
to feel an appetite

272
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,640
and spent all day painting these things.

273
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,320
Can I take this painting

274
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,880
back to the Magistrate's Office?

275
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,000
Of course you can.

276
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,320
Magistrate, please help yourself.

277
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:55,660
[Zhong's]

278
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,000
One last thing.

279
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,520
Magistrate, anything.

280
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,880
Has Mr. Zhong ever mentioned
Ying'er to you?

281
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,440
No, never.

282
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,280
Goodbye.

283
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,200
Magistrate, take care.

284
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,320
Move these big things

285
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,080
to the north room.

286
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,000
Arrange them properly.

287
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,800
Yes, sir.

288
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,840
Count them quickly.

289
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,600
I'm back.

290
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,960
Magistrate, you're back.

291
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,320
This

292
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,120
is listed by Hong.

293
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,640
Take a look
and see if anything is missing.

294
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,600
The rest of the properties
have already been prepared

295
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,480
and sent to the pawn shop.

296
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,000
What's the rush?

297
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,160
The directive says
to report for duty immediately.

298
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,360
You have to prepare early.

299
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,560
All right.

300
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,520
Hong, you make the arrangements.

301
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,040
Huaiying.

302
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,520
Haven't you

303
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,240
told Miss Cao about us leaving?

304
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,880
When are you planning to do it?

305
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,720
I know.

306
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,800
You are afraid
if you tell her about us leaving,

307
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,000
she won't go with us, right?

308
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,640
I will tell her.

309
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,680
I will.

310
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,120
Magistrate, you're back.

311
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,680
Hong.

312
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,480
If I seriously consider leaving,

313
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,360
it is not easy inside.

314
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,440
What is not easy?

315
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,720
Penglai...

316
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,920
I have had enough.

317
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,360
Especially the weather,

318
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,360
it rains and rains and rains.

319
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,520
I almost forget what the sun looks like.

320
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,440
When we arrive at Lanfang County
in the desert,

321
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,040
we're going to have a tough time
with all the wind and sun.

322
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,960
That will not make it easier.

323
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,040
Better than this humid weather.

324
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,800
Days after days,

325
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,280
I can't get my clothes dry.

326
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,320
Since we are definitely
going to Lanfang,

327
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,320
and we are still now in Penglai,

328
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,000
do well what is at hand.

329
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,680
Don't always be restless.

330
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,800
Particularly you.

331
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,120
Quickly count this.

332
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,280
Particularly you.

333
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,840
Mind your own business.

334
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,180
[Pawn ticket]

335
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,160
This feather...

336
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,560
This beak...

337
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,120
And these clothes.

338
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,720
Exactly Rain Master.

339
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,120
That means

340
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,400
Huang Ying'er lives in the watchtower.

341
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,800
And the body of Mr. Zhong

342
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,960
was also found in the watchtower.

343
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,680
All of this

344
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,840
can't just be a coincidence, can it?

345
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,080
Magistrate.

346

to deliver this improved straw rain cape.

After all we've been through,

519
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,960
you still can't kick
the habit of stealing.

520
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,520
A leopard can't change its spots, indeed.

521
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,560
Magistrate!

522
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,000
Magistrate.

523
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,200
Magistrate, I'll give her
a piece of my mind.

524
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,360
Don't be angry, Magistrate.

525
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,320
Come in quickly.

526
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:02,960
Take shelter from the rain,

527
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,840
you fool!

528
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,440
Are you stupid?

529
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,880
Leave me alone!

530
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,040
Just swallow your pride a little.
It won't hurt you!

531
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:32,880
You see,

532
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,760
it seems to have grown.

533
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,720
But it will take a few more years

534
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,480
before it blooms and bears fruit.

535
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,360
All in good time.

536
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,520
Miss Cao.

537
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,800
The straw rain cape is very good.

538
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,920
I like it very much.

539
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,280
Glad you like it.

540
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,520
Six months ago, Mr. Zhong

541
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,800
watched a shadow play
by a puppet troupe in the city.

542
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,520
After he came back,

543
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,080
he was too preoccupied
to feel an appetite...

544
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:16,720
Like this,

545
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,920
Mr. Zhong

546
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,640
was always moved

547
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,320
by these scammers' love stories.

548
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,120
After the performance,

549
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,480
she kept asking the members of the troupe

550
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,160
how Rain Master could come back to life.

551
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,480
Seemed that she couldn't
distinguish between the play and reality.

552
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,560
As if in this world,

553
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,240
there truly was a Rain Master.

554
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,200
Magistrate.

555
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,120
It's raining.

556
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,400
Magistrate.

557
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,120
It's raining heavily.

558
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,080
She's still out there in the rain.

559
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,320
She knows she was wrong.

560
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,600
Come in.

561
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:18,220
[Xiang's Fabric Shop]

562
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,480
Looks a bit like Rain Master.

563
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,480
I got it!

564
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,520
Whoever puts on Rain Master's clothes

565
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,800
becomes Rain Master!

566
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,920
Why haven't you come for so many days?

567
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,080
Do you know I've been waiting
for you every day?

568
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,600
Do you know how much I miss you?

569
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,200
How come you're so quiet?

570
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,320
What's wrong?

571
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,040
Why aren't you speaking?

572
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,160
You are not him.

573
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,840
There is no Rain Master in this world.

574
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,320
Who are you?

575
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:27,920
His last name is Zhong.

576
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,720
He's called Zhong Fang.

577
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,440
He likes you.

578
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,880
That's why he pretends
to be Rain Master

579
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,360
to get close to you.

580
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,600
Tell me.

581
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,400
What really happened that night?

582
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,520
Tell me.

583
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,320
Don't come any closer.

584
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,080
Put the knife down.

585
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,640
Do you remember seeing
those soldiers being punished

586
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,480
when you entered the barracks?

587
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:31,840
The Eighth Battalion.

588
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,520
They were supposed to patrol last night,

589
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,120
but these guys deserted.

590
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,920
God knows where they went.

591
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,600
They even lost their knives.

592
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,200
They must've

593
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,800
visited brothels last night.

594
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,800
They deserted
but were caught on the scene.

595
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
They had erotic pictures
hidden in their chests.

596
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,560
What do you want?

597
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,200
After being whipped,
they were still smiling.

598
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,000
Saying

599
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,920
last night was so worth it.

600
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,000
Stop it!

601
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,480
What are you doing?

602
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,190
It was me.

603
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,270
It was me.

604
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,800
I killed him!

605
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,400
It was me.

606
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,160
I killed him!

607
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:49,880
Who is there?

608
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,040
Stop!

609
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,280
[Wang Sanlang]
Did you kill the person?

610
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,400
Does this have anything to do
with the woman in the watchtower?

611
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,360
How about those child soldiers?

612
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,320
Were they present?

613
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,480
How did you kill him?

614
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,360
Magistrate.

615
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:14,840
He confessed.

616
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,160
Magistrate?

617
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,080
Magistrate?

618
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:31,920
Magistrate?

619
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,800
He has already confessed.

620
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,320
We can wrap it up now.

621
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,080
He confessed?

622
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,920
He didn't confess to anything.

623
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,440
Isn't it obvious
that he's the one who did it?

624
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,880
His fatal wound was in the back.

625
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,960
The stab in the chest

626
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,760
was completely different

627
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,560
from the one in the back

628
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,840
in terms of force and angle.

629
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,200
But every stab he made just now

630
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,720
had the same force.
