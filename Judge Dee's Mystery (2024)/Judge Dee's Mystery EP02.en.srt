177
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,080
Let's have a chat.

Come...

180

You...

181
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,440
I'm telling you.

182
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:44,710
You...

183
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,030
- Don't do anything reckless.
- You know Mr. Wei, right?

184

This key

191
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,350
is from the palace.

192
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,790
What a beautiful...

lady.

This is the third batch.

195
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,640
If the Jinwu Guards are in such a hurry,

196
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,200
something big must've happened
in the palace.

197
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,520
In the palace?

198
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,760
What could happen in the palace?

199
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,400
If we find out who owns this thing,

200
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,440
we should know it.

201
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,880
How can we do that?

202
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,520
Judging from the gilt threads

203
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,470
and the vermilion coloring,

204
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,350
ordinary people can't afford it.

205
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,760
The East Market

206
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,030
has a fragrance shop, Jingyuan Pavilion.

207
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,880
The best fragrances from Hu merchants

208
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,590
are always supplied there first.

209
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,150
Go and find out

210
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,590

211
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,470
these fragrances.

212
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,960

Did someone lock the door

218
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,880
from the outside?

219
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,760
There's a hidden door, right?

220
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,110
Where does it lead?

221
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,350
You must be mistaken, sir.

222
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,910
There's no such a door.

The other bodies
were all burned to death.

Only this one

was found in another room.

a palace maid hiding
in Jushui Entertainment House?

237

I've checked it out.

238
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,350
The sachet contains a mixture of myrrh,

240
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,710
All of them are the Empress's
favorite fragrance.

241
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,440
Could it be that the lady
was from the Empress's palace?

242
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,030
There's surely
something secretive about her.

That's why

00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:18,340
[Wei's Residence]

349
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,000
Huaiying,

350
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,590
as expected from someone
who has been to Western Regions.

351
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,760
You're so knowledgeable.

352
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,000
I envy you.

353
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,110
Unlike me.

354
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,310
Every day,

355
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,920
I'm stuck in the Imperial Academy,

356
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,710
looking miserable and gloomy
all day long.

357
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,590
I've been copying documents

358
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,920
and writing articles endlessly.

359
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,430
These years,

360
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,230
if it weren't for Mr. Wei's care,

361
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,310
I'd hardly be able to make a living.

362
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,640
Stop drinking.

363
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,400
Drinking can easily lead to a mistake.

364
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,830
I've never made a mistake
because of drinking.

365
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,950
Someone spiked my drink

366
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,950
that day.

367
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:09,470
What's this?

368
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,350
It's all fate.

369
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,280
People are now living in fear.

370
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,310
They're all saying it's Heaven's wrath.

371
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,230
What ''Heaven's wrath''?

372
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:18,800
Tell me.

373
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,880
The Empress's favorite Wutong tree

374
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,710
was struck by a thunderbolt.

375
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,350
The entertainment house she liked

376
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,950
was also struck by a thunderbolt
and caught fire.

377
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,190
What else could this be
if not a warning from Heaven?

378
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,110
Jushui Entertainment House

379
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,800
didn't catch fire because it was struck

380
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,880
by a thunderbolt.

381
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,470
You didn't tell me anything,

382
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,760
so I must go outside

383
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,160
to listen to these rumors.

384
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,760
It's not Heaven's wrath.

385
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,590
You're just like the Master,

386
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,520
a miser with words.

387
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,230
Mr. Wei.

388
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,680
Do you know

389
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,920
what He Dajing liked?

390
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,880
For the past few days,

391
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,920
I've been dreaming about him.

392
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,230
But in my dreams,

393
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,950
I can't see his face clearly.

394
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,680
He had been with me
since he was a child.

395
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,950
But recently, I realized

396
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,830
that I didn't know him at all.

397
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,590
He liked drinking,

398
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,760
always carrying a wineskin.

399
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,160
He liked writing poetry.

400
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,560
I like to have a sip every day,

401
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,560
but I don't dare

402
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,470
in front of Mr. Wei.

403
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,160
So don't tell Mr. Wei

404
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,040
about our drinking today.

405
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,000
I didn't know all of this.

406
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,470
He was a timid child,

407
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,520
always careful
with what he said and did.

408
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,190
Being with me for more than ten years,

409
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,710
he never dared to speak out.

410
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,230
And I was mostly

411
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,680
criticizing

412
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,400
and nitpicking him.

413
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,680
My condolences, Mr. Wei.

414
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,280
He has gone.

415
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,880
I'm worried about you now.

416
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,400
Two days have passed.

417
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,640
Do you have any idea

418
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
where the fire started?

419
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,160
Jushui Entertainment House

420
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,800
is full of flammable materials.

421
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,760
It's hard to find where the fire started.

422
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,310
The Governor of Yangzhou, Chen Zhuliang.

423
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,590
Five years ago, for opposing
the establishment of the Empress,

424
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,560
he was demoted

425
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,280
to Yangzhou of Nanshan Circuit.

426
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:48,880
A few days ago,

427
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,430
he was forcibly poisoned

428
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:53,280
and killed by a forged imperial decree
with the Phoenix Seal on it.

429
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,880
It was because of this

430
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,190
that the theft of the Phoenix Seal
was uncovered.

431
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,920
But the 11th day of the fifth month...

432
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,070
It's exactly

433
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,680
the second day after the incident
at Jushui Entertainment House.

434
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,310
Is this related to the incident
at Jushui Entertainment House?

435
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,350
Yes.

436
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,760
That night,

437
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,560
someone went to
Jushui Entertainment House.

438
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,920
He knew there would be a fire

439
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,560
and locked the gate,

440
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,430
preventing anyone
from entering or leaving.

[Jushui Entertainment House]

442
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,640
It was a fluke

443
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,190
that I survived.

444
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,830
Who wanted to kill you?

445
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,680
He did not want to kill us.

446
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,880
The person he wanted to kill

447
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,800
was the palace maid
responsible for the Seal, Yaxin.

448
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:34,800
Yaxin

449
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,310
stole the Phoenix Seal
entrusted to her care.

450
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,430
After the deed was done,

451
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,470
she was silenced.

452
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,350
According to the report
from Wannian County,

453
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,560
the musician in charge
of Jushui Entertainment House

454
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,000
was from the same hometown as Yaxin.

455
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,800
So many people were implicated

456
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,640
because of Yaxin.

457
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:51,950
Did you report this to the magistrate
of Wannian County?

458
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,310
Not yet.

459
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,640
It is all

460
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,400
just my speculation.

461
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:57,880
There is no proof.

462
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,110
But the incident
at Jushui Entertainment House

463
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,950
and the loss of the Phoenix Seal

464
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,950
are inextricably linked.

465
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,520
I'm afraid the fire

466
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,830
was set by the one who stole the seal,

467
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,680
an enemy of the Empress.

468
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,160
You've read
so many Bulletins of the Court,

469
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,830
why don't you understand?

470
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,000
The Empress' reforms

471
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,950
have offended too many people.

472
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,590
What I want to say is

473
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,950
that Yangzhou's Bulletin of the Court

474
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,190
are not true.

475
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,310
I do not believe

476
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,190
anyone will resist the reforms.

477
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,710
What changed by the Empress's reform

478
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:37,470
of the imperial examination

479
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,160
was the monopoly of the eminent families.

480
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,520
The agricultural reforms

481
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,350
no longer penalize displaced migrants.

482
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,110
Allowing them to settle down nearby

483
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,310
and giving them farmland.

484
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,760
People can farm,

485
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
and plants can be grown.

486
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,520
This is what I've seen

487
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,920
with my own eyes

488
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,070
during my travels over the years.

489
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,680
Just because you saw it
with your own eyes,

490
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,000
does it mean it's true?

491
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
The Empress's Phoenix Seal is missing.

492
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,400
All the examination papers

493
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,190
have been sealed and stored

494
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,400
and won't be marked.

495
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,040
The Institute
for the Advancement of Literature

496
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,430
is now a mess.

497
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:18,230
Those who support the Empress
and those who oppose her

498
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,760
are fighting.

499
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,190
I've never had anything
to do with politics.

500
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,000
I'm too old and just want
to avoid trouble.

501
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:29,110
But you should know that in Chang'an,

502
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,830
there are too many people

503
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,280
who oppose the Empress.

504
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,470
They're so vicious

505
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:41,230
and don't need to hide.

506
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,400
They all have their own hidden agendas

507
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,710
and are all in high positions.

508
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,400
Chang'an

509
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,040
is not yours or mine.

510
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,400
It's theirs.

511
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:09,710
I wonder when you got this habit

512
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,160
of pilfering along the way.

513
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,830
How can you call this stealing?

514
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,560
I just took it in passing.

515
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,830
Okay, you just took it in passing.

516
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,830
But why didn't you
take something valuable?

517
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,830
What's the point

518
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,950
of taking this pile of junk?

519
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,430
It's called

520
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,070
souvenirs.

521
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,280
Wrong direction.

522
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,280
What are you up to?

523
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,350
Is Mr. Di around?

524
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,760
He's not.

525
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,710
I'll go find him.

526
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,280
He's not around.

527
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,950
Some things must be done
when he's not around.

528
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,350
Mr. Hong,

529
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,760
I was looking for you.

530
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,430
This is my handmade Biluo.

531
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,070
I have both sweet and salty flavors.

532
00:29:59,160 --> 00:29:59,830
Have a taste.

533
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,430
What's the matter?

534
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,230
Nothing.

535
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,920
If you have something to ask,
say it here.

536
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,800
You look like you have something
to ask of me.

537
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,110
If nothing, why so ingratiating?

538
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,400
I can't eat this.

539
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:15,070
I just want to get to know Mr. Di.

540
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,350
For example,

541
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,640
is there anyone else in this family?

542
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,640
Mr. Di's parents

543
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,280
died young.

544
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,710
Well,

545
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,760
does he have siblings?

546
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,190
No,

547
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,710
he's the only child.

548
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,760
Pity him then.

549
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,880
He's an orphan like me.

550
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,680
Even though

551
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,350
Mr. Di

552
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,800
is the only one left now,

553
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,190
he's from a family
that all works for the government,

554
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,430
not the same person

555
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,760
as he is now.

556
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,310
It has nothing to do
with his family background.

557
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,400
If one lives in the world

558
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,310
alone all the time,

559
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,640
one will feel lonely.

560
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,350
Are you worried

561
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,830
that he can't solve the case?

562
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,110
I'm not worried
that he can't solve the case.

563
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,430
- I'm worried about his...
- You're worried about his safety.

564
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,230
Mr. Hong,

565
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,400
don't worry.

566
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,190
From now on,

567
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,070
we will make sure he's safe,

568
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,190
just like you.

569
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,560
You're back.

570
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,560
Come on. Have a taste.

571
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,830
This is my handmade Biluo.

572
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,350
I'm not hungry.

573
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,590
At least try it.

574
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,350
This is the man you want to know.

575
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,800
That's the way he is.

576
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,160
You never know what he's thinking.

577
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,020
[Wei's Residence]

578
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,830
A burnt rope.

579
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,920
Someone set the fire...

580
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,710
and then

581
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,560
locked the escape door

582
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,640
with a leather cord from the outside.

583
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,160
This is never a Heavenly Fire.

584
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,070
Never.

585
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,310
A farmhouse on the outskirts
of Wannian County

586
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,000
[Day four]
was burned by a Heavenly Fire last night.

587
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:47,230
The report says four people died
in the fire.

588
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,280
What should we do?

589
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,560
Go. Call the coroner.

590
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,230
Magistrate,

591
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,830
the coroner suddenly fell ill
two days ago,

592
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,400
with a flushed face,
continuous sneezing,

593
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,280
and took sick leave at home.

594
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,640
Of all times, why now?

595
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,920
Let me try.

596
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,230
I know a bit about medicine.

597
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,230
Sure... Take a look.

598
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,190
What do you find?

599
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,160
The four bodies

600
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,710
are all male.

601
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,230
They have calluses on their palms

602
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,560
and purlicues.

603
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,280
They were all burned to death.

604
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,310
I know that!

605
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,520
Yeah.

606
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,470
Wait.

607
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,710
They already were dead

608
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,800
before the fire started.

609
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,310
In his mouth,

610
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,520
there's no dust.

611
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,640
I'll go into the scene and take a look.

612
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,640
You...

613
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:24,760
Follow him.

614
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,070
Yes.

615
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,110
I'll go in the scene, too.

616
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,160
It's burned to a crisp.

617
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,230
What kind of clues can we get?

618
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,070
Let's just do it.

619
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,000
What did you find?

620
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,680
At the murder scene,

621
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,400
anything found

622
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,160
must be turned over to the gover...

623
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:30,950
What's wrong?

624
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,830
It's just a bunch of dead silkworms.

625
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,310
What's the big deal?

626
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,040
You, go over there and check.

627
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:51,110
Why these silkworms?

628
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,430
What are you doing?

629
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,670
I want to take some silkworms

630
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:59,670
and check again.

631
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,670
No need to do so.

632
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:02,000
Someone,

633
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,230
take these bodies

634
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,840
and everything we found here

635
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,600
back to the office.

636
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:06,910
Come here. Clean this place up.

637
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:07,630
Wait...

638
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,000
Magistrate,

639
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,520
let me investigate again.

640
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,520
I'm sure I can find something.

641
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,120
No need to do so.

642
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,630
This case involves the palace.

643
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,950
It's out of my hands.

644
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,080
If you want to investigate,

645
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,120
go to see the Minister of Justice.

646
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:21,950
Go.

647
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:22,840
Magistrate,

648
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,600
let me investigate again, please.

649
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,000
Today

650
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,520
is the fourth day.

651
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,670
It's hot.

652
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,000
So hot...

653
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,000
It's so hot.

654
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,470
Don't you get it?

655
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,150
You can't solve this case.

656
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,950
It's a clash of giants.

657
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,040
It's so hot.

658
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:01,840
Hurry up.

659
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,000
Let's go.

660
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,710
Let's go back and rest.

661
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,670
Let's go. Hurry up.

662
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,320
- Yes.
- Yes.

663
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:08,910
Careful.

664
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,560
Watch out.

665
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,320
You've got something?

666
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,280
Look ahead. Slow down...

667
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,520
Okay.

668
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,080
Sure.

669
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,230
That magistrate of Wannian County said

670
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,870
''Why these silkworms?''

671
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,150
What does it mean?

672
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,670
Empress Wu emulates Empress Zhangsun

673
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,910
and performs rites on sericulture.

674
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,430
By traditional rites,

675
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:31,230
be close to people, raise silkworms,
and reel silk by herself.

676
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,800
Who raises silkworms near Chang'an?

677
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:34,870
So I'm afraid the silkworms

678
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,280
were from the rites on sericulture.

679
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,600
They were spread over farmhouses

680
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,710
to show the Empress's

681
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,870
virtue of caring for all the people.

682
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,190
So this is just an ordinary farmhouse.

683
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,600
It's a farmhouse,

684
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,800
but maybe

685
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,230
it's not ordinary.

686
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,360
I'm afraid those people there

687
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,710
aren't ordinary farmers either.

688
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,040
What do you mean?

689
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,390
There must be something on the bodies.

690
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:58,910
The problem

691
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,120
is I'm not authorized to examine them.

692
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,360
I can't go any further.

693
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,560
If we walk back to Chang'an like this,

694
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,230
how long do we have to walk? I...

695
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,390
Heaven help the good ones.

696
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,840
There are three. Just one for each of us.

697
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:20,390
Wait.

698
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,280
Four.

699
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,230
That's weird.

700
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,120
These horses don't look like wild horses.

701
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,230
I've seen these horses before.

702
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,020
[Daning Ward]

703
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,560
They're the Yulin Guards.
