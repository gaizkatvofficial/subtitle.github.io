It is Loong who killed that couple.

7
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,920
Look at these words on the tags.

8
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,880
What are these words?

9
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,000
They are even worse than my handwriting.

10
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,720
Worse than your handwriting.

11
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,680
Then, how could he teach that couple

to play Xiangqi?
[*Chinese chess]

13
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,960
The heart and the knife are here,

and they are physical evidence.

15

It's the person who coerced him
into self-castration.

[Lanfang County Magistrate's Office]

21
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,640
From the butcher's appearance,

22
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,960
I feel he couldn't make the paper effigy.

23
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,480
No need to investigate further, Hong.

24
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,960
The paper effigy and Loong

25
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,560
have nothing to do with each other.

26
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,240
All over the paper effigy,

27
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,480
not a single speck of grease can be found.

28
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,200
Loong was a butcher

29

who had been selling pork.

30
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,160
He was unrelated to the paper effigy.

34
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,200

that Heiyan did these?

They fear getting involved,

59
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,960
so they keep silent about what they know

60
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,880
and don't report crimes they witness.

65

I don't know

who made this thing.

110
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,760
I just feel the paper effigy is familiar.

111
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,560
But the paper effigy is not a portrait.

112
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,480
It couldn't be made to resemble someone.

113
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,680
It should be a coincidence.

114
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,760
Who does it resemble?

115
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,440

Exactly.

00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,080
Did you buy it?

146
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,480

This is my daughter's room.

it's still exactly the same as before.

This pair of earrings

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,200
is very valuable.

158
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,000
I am old,

159
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,960
and I have only one daughter.

160
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,760

did you last see the earrings?

164

175

During those years,

176
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,800
[Xiao's Dyeing House]
the business was doing well.

177
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,960
So, I wanted

178
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,960
to open another shop

179
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,320
to incorporate the sale

180
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,280
of ready-made clothes.

181
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,960
Chunyu came up with the idea

182
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,320
of making some paper effigies.

183
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,560
She said

184
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,520
that we could put those clothes

185
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,800
on the paper effigies.

186
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,800
So, the size

187
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,680
and style

188
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,680
would be clear to people at a glance.

189
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,840
In this way,
the business would be better.

190
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
She had been skillful

191

00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,440
could make those paper effigies.

194
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,760
But before the business got better,

195
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,760
she was gone.

196
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:39,960
Shopkeeper Xiao,

197
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,680
please tell us more about what happened

198
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,520
to Chunyu back then.

199
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,060
[Loong's Butchery]

200
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,120
All of this

201
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,400
conforms to Loong's testimony.

202
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,560
Even now,
I can still remember it very clearly.

203
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,120
If Chu Lei

204
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,480
knew Loong could see it clearly,

205
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,000
why did he

206
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,360
choose to commit the crime at that time?

207
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,200
Such a ruthless criminal

208
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,160
wouldn't care about it at all.

209
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,260
[Chu Lei]

210
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,520
Did you witness

211
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,960
all these with your own eyes?

212
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,640
No.

213
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,040
Then how would you know so clearly?

214
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,640
After my daughter was abducted,

215
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,840
the room was in a mess.

216
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,400
It was the magistrate at that time

217
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,920
who made this inference.

218
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,880
Where were you

219
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,000
when the crime occurred?

220
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,880
I was in the house next door.

221
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,720
How come you didn't hear the commotion

222
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,680
in your daughter's room?

223
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,040
I was in a very deep sleep.

224
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,880
From the case file,

225
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,320
Chu Lei was arrested

226
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,800
based on Loong's testimony,

227
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:22,800
right?

228
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:23,920
Yes.

229
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,560
Chu Lei

230
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,760
committed the crime late at night,

231
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,000
yet Loong recognized him immediately.

232
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,760
They must have known

233
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,960
each other before.

234
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,760
Chu Lei had been coveting
my daughter for a long time.

235
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
Before he enlisted,

236
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,080
he often came to harass her.

237
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,800
Loong lives across from our house,

238
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,680
[Loong's Butchery]
so he surely had met Chu Lei.

239
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,120
Chu Lei

240
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,440
used to be in the military?

241
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,400
Yeah.

242
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,520
What did he do for a living

243
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,160
before getting enlisted?

244
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,360
He was just a useless poor scholar.

245
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,160
Why would a scholar

246
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,520
suddenly join the military?

247
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,400
I had told him

248
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,600
if he could make something of himself,

249
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,480
I would consider
marrying my daughter to him.

250
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,920
Let go of my daughter!

251
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,200
Get lost!

252
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,440
If you don't have any accomplishments,

253
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,440
you'll never see my daughter again.

254
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,520
Leave!

255
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:17,920
Chunyu...

256
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,200
Just leave!

257
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,440
Hurry up!

258
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,120
Wait for me.

259
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,080
So, he joined the military

260
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,880
and declared

261
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,160
that he would return to marry her
after achieving success.

262
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,040
But as soon as he left,

263
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,000
you married your daughter
to someone else?

264
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,240
I can't marry my daughter to him

265
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,720
and condemn her to a life of poverty.

266
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,880
But what I heard is

267
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,240
Chu Lei died in prison

268
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,160
soon after being arrested.

269
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,520
He never

270
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,360
admitted to killing Chunyu,

271
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,680
even until his death.

272
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,520
I didn't kill Chunyu!

273
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,520
I was set up!

274
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,560
No murderer

275
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,440
would admit their guilt easily.

276
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,080
Indeed.

277
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,280
That makes sense.

278
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,920
Chunyu's body

279
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,600
is still missing now,

280
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,040
and Chu Lei had died for years.

281
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,960
A life for a life.

282
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,760
I'll regard it
as water under the bridge.

283
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,400
Do you know Mr. Chen the Sixth
and his wife?

284
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,200
Who?

285
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,720
The newlywed farmers,

286
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,400
Mr. Chen

287
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,040
and his wife.

288
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,240
I run a dyeing house.

289
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,080
I don't know farmers.

290
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,160
Thank you for your cooperation.

291
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,640
Magistrate,

292
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,320
I think there are many suspicious points

293
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,520
in Chunyu's case.

294
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,160
Of course.

295
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,720
Currently, only Chunyu

296
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,760
can link all the cases together.

297
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,280
Loong

298
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,160
was a witness in Chunyu's case.

299
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,960
The earrings

300
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,600
worn by the farmer's wife

301
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,200
belonged to Chunyu.

302
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,320
The paper effigy could be made
by Chunyu.

303
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,600
As for the skull...

304
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,360
You think it's Chunyu's skull?

305
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,160
If so,

306
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,560
the murderer

307
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,800
came for revenge for the old case.

308
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,040
Then it all makes sense.

309
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,880
Where was Chu Lei buried

310
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,920
after his death?

311
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,240
The mass grave in the west of the city.

312
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,880
Stop looking for it.

313
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,000
Even if we find his tombstone,

314
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,280
we wouldn't know

315
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,120
if the person buried there

316
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,760
is Chu Lei or not.

317
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,280
It's been 10 years.

318
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,080
I should have thought of it.

319
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,200
Who arranged his burial

320
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,320
when he died?

321
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,800
The file recorded a person named

322
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,960
Lin Fan.

323
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,480
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

324
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,960
We should have gone to Lin Fan directly.

325
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,600
What's the point of coming to this place?

326
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,840
Whammy!

327
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,760
You didn't ask.

328
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,480
Let's go. Stop playing with dead bones.

329
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,640
Digging out the heart and lungs.

330
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,800
Castration.

331
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,680
These must have been done
by evil spirits.

332
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,280
Exactly. So poor of the victims.

333
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:17,960
It was said

334
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,040
that the victims did it themselves.

335
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,480
Loong castrated himself

336
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,680
with his

337
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,840
own hands.

338
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,200
He harassed those girls.
He asked for it.

339
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,480
Have you heard about that couple?

340
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,680
They killed each other,

341
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,120
digging out each other's hearts.

342
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,520
How miserable!

343
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,160
Think carefully
about the mistakes we made

344
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,160
and just pray.

345
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,640
We should

346
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,120
do more good deeds.

347
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,800
Miss Cao,

348
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,120
is Magistrate Di stressed out lately?

349
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,800
Why?

350
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,640
I've heard

351
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,760
about the cases lately.

352
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,200
Everyone is jittery.

353
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,640
Miss Cao,

354
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,200
you cherish the instrument.

355
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,200
But

356
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,590
the damage

357
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,110
must have been caused by a fall.

358
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,070
I guess

359
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,880
Magistrate Di accidentally

360
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,040
let this musical instrument fall.

361
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,110
Miss Cao,

362
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,110
that's a mason I hired.

363
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,350
I'm planning

364
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,280
to erect a new tombstone

365
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,720
for my deceased father.

366
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:20,840
Miss Cao.

367
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:21,840
Darling,

368
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,800
why aren't you staying in the backyard?

369
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What are you doing here?

370
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,800
He has finished his work.

371
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,000
He heard Miss Cao had arrived,

372
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,440
so he came to pay his respects.

373
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,240
I appreciate your politeness.

374
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,200
Say something.

375
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,200
Feel free to speak.

376
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,160
Let me help him.

377
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,520
The thing is,

378
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,440
he heard the Magistrate

379
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,000
has closed Loong's Butchery.

380
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,360
He had ordered sausages from there

381
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,320
but hadn't picked them up.

382
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,440
Although Loong is dead,

383
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,160
his death should have nothing to do
with those sausages.

384
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,560
He usually enjoys a drink with sausages,

385
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,720
and the sausages cost him a lot.

386
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,160
He cherishes his hard-earned money.

387
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,040
So, he wants to ask you a favor,

388
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,360
which is to speak to Magistrate Di

389
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,680
and give him the sausages.

390
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,080
I heard there were wooden signs

391
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,880
with names and addresses written
on them.

392
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,640
May I have your name?

393
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,120
I'll tell the Magistrate once I return.

394
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:23,960
[Lin Fan]
Lin Fan.

395
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,640
My name is Lin Fan.

396
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,520
Thank you, Miss Cao.

397
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,240
I'll take my leave first.

398
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,360
Father.

399
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,040
Father,

400
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,120
help me save it.

401
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,160
[Young Di Renjie]
Father.

402
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,120
Father,

403
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,480
help me save it.

404
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,920
Father...

405
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,640
You've read the letter.

406
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,000
Please consider it.

407
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,520
Don't tell me such things.

408
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,720
Get out of here!

409
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,440
Get out!

410
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,760
I'll come back again.

411
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:04,880
Hong,

412
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,360
who is that man?

413
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,280
Someone your father doesn't like.

414
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,800
Father,

415
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,800
I just saved a bird,

416
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,400
but it seems to be injured.

417
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:21,840
Here,

418
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,080
let me check on it.

419
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,600
Its wings are injured.

420
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,000
Go get some medicinal wine.

421
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,600
Okay.

422
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,080
The bird will be able to fly home

423
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,640
if we cure it.

424
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,800
It's a skylark that you saved.

425
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,120
Skylarks miss their home

426
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,600
the most.

427
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,200
No matter where they are taken,

428
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,720
they will do whatever it takes

429
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,320
to fly back home.

430
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,880
Only then can they feel at ease.

431
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:05,840
Huaiying,

432
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,480
what's the matter?

433
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,640
I had a dream.

434
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,640
Why aren't you sleeping yet?

435
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,680
I have something

436
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,560
to tell you.

437
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,080
You've been busy these days.

438
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,400
I'm afraid I won't see you tomorrow.

439
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,160
I met

440
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,680
a mason today

441
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,200
when I had my instrument repaired.

442
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,960
He wanted to ask you for a favor.

443
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,600
Tell me.

444
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,200
He said

445
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,720
he wanted to pick up

446
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,640
the sausages he ordered from Loong.

447
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,760
They cost him

448
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,080
a lot of money.

449
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,920
He doesn't want

450
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,960
to waste the money.

451
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,280
But that mason...

452
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,960
What happened to him?

453
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,480
Huaiying,

454
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:03,840
look.

455
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,600
This is the annual name list

456
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,000
of enlistment in Yonghui County.

457
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,160
These are the reasons
why Lin Fan collected Chu Lei's body.

458
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,080
[Name List]
They joined the army

459
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,360
in the same year.

460
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,360
Lin Fan?

461
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,040
The mason I talked about just now

462
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,640
is also called Lin Fan.

463
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,840
He is Lin Fan...

464
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,580
[Loong's Butchery]

465
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,420
[Huang]

466
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,060
[Chun]

467
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,540
[Lin]

468
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,320
Magistrate,

469
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,440
do you really think Lin Fan

470
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,720
is the murderer?

471
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,600
Not sure.

472
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,720
Do you think

473
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,160
Lin Fan might have killed
the three people

474
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,720
out of comradeship?

475
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,200
Find a package

476
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,760
to wrap the sausages in.

477
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,180
[Chunyu]

478
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:47,180
[Lin]

479
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,000
Lin Fan.

480
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,920
I have said before

481
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,640
that I would take these
by myself once informed.

482
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,080
How dare I trouble you

483
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,640
to deliver these personally?

484
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,000
You know me?

485
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,200
When you held court trials,

486
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,560
I went to see them.

487
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,360
So I remember your look.

488
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Are these

489
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,160
made by you?

490
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,880
Yes, that's right.

491
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,240
It seems

492
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,320
you have been a mason for years.

493
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,680
For five years.

494
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,480
Who was your mentor?

495
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,760
I didn't have a mentor.

496
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,480
I learned these by myself.

497
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,160
You are talented.

498
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,520
That's too much praise.

499
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,000
Carry on with your business.

500
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,840
Before you became a mason,

501
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,880
how did you make a living?

502
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,240
I worked in gambling houses and inns.

503
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,680
I had been an ironsmith and farmer.

504
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,720
I tried many kinds of jobs.

505
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,760
And before that?

506
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,600
What do you mean by "before that"?

507
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,080
The first year of the Yonghui Reign.

508
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,360
These are the reasons
why Lin Fan collected Chu Lei's body.

509
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,900
Beat him!

510
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,680
Lin Fan.

511
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,160
As a soldier stationed at the border,

512
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,200
what haven't you seen?

513
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,000
Stop acting.

514
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,480
I'm a deserter.

515
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,920
As you have seen through me,

516
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,320
please spare my life, Magistrate.

517
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,360
Raise your head.

518
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,720
Whether you are a deserter or not,

519
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,560
I don't care.

520
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:37,880
I came here

521
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,120
not to catch you

522
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,200
but to investigate a case.

523
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,440
Sit down.

524
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,240
Sit down.

525
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,920
Let's continue with the topic.

526
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,760
You are a deserter.

527
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,800
You've already fled,

528
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,960
so why not go into hiding

529
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,560
and move to another place?

530
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,600
Magistrate, you may not know it.

531
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,600
Before you came here,

532
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,560
outlaws were rampant in Lanfang County.

533
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,320
Even the previous Magistrate's Office

534
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,320
was burnt by them.

535
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,320
Among these outlaws,

536
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,960
some are also deserters.

537
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,440
My real name

538
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,800
cannot be hidden.

539
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,720
But it is also because of this

540
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,240
that they protected me

541
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,560
and I have survived.

542
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,320
Comradeship.

543
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,640
Sort of.

544
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,680
For comradeship,

545
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,040
you collected someone's corpse.

546
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,120
I thought you came

547
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,480
to catch me

548
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,800
because I am a deserter.

549
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,640
I didn't know

550
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,840
you came for Chu Lei and Chunyu's case.

551
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,320
I didn't mention this,

552
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,320
and you know

553
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,040
I came for Chunyu's case.

554
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,840
Isn't it being talked about everywhere?

555
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,000
Well,

556
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,600
about Chu Lei,

557
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,440
what do you know?

558
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,360
Though we were comrade-in-arms,

559
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,480
we were not that familiar to each other.

560
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,160
I collected his corpse

561
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,720
out of morality.

562
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,600
The Magistrate's Office was burnt down,

563
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,720
but the case files are still intact.

564
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,560
The file says clearly

565
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,080
that you and Chu Lei

566
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,960
were in the same troop

567
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,080
and had faced life and death together.

568
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,640
You said

569
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,440
you were not familiar with him.

570
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,040
Are you kidding me?

571
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,200
That was more than a decade ago.

572
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,360
Even if you know everything about him,

573
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,040
can you

574
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,360
dig him out of his grave

575
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,680
and investigate the case?

576
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,280
How to investigate a case

577
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,960
is my business.

578
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,160
All you need to do
is answer my question.

579
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,400
During that year,

580
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,040
Heiyan brought chaos to society.

581
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,720
Even the Magistrate's Office
was burnt down.

582
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,600
An unimportant prisoner

583
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,040
died.

584
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,520
Who would care about this?

585
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,080
But when did he die?

586
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,520
How did he die?

587
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,360
Moreover,

588
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,400
was

589
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,520
the dead man really Chu Lei?

590
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,200
Who knows about it?

591
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,680
Magistrate,

592
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,160
you have doubts
about what happened before.

593
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,840
I really can't explain it.

594
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,680
Tell me.

595
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,200
Let's start with why Chu Lei
enlisted in the army.

596
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,920
Chu Lei

597
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,360
told me in person

598
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,560
[Chunyu]
that he enlisted in the army

599
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,600
because he wanted to be successful.

600
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,960
That way,
he could go back to marry Chunyu.

601
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,680
Give it back to me!

602
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,520
Actually,

603
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,440
every soldier knew well

604
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,040
that we were two weak scholars.

605
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,640
We weren't fit to be soldiers at all.

606
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,840
Every day in the military

607
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,520
felt like an eternity.

608
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,720
I was insulted every day.

609
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,280
So was he.

610
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,880
Kill me.

611
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,600
I can't do it myself.

612
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:07,800
Look,

613
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,360
I used a piece of tile to cut myself.

614
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,280
It hurts.

615
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,000
I can't bear it.

616
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,640
One day,

617
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,240
I thought of fleeing.

618
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,440
I knew

619
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,280
if we got caught,

620
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,080
it would be beyond redemption.

621
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,640
But I didn't care at all.

622
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,080
I could only remember
all the humiliations.

623
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,440
According to the rule
of the border army,

624
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,160
if a soldier runs away and gets caught,

625
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,680
he'll be left hanging
under the blazing sun for seven days.

626
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,760
If he survived,

627
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,600
he could be forgiven.

628
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,120
But no one could survive for five days.

629
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,920
However, the heaven lets us survive.

630
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,840
On the fifth day,

631
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,360
it rained.

632
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,320
From that day on,

633
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,960
everything changed.

634
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,480
- He stopped showing mercy to anyone.
- Come on!

635
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,040
He seemed to have lost his heart.

636
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,920
He was like an empty shell.

637
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,920
But I heard

638
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,720
Chu Lei

639
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,680
was a useless poor scholar.

640
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,760
A villain?

641
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,680
Once,

642
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,440
we were dispatched to a village
to suppress the rebellion.

643
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,960
Chu Lei served as the leader
for the first time,

644
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,320
commanding the battle.

645
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,600
It was more of a massacre

646
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,200
than suppressing the rebellion.

647
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,760
Kill him!

648
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,280
Please don't.

649
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,400
I'm begging you.

650
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,920
Don't kill me.

651
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,440
Don't care about who they are.

652
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,360
They are worthless things,

653
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,000
not humans.

654
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,160
Chu Lei went on a killing spree

655
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,360
and became a man of no scruples.

656
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,200
Before he enlisted,

657
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,800
he was kind, indeed.

658
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,280
But after that,

659
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,520
he became extremely ruthless.

660
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,400
Magistrate,

661
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,680
do you know

662
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,200
what kind of person Chu Lei was now?

663
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,200
No one stopped him

664
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,480
from slaughtering innocents?

665
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,600
People in the military

666
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,240
cover for each other.

667
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,720
This is the rule.

668
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,920
It's been more than a decade.

669
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,040
If you don't believe me,

670
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,840
just treat it
as if you've heard a story.

671
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,560
Heiyan.

672
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:29,920
Lin Fan,

673
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,320
what do you think of Heiyan?

674
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,240
Do you know

675
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,040
villains in Lanfang County

676
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,320
are all afraid of Heiyan?

677
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,560
When I returned from the military,

678
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,040
I had to survive the chaos.

679
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,920
Indeed,

680
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,680
I thought about joining Heiyan.

681
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,160
But you showed up and defeated Heiyan.

682
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,400
Thanks to you,
I didn't make the mistake.

683
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,360
Defeated Heiyan.

684
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,400
You said I defeated Heiyan

685
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,360
instead

686
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,800
of wiping them out.

687
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,040
It indicates

688
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,960
that in your heart,

689
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,630
you know Heiyan still exists.

690
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,600
Let's end our conversation.

691
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,630
I'll come to see you again.

692
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,040
Zhao, the blacksmith.

693
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,520
Here, here.

694
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,560
Thanks a lot.

695
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,960
What's written here?

696
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,480
You are here to get the sausages, too?

697
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,200
Wang, the tailor.

698
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,000
Here, here.

699
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:03,920
Thanks!

700
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,280
It's really delicious!

701
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,280
You only care about eating.

702
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,200
You dare to eat something
made by a dead person?

703
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,160
Haven't you heard the discussions?

704
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,440
You'll get your turn sooner or later.

705
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,680
Go back now.

706
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,480
Go back!

707
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,320
Go!

708
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,080
Trying to beat a woman?

709
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,040
Is he really a man?

710
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,840
What a waste!

711
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,440
Mr. Zhao (the Sixth).

712
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,560
It's me.

713
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,560
They say the meat is delicious.

714
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,800
Let's take it back to the Magistrate.

715
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,160
Miss Cao,

716
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,280
why don't you leave the sewing

717
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,480
to the servants?

718
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,680
I have nothing to do.

719
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,920
I can handle it without bothering others.

720
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,160
Alright.

721
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,760
The instrument repairer is waiting
for you outside.

722
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,000
I'll go take a look.

723
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:24,300
[Rong]

724
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,880
[Lanfang County Magistrate's Office]

725
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,600
Miss Cao,

726
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,360
I fixed it.

727
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,480
Here you are.

728
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:37,760
Thank you.

729
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,520
By the way,

730
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,640
I have some tasks to do in my shop,

731
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,280
so I'll take my leave first.

732
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,120
Thank you again.

733
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,280
Take my instrument back to the house.

734
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:04,640
Okay.

735
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,600
Miss Cao,

736
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,400
it's getting dark. Where are you going?

737
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,200
Just walking around. I'll be back soon.

738
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,580
