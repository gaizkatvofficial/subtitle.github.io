I've never figured it out.

00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,640
What?

124

Kang Zhiyi

How to explain?

132
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,080
Because the person

133
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,080
who set the fire wasn't Kang Zhiyi at all.

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,790
Then who was it?

136
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,710
The root cause of the fire

137
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,880
was the spontaneous combustion
of Tanshi in the wine flask

138
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,080
that He Dajing had with him.

139
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,840
And you put that stone

140
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,840
in He Dajing's wine flask.

141

You actually know him well.

143
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,080
You know

144
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,710
he was used to carrying a wine flask.

145
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,640
On the examination day,

146
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,790
you put Tanshi

147
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,230
in his wine flask.

148
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,230
Because Tanshi was soaked in the wine,

149
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,670
it won't burn immediately.

150
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,150
You've calculated it carefully

151
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,200
drilled a small hole
in the bottom of the flask.

152

After

153
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,150
about two to three hours,

154
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,000
the wine would run out.

155
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,640
Tanshi

156
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,960
would set He Dajing on fire

157
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,910
in the examination room
by spontaneous combustion.

158
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,350
Then, you would achieve your goal

of sabotaging the exam.

160
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,760
What you didn't consider

161
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,760
is that this year's exams

162
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,350
have added a new supervision system.

163
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,710
Wine flasks

164
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,840
are no longer allowed to be brought
into the exam room.

165
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,230
To prevent He Dajing

166
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,760
from finishing the wine in advance,

167
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,470
you put Huanglian

168
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,670
on the spout of the flask.

169
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,910
That's why your Heavenly Fire didn't start

170
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,910
until we arrived

171
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,000
at the Jushui Pavilion.

172
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,030
You made a perfect plan,

173
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:12,960
but

174
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,550
Heaven's plans supersede our own.

175
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,790
He Dajing is my student.

176
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,400
He's also my assistant.

177
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,000
Why would I want to hurt him?

178
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,110
Confucius said,

179
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,080
"Only women and small-minded men

180
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,150
are hard to deal with".

181
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,110
This statement is wrong.

182
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,230
[Nonsense.]
"When it comes to women,

183
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,400
[Not distinguish yin and yang.]
even though they

184
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,000
[Violate the rules of order and propriety]

185
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
are arrogant and willful,

186
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,640
treat her the way we treat men,

187
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,960
support and help along the good,

188
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,030
correct and lessen the consequences
of the bad,

189
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,150
embrace her nature,

190
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:43,820
and through this,

191
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,280
earn the title of "Junzi".
[*Junzi: an ideal person in Confucianism.]

192
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,590
His Majesty's

193
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,910
acceptance of women

194
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,320
has become

195
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,590
cowardice in your eyes.

196
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,790
If I hadn't stumbled upon

197
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,350
your comments
on the Crown Prince's article,

198
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,960
I wouldn't have been able
to figure out your motives.

199
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Your hatred for Empress Wu

200
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,400
is as great as that of Zhangsun Qing's,
right?

201
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:13,590
No.

202
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,670
He's still tied to his position

203
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,840
and has the fear of death.

204
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,320
Just because she's a woman,

205
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,440
you hate her

206
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,200
more than Zhangsun Qing.

207
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,200
What proof do you have?

208
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,640
After the examination,

209
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,640
you followed us

210
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,200
to the Jushui Pavilion.

211
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,960
This is what I found at the scene.

212
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,840
It's the leather rope you used
to tie up the scrolls.

213
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:53,320
Mr. Wei.

214
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,760
I didn't expect it

215
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,150
to be you.

216
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,590
Heaven's plans supercede our own.

217
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,960
Tanshi is unstable.

218
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,790
I really didn't know

219
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,440
when it would burn.

220
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,640
But I've thought about it.

221
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,470
If it burns inside the exam room,

222
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,840
it'll have a ten percent effect.

223
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,110
If it burns outside the exam room,

224
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,440
it'll have 50 or 60 percent effect.

225
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,230
But I never thought

226
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,640
that it burned in the lair
of the demon empress.

227
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,110
The effect was 100 percent.

228
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,230
Even Heaven is helping me,

229
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,710
but why do you go against it?

230
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,590
When you did all this,

231
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,400
[He Dajing's Spirit Tablet]
have you ever considered him?

232
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:06,960
Your Heavenly Fire

233
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,200
was created.

234
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,000
And then what?

235
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,320
You poisoned the horse

236
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,910
and tampered with the stirrups.

237
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,000
You recommended the Yuntie cuffs

238
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,350
to the magistrate of Wannian County.

239
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,550
This way, you can silence me

240
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,520
and frame Zhangsun Qing for it.

241
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,550
Huaiying,

242
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,960
you're smart,

243
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,840
but you really don't know

244
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,150
what you're doing.

245
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,790
This witch

246
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,590
is planning a big conspiracy.

247
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,080
If Tang falls into her hands
in the future,

248
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,520
I don't know what it will become.

249
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,760
You're young and reckless.

250
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,110
You think all the new is good and right.

251
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,280
But the "new"

252
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,550
means changes,

253
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:03,960
chaos,

254
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,110
severed heads and bloodshed,

255
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,230
and saber rattling and fight.

256
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,590
Huaiying,

257
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,400
aren't you afraid?

258
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:15,670
Fairness

259
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:16,840
and prosperity.

260
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,590
That's what I see as the result
of the reforms.

261
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,880
Even if I'm afraid,

262
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,760
it's worth a try.

263
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,320
Mr. Wei.

264
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:30,910
please stop now.

265
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,400
I've told you.

266
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,790
People can't escape their own fate.

267
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,520
Mr. Wei.

268
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,310
Even if you found me, what can you do?

269
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,470
As long as the demon empress's opponents
are not eliminated,

270
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,920
the Heavenly Fire won't be extinguished.

271
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,160
Sooner or later,

272
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,310
it'll burn her to death.

273
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,640
Wait.

274
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:50,950
Keep him alive.

is the domain of the Zhangsun family.

280
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,590
Take this sword

281
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,230
as evidence

282
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,680
and notify the magistrate
of Wannian County

283
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,040

the Imperial Court of Justice

and Censorate

332
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,560
held a state trial for him.

333
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,520
Kang Zhiyi confessed

334
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,560
that Zhangsun Qing ordered him
to steal the Phoenix Seal.

335
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,830
Before he could kill Yaxin,

336
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,470
someone else killed Yaxin first.

337
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,280
So he followed the same method,

338
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,350
killed four Yulin guards who delivered

339
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,400
the forged imperial decree

340
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,880
to frame the Empress

341
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,880
for the Heavenly Fire murder

342
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,350
and achieve the purpose
of deposing the Empress.

343
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,230
Everything

344
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,430
was as you expected.

345
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,590
Zhangsun Qing denied it.

346
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,640
He said Kang Zhiyi framed him.

347
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,280
His Majesty had the Zhangsun's Residence
searched,

348
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,520
but the Phoenix Seal was not found.

349
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,880
It's a big problem to catch a criminal
without evidence.

350
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,920
And Zhangsun Qing
is a relative of the Emperor.

351
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,280
That's why His Majesty

352
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,710
has not made a decision

353
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,400
on Zhangsun Qing's case until today.

354
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,560
Where is he now?

355
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,350
He's been in the Qinglong Temple.

356
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,400
Even when he knew

357
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,160
the Zhangsun's Residence was searched,

358
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,230
he didn't come out.

359
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,310
So today,

360
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,950
His Majesty and the Empress

361
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,160
are going to the Qinglong Temple

362
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,470
to confront him and ask him to confess.

363
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,640
Your Majesty,

364
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:51,430
we guarantee Grand Commandant Zhangsun
is innocent.

365
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,470
Your Majesty,

366
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,230
please help defend Mr. Zhangsun.

367
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,160
Your Majesty,

368
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,160
please don't wrong Grand Commandant

369
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,430
with the words of a petty man.

370
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,070
You...

371
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,160
I hope you will make a fair judgment

372
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,400
and clear Grand Commandant's name.

373
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,040
Your Highness and Your Majesty
are one and the same.

374
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,680
There's no such thing as a power struggle.

375
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,640
Grand Commandant Zhangsun
is loyal to the court.

376
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,590
He'd never do something dirty like this.

377
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,070
Everyone,

378
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,280
rise.

379
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,000
Your Majesty, don't worry.

380
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,230
I'll go talk to Uncle.

381
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,880
Thank you, Zitong.

382
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:47,190
What a devout look.

383
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,590
It's said that Zhangsun Qing

384
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:53,040
has ordered candles of 20000 guan of money

385
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,640
for a blessing.

386
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,430
20000 guan of money.

387
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,110
It's enough to supply the soldiers

388
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,350
battling in Turk for months.

389
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,160
The candles keep burning day and night.

390
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,710
How much longer can they burn?

391
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,880
Since I became the Empress,

392
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:13,000
I've offended Zhangsun Qing's interests.

393
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,680
He's been trying to bring Kang Zhiyi in

394
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,560
and make me beleaguered.

395
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,430
At the beginning of this month,
he even burned down the Wutong tree

396
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,110
and create a public outcry against me.

397
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,110
If I don't do something,

398
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,350
I'll die.

399
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,920
This new path

400
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,470
will also die.

401
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,160
Fortunately,

402
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,520
Heaven helped me

403
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,470
to have you.

404
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:05,880
Come on.

405
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,470
Take a bet with me.

406
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,800
Five blacks are called "Lu".

407
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,710
Two whites and three blacks
are called "Xiao".

408
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,950
It's a vulgar trick.

409
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,350
These dice have lead dust

410
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,710
in them.

411
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,760
Some things

412
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,950
seem like fate,

413
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,560
but there's someone else's hand

414
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,160
where you can't see it.

415
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,310
If you're smart enough

416
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,590
to see through it,

417
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,760
you can join them

418
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,430
and dictate the fate of others.

419
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,430
To pray

420
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,470
and study Buddhism,

421
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,710
you need to be sincere.

422
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,040
If it's only for your own selfish desires,

423
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,520
don't defile

424
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,680
this pure sanctuary.

425
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,110
You're right, Uncle.

426
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,760
For this blessing,

427
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,520
I'm honored to study Buddhism

428
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,110
with you.

429
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,230
Uncle,

430
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,680
I have something to say.

431
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,230
I don't know if I should say it or not.

432
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,190
Now that you've said it,

433
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,520
why hide it?

434
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,160
I don't understand.

435
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,400
This is our family business.

436
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,800
Why do you have to make it public?

437
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,680
Heaven's rules and order supersede Heaven.

438
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,710
If we don't let the world judge,

439
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,950
it's not fair.

440
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,680
Let the world judge.

441
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,680
You're right, Uncle.

442
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,430
I won't forget it.

443
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,230
Your Highness,

444
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,430
it's the Zi hour now.

445
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,350
Uncle,

446
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,070
is there really no room for maneuver?

447
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,110
If you knew it would come to this,

448
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,040
why didn't you do it in the first place?

449
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,590
Wouldn't it be better

450
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:26,070
to be the motherly model of the world,

451
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,110
the Empress?

452
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,190
The Phoenix Seal.

453
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,520
We found the Phoenix Seal.

454
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,160
General Kang.

455
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:00,950
I'm here.

456
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,350
Have my candles

457
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,110
been sent to the Qinglong Temple?

458
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,470
Your Highness, rest assured.

459
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,880
I've delivered them myself.

460
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,230
Good.

461
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,760
Now, it's down to the last

462
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,560
and most convincing hit.

463
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,830
We can't let him have any chance
to come back.

464
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,760
The Phoenix Seal is really in the hands
of Grand Commandant Zhangsun.

465
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,950
Grand Commandant...

466
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,350
What should we do now?

467
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,190
Why is the Phoenix Seal here?

468
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,070
The Phoenix Seal is here.

469
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,040
What a trick.

470
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,680
You female savage.

471
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,520
Heaven will punish you.

472
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:51,560
The seal

473
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,710
was never lost.

474
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,880
The seal is just like a title.

475
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,400
It's all just vanity.

476
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,680
But the power behind that illusion

477
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,560
is real.

478
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,040
Even if Yaxin didn't die that night,

479
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,560
the next day,

480
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,110
she would have shown up

481
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,470
and been caught by the Jinwu Guards

482
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:16,430
and told the truth
about stealing the seal,

483
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:17,800
thus

484
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,310
exposing the collusion

485
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:21,470
between General Kang

486
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,760
and Grand Commandant Zhangsun.

487
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,470
I see.

488
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,560
After Yaxin's death,

489
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,230
you ordered Kang

490
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,070
to have the four Yulin Guards
who delivered the forged imperial decree

491
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,070
and killed Chen Zhuliang

492
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,560
kill themselves in the silkworm house.

493
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,190
Then,

494
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,070
you burned the silkworm house,

495
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:39,470
creating a heavenly punishment on purpose

496
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:41,640
so that Grand Commandant Zhangsun
could take advantage of it

497
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,110
and perform a series of plays

498
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,830
to stir up public outcry,

499
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,400
digging his own grave.

500
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:47,950
Your Highness,

501
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,560
more than a dozen lives

502
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,800
have gone to their deaths.

503
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,190
Was it worth it?

504
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,430
Whether it's worth it or not,

505
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:58,520
you and I can't say.

506
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:01,190
We have to ask the people of the world.

507
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,710
Your Highness is the motherly model
of the world.

508
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,110
Zhangsun Qing

509
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:16,710
and the courtiers following him

510
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,190
are in cahoots

511
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,680
and rotten to the core.

512
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,520
They

513
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,110
are not my enemies.

514
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,950
They're the enemies of the Tang.

515
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,640
It's so beautiful.

516

Look, it's flying so high.

00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,360
The phoenix alights on the Wutong tree.

All birds look up to the phoenix.

Come on and take a closer look.

522

00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,560
Mr. Wei...

524

Take the evidence down.

Yes.

Everything in his home
was confiscated and sold.

528
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:50,150
Luckily, he didn't have any relatives.

529
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,040
Otherwise,

530
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,430
they'll be implicated.

We studied with the same teacher.

00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,840
I have a friendly reminder for you.

533

If you want to pursue a government career,

534
00:36:59,280 --> 00:36:59,910
from now on,

538
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,840
and had it tailored for himself.

539
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:26,320
You're about his size now.

540
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,190
I'm sure you can wear this.

541
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,630
Why would I wear it?

542
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,390
Although you threw away the notice
of the palace examination

543
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,280
sent by the Imperial Academy,

544
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,840
I can still find it.

545
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,280
I've checked with the Imperial Academy.

546
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,000
You didn't receive a Jinshi degree,

547

but

548
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,360
you're on the list
for the palace examination.

549
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:49,910
Do you know?

550
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,080
In the past, ten years as an official

551
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,760
might not even get one
to enter the palace.

552
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,600
But now, you can see the Empress.

553
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,470
I think

554
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,190
she arranged this on purpose.

555
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,430
Like you,

556
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,600
she loved to fight against fate.

557
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,910
You're young and reckless.

558
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,800
You think all the new is good and right.

559
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,560
But the "new"

560
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,630
means changes,

One word, "New".

00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:33,520
The palace examination takes two hours.

Candidates must concentrate
on their questions.

582

We should examine its purpose

and means.

584

Now, new policies have been enacted.

get a position or something.

for classicists.

What do you mean?

615

It means even if he becomes an official,
it'd be a minor one.
