[Judge Dee's Mystery]

2
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,980
[Based on the novel of the same name
by the Dutch author Robert van Gulik]

3
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,980
[This is a work of fiction.
Any resemblance is purely coincidental.]

4
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,200
Rent arrears

5
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,920
are just a small amount of money.

6
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,680
Why should Mr. Gu be disturbed?

7
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,400
That's very true, Commissioner.

8
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,560
It's just

9
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,280
that the cargo we found

10
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,880
is not a small deal.

11
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,840
It's the Modao.

12
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,280
Our Tang army's Modao

13
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,120
is well-hardened and extremely sharp.

14
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,080
By the Tang Code,

15
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,200
one can't keep them secretly
or sell them.

16
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,640
But the dockmaster confirms

17
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:18,800
that over the past six months,

18
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,440
there have been many shipments.

19
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,880
The shipment I found

20
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,480
included 100 Modao

21
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,480
and 80

22
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,680
Fuyuan Crossbows.

23
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,560
Mr. Gu,

24
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,520
I'd like to ask you,

25
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,640
where could an agent

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,080
sell such a large number

27
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,840
of weapons.

28
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,000
Since Wang Lide is at sea,

29
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,840
you should sail out to catch him.

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,840
Why come here to spoil
the Commissioner's fun?

31
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,920
I have already told you.

32
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,680
I've never hired such an agent.

33
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,080
Mr. Gu,

34
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,360
Magistrate Di said you hired that agent,

35
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,960
but where's the proof?

36
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,600
Miss Cao,

37
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,200
keep going.

38
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,680
Director Yi,

39
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,880
according to the Commission
of Maritime Trade's notice,

40
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,120
fifteen Gu's ships entered
and left the quay

41
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,920
last month.

42
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,920
There's a putty store at the quay.

43
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,240
According to their account book,

44
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,400
Gu's ships
that purchased putty last month

45
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,800
were more than 20.

46
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,640
Putty

47
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,200
is waterproof and seals leaks.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,560
Exactly.

49
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,840
That means the Gu family

50
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,360
has both legal ships

51
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,360
and clandestine ships.

52
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,560
I'm afraid

53
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,000
there are also legal
and clandestine agents.

54
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,040
Magistrate Di,

55
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,120
the Commission of Maritime Trade
manages the quay.

56
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,720
Each ship is charged a 10% tax.

57
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,400
You said there are legal ones
and clandestine ones.

58
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,320
You're accusing me
of dereliction of duty?

59
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,720
Magistrate Di said
that Wang Lide works for me,

60
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,120
but the ship isn't on the Commission
of Maritime Trade's notice,

61
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,440
so it means it's a ghost ship.

62
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,200
Mr. Gu,

63
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,560
if your agents sell swords
and crossbows,

64
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,000
that's treason.

65
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,800
I'm innocent.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,280
Please make a fair judgment.

67
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,360
Director Yi.

68
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,760
Magistrate Di alleges

69
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,320
that the Commission of Maritime Trade
is evading taxes.

70
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,000
This is no trivial matter.

71
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,000
I'll look into it when I get back.

72
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,680
I've just arrived in Penglai,

73
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,480
and I'm a little tired.

74
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,480
I think it would be best

75
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,280
to discuss this matter later.

76
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,840
Commissioner,

77
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,000
this is a very important case.

78
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,680
Can you ask Mr. Gu to stay here

79
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,320
so I can ask him thoroughly?

80
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,720
So do you mean

81
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,200
you're afraid that I'll protect them?

82
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,440
I wouldn't dare.

83
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,720
Tai, look.

84
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:23,840
Catch him!

85
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,320
Don't move.

86
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:24,840
Don't move.

87
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,640
Don't move.

88
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,160
Don't...

89
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,920
We're one of yours.

90
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,600
What are you doing?

91
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,320
- We're one of yours.
- We're on the same team.

92
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,400
- The same team.
- It's a misunderstanding.

93
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,320
It's a misunderstanding.

94
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,680
Magistrate!

95
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,400
Magistrate!

96
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,280
Help! Magistrate!

97
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,600
Magi...

98
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,840
Magistrate! Help!

99
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,800
Stop!

100
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,440
Magistrate.

101
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:43,960
Don't push.

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,680
Move back.

103
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,400
Magistrate Di,

104
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,800
your men?

105
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,240
They are indeed officers
of the Magistrate's Office.

106
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,760
And these are...

107
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,440
These are Mr. Gu...

108
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,080
Di Renjie,

109
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,200
you've come out of the blue
to set me up.

110
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,320
You want to accuse me of taking a bribe?

111
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,080
Commissioner,

112
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,320
I have no such intention.

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Step back.

114
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,720
Move back.

115
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,920
Di Renjie,

116
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,040
accept the imperial edict.

117
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,320
It's the Empress's

118
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,960
secret edict.

119
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,720
Di Renjie,

120
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,560
it's been found

121
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,160
that gold from Baekje has been flowing

122
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,960
into the capital
through Penglai recently.

123
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,400
Traitorous officials in the court

124
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,640
used it to buy people's support

125
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,640
and disrupt the market

126
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,840
with ill intention.

127
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,680
I order you to solve this case
within one month.

128
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,520
If you fail,

129
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,800
you'll be as guilty

130
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,480
as the gold smugglers.

131
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,400
Look. It's a ship.

132
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,080
Look over there.

133
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,560
- Look over there.
- A ship's coming.

134
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,600
There's no one on board.

135
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,640
Isn't this a ghost ship?

136
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,160
Let's go and take a look.

137
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,440
Ghost ship!

138
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,880
It's so strange.

139
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,160
This ship is going to crash into us.

140
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,800
Run!

141
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,920
Move aside.

142
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,680
Make way.

143
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,360
Hurry up.

144
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,240
Make way.

145
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,240
Search carefully.

146
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,320
There's nothing here.

147
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,040
Search this crate.

148
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,160
Coming.

149
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,960
Search carefully.

150
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,920
Open these crates

151
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,480
and find out what's inside.

152
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,440
Commissioner Liu was on a mission.

153
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,760
Last night,

154
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,160
it was clear
that he wanted to blackmail Mr. Gu

155
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,400
and Director Yi

156
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,440
for personal gain.

157
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,920
But what did you do?

158
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,600
You've spoiled his plan.

159
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,720
Last night was really an accident.

160
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,480
It would never be my intention.

161
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,640
I told you

162
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,040
to be careful.

163
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,080
The Empress trusts no one now.

164
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,840
If an official in the court
is suspected,

165
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,600
he'll be demoted or even exiled.

166
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,240
You can't cause any more trouble.

167
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,240
This isn't the time for you to show off
with high spirits.

168
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,030
Yes.

169
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,440
Director Yi,

170
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,440
did you find anything?

171
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,400
Commissioner Liu,

172
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,880
I'm on my way!

173
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,720
Commissioner Liu,

174
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,560
this ship

175
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,600
is very strange.

176
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,720
It's indeed a ghost ship.

177
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,680
Really? That's weird.

178
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,080
Did you check the cabin?

179
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,040
Yes, I did.

180
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,480
There were sailors in the cabin.

181
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,120
All the living essentials are there.

182
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,720
The kitchen...

183
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,720
There's rice and flour in the kitchen.

184
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,720
If the pirates attacked

185
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,880
and killed the crew,

186
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,360
there must be signs of struggle,

187
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,560
but there are no marks
of sword or knife fights.

188
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,240
Could it be that they jumped
into the sea together

189
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,640
after being frightened?

190
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,680
What about the cargo?

191
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,040
It's just furs and herbs.

192
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,520
It's not worth much.

193
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,360
Do you know

194
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,520
where did the cargo come from?

195
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,920
That's hard to say.

196
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,400
Tell me.

197
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,400
Mohe,

198
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,560
Baekje, Silla,

199
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,840
Tamna, and Wakoku

200
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,000
all produce these things.

201
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,080
Judging from the style of that ship,

202
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,880
it's clearly a Tang's vessel.

203
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,880
I grew up by the sea.

204
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,640
I can't be fooled.

205
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:56,720
Commissioner Liu,

206
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,320
I don't have this ship

207
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,360
in my fleet.

208
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,560
That's weird.

209
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,000
An unclaimed Tang vessel.

210
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,840
The sailors on board

211
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,760
have also disappeared.

212
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,680
Is it

213
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,840
really a ghost ship?

214
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,600
Come here.

215
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,320
Let me show you something.

216
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,360
Take a look.

217
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,320
Can you recognize it?

218
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,480
These are

219
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,000
just two pieces of gold.

220
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,200
What's the difference?

221
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:37,920
Diff...

222
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,080
One is placer gold.

223
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,480
The other

224
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,400
is Baekje gold.

225
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,840
Magistrate Di,

226
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,120
you're truly discerning.

227
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,560
Placer gold comes from rivers

228
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
and has impurities.

229
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,400
It's this one.

230
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,560
The other

231
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
is fine in color.

232
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,760
If it hasn't been purified,

233
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,720
it must come from the mountains.

234
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,920
It's said

235
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,400
there's a vein in Baekje

236
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,240
that produces gold

237
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,520
in the shape of broad beans.

238
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,200
So it's the other one.

239
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,400
Commissioner Liu, if you suspect

240
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,320
this ship

241
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,800
is involved in smuggling Baekje gold,

242
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,120
please allow me

243
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,720
to get on board and inspect it.

244
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,280
It's the Commission
of Maritime Trade's job

245
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,800
to inspect ships arrived at the quay.

246
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,400
When did

247
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,840
the Magistrate's Office take charge?

248
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,320
Deputy Secretary Hou,

249
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,440
what do you think?

250
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,760
Why don't you let him try?

251
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,080
If he can't find out anything,

252
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,960
it can dampen

253
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,960
my classmate's spirits a bit.

254
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,000
Thank you, Commissioner Liu

255
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,760
and Deputy Secretary Hou.

256
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,960
The Empress asked you
to investigate smuggling.

257
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,840
Director Yi and Mr. Gu

258
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,600
know about the Baekje gold

259
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,000
but are playing dumb.

260
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,640
You're the only one
who's trying to be brave.

261
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,200
Commissioner Liu came
with a secret edict.

262
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,600
How can I run away from it?

263
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,680
One's missing.

264
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,040
Maybe someone escaped with it.

265
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,000
Magistrate,

266
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,240
what's this for?

267
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,440
Such wood rollers

268
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,160
are used to move heavy objects on ships.

269
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,640
Look,

270
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,000
the crate was probably hanging there.

271
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,400
After being chopped off,

272
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,280
it fell down

273
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,840
and rolled over there.

274
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,440
It was here before.

275
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,840
I'm jotting it down.

276
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,520
Magistrate,

277
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,560
they brought mushrooms on board.

278
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,280
No.

279
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,840
These mushrooms grew on their own.

280
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,320
To grow to this size,

281
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
it would take at least 30 days.

282
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,520
After deducting the ten days
of the incident,

283
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:44,920
the ship

284
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,000
came to Penglai about 20 days ago.

285
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,320
If this ship set out 20 days ago,

286
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,160
its country of departure
shouldn't be Mohe

287
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,640
or Wakoku.

288
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,200
It should be

289
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,320
Tamna

290
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,200
or Baekje.

291
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,400
I've asked the fishermen.

292
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,400
Baekje.

293
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,800
Baekje gold.

294
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,040
Why is the rice bucket

295
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,480
in a place where the ceiling is leaking?

296
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,600
It's already moldy.

297
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,240
Give me a hand.

298
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,920
Qiao Tai,

299
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,480
save him.

300
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,600
Magistrate,

301
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,280
Miss Yusu is here.

302
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,000
Greetings, sirs.

303
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,840
As you were.

304
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,480
Please begin the questioning.

305
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,440
Who are you? Where are you from?

306
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,640
I'm from Baekje.

307
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,400
There've been wars for years.

308
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,280
I know how to make rice cake,

309
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,720
so I wanted to stow away
on the ship to Tang to sell it.

310
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,920
Then, my brother

311
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,800
secretly took me on board.

312
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,760
Since the crew was armed with swords,

313
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,680
he hid me under the cabin.

314
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,480
The ship changed direction a few times
during the voyage.

315
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,560
It was strange.

316
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,520
We came across

317
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,120
a white island we'd never seen before.

318
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,880
The ship was stopped there for a few days,
waiting for something.

319
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,760
On the night of the incident,

320
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,560
the ship stopped in a vast whirlpool.

321
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,520
I didn't know what happened that night,

322
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,560
but my brother told me not to come out.

323
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:47,720
I waited until the next day
but couldn't move the boards.

324
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,200
The next day,

325
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,400
he couldn't move the boards.

326
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,720
No one answered,
no matter how he shouted.

327
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,070
If you hadn't saved him,

328
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,160
he would've starved to death.

329
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,800
Ask him if he recognizes this man.

330
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,640
Have you seen the man in the portrait?

331
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,360
Magistrate Di,

332
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,920
don't be fooled by this Baekje man.

333
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,040
On the route from Baekje to Penglai,

334
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,320
there's no island.

335
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,800
This alone

336
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,240
could prove

337
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,960
that this thin guy is talking nonsense.

338
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,720
Either he's mad due to hunger,

339
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,280
or he's lying on purpose.

340
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,040
Nothing he said is credible.

341
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,200
A crew member

342
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,360
has a weird tattoo on his body.

343
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,480
What's he talking about?

344
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,400
My brother said
all the crew members had it.

345
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,640
He said

346
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,760
he saw a weird tattoo

347
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,280
on one of the crew members.

348
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,480
His brother said all the crew had it.

349
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,480
Draw it.

350
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,880
Draw the tattoo you see.

351
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,200
Heiyan

352
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,480
is back?

353
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:42,920
Yes.

354
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,880
Back then, you were too young

355
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,800
to know.

356
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,360
This group of remnants
of the former era was arrogant

357
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,840
and was all over the state.

358
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,400
They were a major threat
to the late Emperor.

359
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,440
Then what year was it...

360
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,280
In the 14th year of the Zhenguan Reign,

361
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,640
they were eliminated successfully,

362
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,920
basically wiped out.

363
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,240
The remaining ones

364
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,160
went into hiding.

365
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,600
Who had the credit
for that annihilation?

366
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,120
Magistrate Di,

367
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,880
your father, Di Zhixun,

368
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,120
made a great contribution.

369
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,360
Commissioner Liu,

370
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,120
Di Zhixun's case

371
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,480
has long been reversed.

372
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,400
And

373
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,800
there's no direct evidence

374
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,040
proving that he colluded with Heiyan.

375
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,240
Di Zhixun was threatened at the time,

376
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,960
so he chose to commit suicide.

377
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:44,960
But

378
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,280
as you said,

379
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,640
Heiyan has been in hiding
for many years,

380
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,240
but it's making a comeback.

381
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,440
Magistrate Di,

382
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,040
do you think they're the ones

383
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,400
smuggling Baekje gold?

384
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,880
The evidence we've collected

385
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,440
is not enough to conclude that.

386
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,440
Then why don't you go and investigate?

387
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,520
Yes.

388
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,520
Commissioner Liu
is a government official,

389
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,520
so the way he speaks...

390
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,520
Don't take it personally.

391
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,200
I know little

392
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,800
about the past,

393
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,880
so I don't mind talking about it.

394
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,600
I just didn't expect

395
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,320
Heiyan to be involved
in this big case again.

396
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,560
We annihilated them in the 14th year
of the Zhenguan Reign.

397
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,080
Today,

398
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,720
we can do the same.

399
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,040
With our combined efforts this time,

400
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,560
we're sure to make it.

401
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,320
There seems to be someone over there.

402
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,440
Let's go.

403
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,080
How are you doing?

404
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,520
Thank you.

405
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,480
It's the fifth meal.

406
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,880
This silly guy may eat too much.

407
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,080
He doesn't understand our language.

408
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,120
Anyway, Director Yi told us to feed him,

409
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,160
so why do you care so much?

410
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,560
Are you sure he choked to death?

411
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,360
I went to check when I got the news.

412
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,080
No poison was found

413
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,600
in the food he vomited.

414
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,040
A starving man

415
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,880
can't overeat like that.

416
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,440
Who told him to eat like that?

417
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,400
Yi Pan.

418
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,000
Magistrate.

419
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,000
Mr. Hong.

420
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,920
Someone drifted onto the beach.

421
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,760
It looks like a crew member
from the ghost ship.

422
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,920
Dead or alive?

423
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,840
Alive.

424
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,200
Report to Commissioner Liu
and Deputy Secretary Hou.

425
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,480
Hold court trial.

426
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,400
Magistrate,

427
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,400
this man stinks to high heaven.

428
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,960
[Jin Sang]
We've poured some water on him.

429
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:34,880
You may go.

430
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,240
Yes.

431
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,120
Are you from Baekje?

432
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,960
Sir,

433
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,280
please redress my grievances.

434
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,680
Are you from Baekje

435
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,880
or the Tang?

436
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,200
I'm from Baekje.

437
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,680
My name is Jin Sang.

438
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,760
My ancestors have been trading
with the Tang for generations,

439
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,480
so I can speak the language of the Tang.

440
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,320
In that case,

441
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,280
tell me about your ship.

442
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,120
It's that agent

443
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,720
with the surname Wang

444
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,680
killed all the sailors.

445
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,320
Do you recognize him?

446
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,400
I do.

447
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,560
I do. It's him.

448
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,840
Wang Lide.

449
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,560
Wang Lide.

450
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,240
I saw him commit murder,

451
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,280
and I ran away.

452
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,840
He chased me to the deck.

453
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,960
I had no choice

454
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,960
but to jump overboard.

455
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,240
What were you carrying
when you jumped overboard?

456
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,480
A plank.

457
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,680
Wasn't it a gourd?

458
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,520
No,

459
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,720
it was a plank.

460
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,360
I was lying on the plank like this.

461
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,160
Luckily, I had a fishing hook with me.

462
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,160
I fished

463
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,480
every day

464
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,840
to survive.

465
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,440
It's truly unbelievable

466
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,840
that you drifted at sea for ten days.

467
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,200
You're saying Wang Lide killed others.

468
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,680
What would be his motive?

469
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,080
I dare not say.

470
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,640
Why don't you dare?

471
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,000
I'm afraid of being beheaded.

472
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,040
Don't be scared.

473
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,520
Commissioner Liu is here.

474
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,800
He'll redress your grievances.

475
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,880
Then I'll tell you.

476
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,000
One day,

477
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,480
on the aft deck,

478
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,720
I overheard Wang Lide
plotting with others

479
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,400
about a large shipment of gold
being smuggled aboard the ship

480
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,480
in a big crate.

481
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,680
Wang Lide also said

482
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,960
that this gold shipment

483
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,800
is related to many big shots in Penglai.

484
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,040
One of them is...

485
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,680
Tell me!

486
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,000
One of them is...

487
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,920
the shipmaster, Mr. Gu.

488
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,600
He owns the ship.

489
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,080
Nonsense!

490
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,200
- There is also an official surnamed Yi.
- This is a frame-up!

491
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,520
You're a vicious slander!

492
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,680
The magistrate also received favors
from them.

493
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,080
I think his last name

494
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,040
is Di.

495
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,240
I'm the magistrate
whose last name is Di.

496
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,160
Tell me,

497
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,320
is your crew from Heiyan?

498
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,760
What Heiyan?

499
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,720
We're just ordinary sailors

500
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,920
recruited by Wang Lide

501
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,280
to support our families.

502
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,400
That's not right.

503
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,640
Someone said

504
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,880
he saw the symbol of Heiyan on you.

505
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,720
Where is it?

506
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,880
If you don't believe me,

507
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,920
take off my clothes.

508
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,680
Come on, I'll show you.

509
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,400
How improper!

510
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,160
Adjourn.

511
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,000
I'll take over

512
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,000
this case.

513
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,120
Sir.

514
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,120
Sir.

515
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,720
Sir.

516
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,560
Search carefully.

517
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,080
Don't let him get away.

518
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,960
Shh.

519
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,200
Stop.

520
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:44,680
You...

521
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,520
Mr. Heiyan?

522
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,920
You know me?

523
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,000
Last time in the forest...

524
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,680
Wait for us.

525
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,280
Lady,

526
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,440
you just have to do it the hard way.

527
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,360
It's you.

528
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,520
Do you have wine?

529
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,040
Yes.

530
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,800
Can you play a Bingzhou ditty?

531
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,320
I haven't learned it.

532
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,440
Just play something.

533
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,720
Keep playing.

534
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,280
I shouldn't

535
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,160
have said those two words, right?

536
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,480
You should learn the Bingzhou ditty.

537
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,600
Don't talk to me like that.

538
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,880
Get out of here.

539
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,720
Stay out of my sight.

540
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,280
Get out.

541
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,920
I'll be back.

542
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,080
Mr. Hong,

543
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,400
who is that guy?

544
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,240
He's someone Master doesn't like.

545
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,400
Your father is in the Heiyan.

546
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,440
He is a traitor.

547
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,160
Don't you dare say that again!

548
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,280
What's wrong with it?

549
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,360
Isn't that true?

550
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,440
Don't you dare badmouth my father?

551
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,760
I fell asleep.

552
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,600
It's only been half an hour.

553
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,640
I'm so sorry.

554
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,840
Magistrate, it's my honor

555
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,720
to share your worries.

556
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,440
Your songs

557
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,720
can always

558
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,920
calm my heart

559
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,600
and

560
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,880
clear my mind.

561
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,280
That's good.

562
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,400
This case

563
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,760
is a tough one.

564
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,520
Lately, officials working for the court
have gathered here.

565
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,800
I can always hear the horses
carrying messages

566
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,840
passing through the marketplace.

567
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,160
Even if I don't go out,

568
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,560
I can still feel
the ceaseless turmoil seething.

569
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,160
You must be

570
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,920
worried about this.

571
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,120
Nice tea.

572
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,560
Rumor has it

573
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,320
that a gang

574
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,240
called Heiyan

575
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,120
is behind this.

576
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,000
Whenever you play the pipa,

577
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,840
I'm pleasant.

578
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,240
I have some business to attend to.

579
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,600
Farewell.

580
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,920
Please take care.

581
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,320
Why did you take me here?

582
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,120
Qiao Tai found out

583
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,640
that the guards said the ship

584
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,040
was haunted.

585
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,680
Haunted?

586
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,960
So I asked you here
to catch a ghost with me.

587
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,000
Huaiying, don't be ridiculous.

588
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,520
Commissioner Liu tortured Jin Sang,

589
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,040
but the ruffian insisted

590
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,360
that everyone from the Commission
of Maritime Trade

591
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:50,920
and the Magistrate's Office

592
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,360
is related to the gold.

593
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,520
He said I'm also...

594
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,960
Do you believe it?

595
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,120
Also,

596
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,600
Jin Sang's and the thin guy's statements
are consistent.

597
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,880
They both mentioned the island.

598
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,560
But Gu Mengbin said

599
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,520
there is

600
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,520
no such island
in the waters near Penglai.

601
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:07,960
Magistrate,

602
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,800
please go back.

603
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,560
This ship is haunted.

604
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,680
That's right, Magistrate.

605
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,080
It's really haunted.

606
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:29,800
After you.

607
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,800
Guanshi!

608
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,960
This is the Star-Orienting Board.

609
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,440
It's used to measure the stars
on long voyages.

610
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,000
I know that.

611
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,440
They need it

612
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,920
to determine the course.

613
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,600
Commissioner,

614
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,360
this is the chart they used

615
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,120
to smuggle gold across the sea,

616
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,120
starting from Baekje

617
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,400
and ending at Penglai.

618
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,920
Look,

619
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,160
there's a small island here.

620
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,000
It matches the thin guy's
and Jin Sang's statements.

621
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,920
This island may be the key.

622
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,800
You mean

623
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,240
the gold is hidden on this island?

624
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,680
The top priority

625
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,400
is to go there as soon as possible
to check it out.

626
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,680
There's no time to lose.

627
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,760
Although Jin Sang talks nonsense

628
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,040
and has slandered Magistrate Di,

629
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,960
someone in Penglai

630
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,720
must have something to do with the gold.

631
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,160
If word gets out,

632
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,200
I'm afraid

633
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,840
someone else will get there first.

634
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,000
Commissioner,

635
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,360
the Commission of Maritime Trade
has sent two warships to escort you.

636
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,480
I'll be by your side

637
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,000
and serve you.

638
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,160
Take him on board.

639
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,400
Yes.

640
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,520
Move it.

641
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,800
I'm leaving.

642
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,040
If a lark wants to fly higher,

643
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,360
it must go farther.

644
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,800
Go outside and take a walk.

645
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,960
Stuck in this cage,

646
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,720
you could only be a plaything.

647
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,640
Miss Cao An,

648
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,280
I'll see you again.

649
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,360
Are you looking for someone?

650
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,120
What are you doing here?

651
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,600
Commissioner Liu is going out to sea.

652
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,360
He wants you to sing on his ship.

653
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,880
It may be a risky trip.

654
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,760
Remember,

655
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,800
don't get on board.

656
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,800
Why do you say that?

657
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,680
Heiyan.

658
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,440
Find an excuse.

659
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,160
Don't get on board.

660
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,280
Don't get on board.

661
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,960
Thank you for reminding me.

662
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,280
How's it going?

663
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,080
It's red.

664
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:49,800
That's right.

665
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,320
Remember what the chart says?

666
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,000
When we're 50 li from Penglai

667
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,280
and sink ten zhang,

668
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,120
the sea mud will turn red.

669
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,720
So,

670
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,400
we're on the route
Wang Lide was once on.

671
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:03,880
We'll reach the island

672
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,520
in one day.

673
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,640
Attention, everybody!

674
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,160
A storm is coming.

675
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,480
Secure everything on board.

676
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,720
Tighten the ropes.

677
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,400
Lower the sails now.

678
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,460
Magistrate, it's dangerous out there.

679
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,840
Let's go inside.

680
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,240
Hurry up.

681
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,100
Miss Yusu,

682
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:56,780
what's wrong?

683
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,800
Miss Yusu,

684
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,960
are you all right?

685
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,440
Miss Yusu.

686
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,760
Ma Rong, come and help.

687
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,400
Commissioner Liu invites you two ladies

688
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,920
to sing a song upstairs.
