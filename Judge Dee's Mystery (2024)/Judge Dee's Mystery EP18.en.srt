00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,280
So his target is you.

6
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,600
I'll kill him.

7
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,040
Are you ready?

8
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,760
The Lone Wolf Gang

9
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,040
still has some evil members left.

10
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,640
Go to hell and meet your leader.

11
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,800
I heard that

12
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,280
there was a new magistrate in Lan Ward.

13
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,440
Compared to those good-for-nothings,

14
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,880
you do have some abilities.

15
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,920
I repeat my words.

16
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,480
You can't take

17
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,320
that Anhua.

18
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,360
Now, what do you have to say?

19
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,880
Today,

20
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,080
you saved my life.

21
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,680
I will spare you once.

22
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,190
But as for Anhua, I must take it.

23
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,160
Of course, whether I can take the Anhua

24
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,840
depends on whether you can find
the real culprit.

25
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
Whoever you investigate,

26
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,920
I will kill.

27
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,440
Remember,

28
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,600
this place is Lan Ward.

29
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,800

Where is Qiu Yue?

35
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,440
Magistrate,

36
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,360
tonight, everyone in the Red Pavilion

37
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,400
is looking for Qiu Yue.

38
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,240
Why don't you ask them

39
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,840
if they have found her?

00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,980
[Red Pavilion]

41
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,120
Magistrate,

42
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,720
she has skipped.

43
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,240
All valuable things are gone.

45
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,400
Madam.

46
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,040
Are you still looking for Qiu Yue?

47
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,800
Where is she?

48
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,480
Do you know where she went?

49
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,070
A couple of days ago, she was so restless

50
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,120
because of the death of Mr. Li.

51
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,000
I thought

52
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,720
she was resting in her room
as she asked for leave.

53
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,680
I didn't expect that

54
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,400
she would run away.

55
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,000
As long as she left the Red Pavilion,

56
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,280
live or die,

57
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,680
it's her own business.

58
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,560
You really don't know?

59
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,000
I really don't know

60
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,440
where she went.

61
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,640
Outside the Lan Ward,

62
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,360

This is Zhenxi Fortress.

Zhenxi Fortress is at the border of Tang.

68
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,280
From there, you can leave the Tang land.

69
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,080
If Qiu Yue really killed Mr. Li,

70
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,560
she would definitely flee the empire.

71
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,720
That makes sense.

72
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,000
Qiu Yue is frail and may not ride a horse.

73
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,160
If she took a carriage,

74
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,240
as the way is long,

75
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,240
she must resupply at the Liuli Post.

76
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,560
I'll arrange for some men

77
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,080
to chase her.

78
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,200
I'll do it now.

00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,920
I've said it all along,

81
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,760
Qiu Yue is the culprit.

82
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,760
Now, she has run away.

83
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,000

84
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,640

85

Isn't it Qiu Yue's hair stick?

117
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,760
Was she dragged away from here?

118
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,560
But here, it shows no traces of dragging.

119
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,520
Wrong.

120
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,000

Why is that?

123
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,440

this golden hair stick

193
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,920
was put in that cellar

194
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,040
by your workers, right?

195
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,480
Miss Biyu,

196
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,880
are you aware that

197
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,680
though this scheme is ingenious,

198
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,600
it has one critical flaw?

199
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,880
The flags you left in the Hongliu Village

200
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,360
belong to the Black Tiger Gang.

201
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,600
Black Tiger Gang

202
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,000
loves killing.

203
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,160
Qian Hao

204
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,640
treats human lives like grass.

205
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,440
If he was to find Qiu Yue,

206
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,000
he must kill some people.

207
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,720
Right?

208
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,440
But when I arrived in Hongliu Village,

209
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,160
the whole village

210
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,040
was empty.

211
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,680
Did the Black Tiger Gang become kind

212
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,280
and tell the villagers to leave

213
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,840
before they came to kidnap Qiu Yue?

214
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,160
Your plot is ingenious.

215
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,760
Whoever

216
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,680
finds the golden hair stick

217
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,760
would believe that

218
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,440
Qiu Yue

219
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,600
has been kidnapped.

220
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,120
But why it is that, up to now,

221
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,280
nobody

222
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,160
takes Qiu Yue

223
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,320
to see Governor Li and claim his Anhua?

224
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,960
If my guess is correct,

225
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,000
Qiu Yue

226
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,360
didn't leave Lan Ward at all.

227
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,800
She is still

228
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,320
in the city.

229
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,280
Tell me,

230
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,800
where is she?

231
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,440
I don't know.

232
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,560
Miss Biyu,

233
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,680
could you believe me for just once?

234
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,840
Qiu Yue is in great danger.

235
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,920
I don't know.

236
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,520
All gangs in the city

237
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,800
took the Anhua

238
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,680
and searched the entire Lan Ward,

239
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,760
but they still didn't find a trace

240
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,360
of Qiu Yue leaving the city.

241
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,360
They searched everywhere.

242
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,160
Qiu Yue might not have left the city.

243
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,200
Perhaps

244
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,000
she is still in the Red Pavilion.

245
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,480
Then we should tear down the Red Pavilion.

246
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,600
She killed my son

247
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,720
and wants to hide.

248
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,000
If she makes me lose control,

249
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,880
I'll have everyone at the Red Pavilion

250
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,120
buried with my son.

251
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,840
Understood.

252
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,680
Things not going smoothly?

253
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,240
I didn't find Qiu Yue.

254
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,720
Biyu knows where she is,

255
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,640
but she won't admit it.

256
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,960
Give her some time.

257
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,320
Are you sure

258
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,960
that Qiu Yue is the culprit?

259
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,120
No.

260
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,480
Li Tao committing suicide

261
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,600
makes no sense.

262
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,280
Qiu Yue

263
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,640
is the prime suspect
for imitating Biyu in committing murder.

264
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,320
But now,

265
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,040
Governor Li has offered Anhua.

266
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,520
All forces in Lan Ward want to kill her.

267
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,390
Qiu Yue

268
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,760
faces imminent danger.

269
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,000
Is there any other suspect?

270
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,680
I have excluded the possibility

271
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,390
that a thief broke in through the window

272
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,320
to steal promissory notes and kill him.

273
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,870
The last person to enter Li Tao's room

274
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,110
was Qiu Yue.

275
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,560
Qiu Yue said that

276
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,080
when she entered the room,

277
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,960
Li Tao was already dead.

278
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,520
Li Tao once told her

279
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,640
he

280
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,240
was writing a will.

281
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,040
To prove that she is innocent,

282
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,760
she searched Li Tao's belongings

283
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,560
to find the will.

284
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,400
That explains

285
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,120
why Li Tao's body

286
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
was moved by someone

287
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,440
and his room was messy.

288
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,440
But the point is

289
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,320
the will

290
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,120
hasn't been found by Qiu Yue.

291
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,680
I haven't found it, either.

292
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,840
The only evidence

293
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,480
that can prove Qiu Yue's innocence

294
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,680
is gone.

295
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,160
Qiu Yue said that

296
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,760
Li Tao loved her deeply,

297
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,360
and so did she.

298
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,760
If so,

299
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,400
Qiu Yue

300
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,240
didn't have a reason to kill Li Tao.

301
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,720
He was nice,

302
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,880
gentle,

303
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,720
and kind.

304
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,360
... like a lotus under the sunshine.

305
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,440
From Qiu Yue's words

306
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,240
and tone,

307
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,520
I can see that

308
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,840
she is indeed in love with Li Tao.

309
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,480
Magistrate, have you ever thought that

310
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,200
perhaps

311
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,800
it is really a suicide.

312
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,240
You have excluded the possibility

313
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,640
that someone broke in and killed him.

314
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,280
Yes.

315
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,360
Li Tao loved Qiu Yue,

316
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
and it is for sure.

317
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,040
Yes.

318
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,160
Qiu Yue loves Li Tao,

319
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,560
and you do believe it.

320
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,160
Yes.

321
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,880
They love each other,

322
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,320
but due to some unspeakable reason,

323
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,440
they can't stay with each other.

324
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,640
So, Li Tao

325
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,240
had no choice but to commit suicide.

326
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,120
Is this story

327
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,920
not reasonable?

328
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,040
When you exclude all the possibilities,

329
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,960
the remaining ones,

330
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,800
however unbelievable,

331
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,080
are the truth.

332
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,000
Mister.

333
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,360
Get out!

334
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,200
You get out!

335
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,160
What's the matter?

336
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,320
Mister.

337
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,080
Magistrate,

338
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,520
Mr. Hu woke up.

339
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,680
I'll go there.

340
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:29,840
Let's go.

341
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,960
Thanks, Miss Cao.

342
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,200
You've finally come.

343
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,240
Look at this.

344
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,960
He keeps drawing things.

345
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,800
These are messy.

346
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,640
He also keeps mumbling something.

347
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,880
But I don't know what he is saying.

348
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,880
That's it!

349
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
I finally got the drawing right.

350
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,440
That's it!

351
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,520
Burn!

352
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,080
Burn.

353
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,600
Burn.

354
00:22:59,280 --> 00:22:59,680
Burn.

355
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,920
I must burn them all.

356
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,440
Is that you who burnt

357
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,240
Li Tao's corpse?

358
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,160
Burn it all and leave nothing.

359
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,880
We can't let it scourge the world.

360
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,320
Burn!

361
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,720
What will scourge the world?

362
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,920
It.

363
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,120
Sand flea.

364
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,040
It bites man.

365
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,680
It bites man to pieces.

366
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,160
It's more horrible than tuberculosis.

367
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:21,960
Burn!

368
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:22,800
Burn!

369
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,440
Burn!

370
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,720
Burn!

371
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,200
Burn!

372
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:25,840
Burn!

373
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,680
Burn!

374
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,920
Help!

375
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,840
Fortunately, I burned it.

376
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,800
The red spot on Li Tao's body

377
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,480
was caused by sand fleas.

378
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,080
He was not poisoned.

379
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:39,800
Right.

380
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,840
I don't have time

381
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,120
to wait for your justice.

382
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,520
He told me

383
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,760
he was writing a will to me.

384
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,120
I thought he was joking with me.

385
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,200
Whoever kills the murderer

386
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,360
doesn't matter.

387
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,760
Magistrate Di.

388
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,880
Governor Li  found Qiu Yue
at the Red Pavilion.

389
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,840
Miss Biyu urges you to go there quickly.

390
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,640
Governor Li!

391
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,200
- I'll kill you!
- Spare her!

392
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,520
Stop there!

393
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,080
Magistrate Di,

394
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,280
are you going to stop me?

395
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,040
Qiu Yue

396
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,920
is not the murderer.

397
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,800
This girl

398
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,760
seduced my son

399
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,480
and played with my son's feelings.

400
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,680
To raise her own social status,

401
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,960
she even took my son's life.

402
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,680
Today,

403
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,560
I'll kill her at this place

404
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,880
to mourn for my son.

405
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,200
Miss Qiu Yue,

406
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,640
do you know that

407
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:53,840
Li Tao

408
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,840
truly committed suicide?

409
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:57,960
What's more,

410
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,040
he committed suicide for you.

411
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,720
Liar!

412
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,400
You are lying!

413
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,480
How could you

414
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,040
humiliate my son

415
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,280
just to absolve this girl?

416
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,280
Governor Li!

417
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,480
I would like

418
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,080
to go bail for her with my life.

419
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,800
Your son

420
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,720
truly committed suicide.

421
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,840
Nonsense!

422
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,880
That's nonsense!

423
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,440
Why would my son kill himself?

424
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,120
Why would he?

425
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,280
He had a bright future.

426
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,520
He was only 25.

427
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,200
How would he

428
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,160
commit suicide for this prostitute?

429
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,960
Because he suffered

430
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,160
from a terminal illness like you.

431
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:58,880
Impossible.

432
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,000
Impossible!

433
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,560
Get out of here!

434
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,440
You are not my son!

435
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,680
Father.

436
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,200
After I knew I fell ill,

437
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,640
I at once expelled him
and sent him to Lan Ward.

438
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,920
How could he

439
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,360
be infected by me?

440
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,440
Because Li Tao was not suffering
from tuberculosis.

441
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,440
Neither do you.

442
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,320
Governor Li,

443
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,960
your illness

444
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,160
was caused by sand fleas.

445
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,480
Sand fleas

446
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,080
are very poisonous.

447
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,720
After being bitten by sand fleas,

448
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,960
people will fall ill.

449
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,280
At the beginning, people feel itchy.

450
00:26:59,040 --> 00:26:59,520
Then,

451
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,280
the body begins to fester

452
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,000
until the bones are shown.

453
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,440
The patients

454
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,600
will suffer from endless pain

455
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,800
until

456
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,120
they die.

457
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,520
Also,

458
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,600
it's incurable by medicine.

459
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,960
Do you remember

460
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,640
the flowers you cultivated?

461
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,240
It was those tulips

462
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,560
that attracted the sand fleas.

463
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,960
Your son

464
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,600
didn't know what kind of disease he had,

465
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,040
but he knew

466
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,800
his body

467
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,040
had a great problem.

468
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,960
That was why

469
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,280
he had changed his attitude

470
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,240
toward you suddenly.

471
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,400
He scolded you deliberately

472
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,880
and avoided you intentionally.

473
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,000
Mister.

474
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,080
Get out!

475
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,160
You get out!

476
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:06,640
Mister.

477
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,440
Get out!

478
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,720
Mister.

479
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,800
He didn't want his beloved girl

480
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,640
to have any feelings for him.

481
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,520
Mister.

482
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,480
Don't come over.

483
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,680
Mister.

484
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,640
Don't come over.

485
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,160
You once told me that

486
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,880
when Li Tao

487
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,440
first came to the Red Pavilion,

488
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,440
you took desserts to him,

489
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,320
and you two

490
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,920
fell in love at first sight.

491
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,040
Mr. Li

492
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,480
was refined and courteous.

493
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,160
He was generous and benevolent.

494
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,800
He was good in every aspect.

495
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,480
He and you

496
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,320
developed an affection for each other
after staying together for long.

497
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,680
On that day,

498
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,640
he finally confessed to you

499
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,280
and proposed to you.

500
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,760
Governor Li,

501
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,440
all of these

502
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,600
can be testified by everyone here.

503
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,520
Right. That's right.

504
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Miss Qiu Yue,

505
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,480
the reason why you denied his proposal

506
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,160
was that you saw the evil
of human nature when you were little

507
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,480
and you didn't believe that

508
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,840
in this world,

509
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,360
you could encounter

510
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,880
such wonderful things.

511
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,960
You were afraid.

512
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,640
You feared all of these

513
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,760
were not true.

514
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,360
You dared not believe that.

515
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,000
So,

516
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,720
you shrank back.

517
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,760
Qiu Yue,

518
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,320
I believe you.

519
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,280
Li Tao

520
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,280
had indeed written that will.

521
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,040
Maybe he didn't know

522
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,800
why you would shrink back.

523
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,720
But he loved you.

524
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,000
That is true.

525
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,240
Don't blame him for what he did
to you afterward.

526
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,840
That must not be

527
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,800
his true intentions.

528
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,680
In the midst of a flowing stream,

529
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,800
my heart is unspeakable to you.

530
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,160
Pitifully,

531
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,640
I didn't find the will, either.

532
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,280
Perhaps,

533
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,800
just as you said,

534
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,600
the will

535
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,160
was most probably

536
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,040
blown away

537
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,160
by a gust of wind.

538
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,920
He really wrote a will for me.

539
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,480
Governor Li,

540
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,720
the man who pushed your son to death

541
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,840
is you,

542
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,960
not Qiu Yue.

543
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,680
Miss Qiu Yue,

544
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,960
I am so ashamed.

545
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,040
I lost my courtesy.

546
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,080
I would like to apologize

547
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,520
for my offense.

548
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,560
Di Renjie,

549
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,480
Magistrate Di,

550
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,520
thanks for clarifying all of this.

551
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,880
I really have become senile.

552
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,080
Thank you for what you did.

553
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,360
You saved Miss Qiu Yue

554
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,200
and told me my son's

555
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,360
last will.

556
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,160
I am

557
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,760
deeply touched.

558
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,320
You are a beautiful girl.

559
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,480
No wonder my son loved you so much.

560
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,720
I have no other way to show my apology.

561
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,320
If there were another life,

562
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,240
I would surely repay you generously.

563
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,680
Magistrate,

564
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,760
please allow me to die with dignity.

00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,200
Yeah. It's really beautiful.

582
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,680
Please take us there.

583
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,640
Okay. Let's go.

584
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,520
Set out!

585
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,560
Di Renjie,

586
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,600
I still challenge you!

587
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,680
Have you ever

588
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,600
recollected that girl

589
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,840
whom you deceived?

590
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,960
That girl who hung herself.

591
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,760
Strangled by the rope. How does it feel?

592
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,520
Bit by bit...

593
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,440
Bit by bit...

594
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,360
The blood flows down.

595
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,840
Pain

596
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,320
is far from over.

597
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,720
The wheel of karma turns.

598
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,680
What goes around comes around.

599
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,760
This is the natural law.
