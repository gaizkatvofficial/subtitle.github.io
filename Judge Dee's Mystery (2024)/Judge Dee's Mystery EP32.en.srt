195
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,400
Li Miao.

196
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,680
Flesh and blood.
Let the Lord live forever.

197
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,480
Conquering demons.

198
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,040
Possessing the mixed brilliance.

199
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,040
Why are you screwing with me?

200
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,600
I've been waiting
for this day for decades.

201
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,880
Why are you back?

202
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,240
Where is Cao An?

203
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,360
Why do you force me to kill you?

204
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,080
Why are you meddling?

205
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,280
Since some people have chosen to be evil,

206
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,360
some others will choose to be good.

207
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,280
Hypocritical. A group of hypocrites!

208
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,060
[Shen Wei]

209
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,040
Magistrate Di, I beg you.

210
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,000
I have no time now.

211
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,720
I need this child.

212
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,680
I need to offer his blood

213
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,000
to my god.

214
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,080
Where is Cao An?

215
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,360
I won't kill her.

216
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,680
As long as I can finish the sacrifice,

217
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,440
I'll release her.

218
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,760
Where is she?

219
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,240
If you get in my way,

220
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,520
Miss Cao will die.

221
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,960
Wait and see.

222
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,120
You have no time.

223
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,080
You will see with your own eyes
your eternal life

224
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,960
ends in smoke.

225
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,560
I have no time indeed.

226
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,120
But do you think you have time?

227
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,960
She will die

228
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
before me.

229
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,800
Before me!

230
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,880
Where are you hiding her?

231
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,120
I can tell you where I'm hiding her.

232
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,680
There.

233
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,680
No.

234
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,480
There.

235
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,680
There.

236
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,000
She is in a place

237
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,440
you can never find.

238
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,920
She will slowly savor
the horror before death.

239
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,400
I tell you, Di Renjie.

240
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,760
In order to keep you alive,

241
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,960
Miss Cao is willing to stay.

242
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,120
What about you?

243
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,680
You ignored her

244
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,600
for an irrelevant child.

245
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,440
Where is Cao An?

246
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,000
Where is she?

247
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,520
No.

248
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,840
There.

249
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,560
She is in a place

250
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,160
you can never find.

251
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,920
Where is she?

252
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,720
Tell me.

Tai.

257
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,120
It's okay.

258
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,440
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

259
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,440
We are not bad people.

260
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,640
Is your name Wei Xiaobao?

261
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,080
I know your grandmother.

262
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,120
Come, I'll take you out of here.

263
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,600
Cao An!

264
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,160
Cao An!

265
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:40,920
Cao An.

266
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,920
Cao An.

267
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,440
Magistrate.

268
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,440
Magistrate, step aside. Let me do it.

269
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,080
You came at last.

270
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,480
I would definitely come.

271
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,800
I know you have a lot of questions.

272
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,720
It all started

273
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,120
when I found the little wooden sword.

274
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,320
The moment I saw the little wooden sword,

275
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,680
I suddenly realized

276
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,480
Zhou Li was trying to tell me something.

277
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:45,880
Later on,

278
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,680
I found Xiaobao

279
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,960
in a corner.

280
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,880
Don't be afraid.

281
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,680
Xiaobao told me

282
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,520
Li Miao was a bad guy,

283
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,600
who wanted to kill him.

284
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,640
Zhou Li saved him.

285
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,240
Xiaobao.

286
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,200
Don't be afraid.

287
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,360
My name is Zhou Li.

288
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,160
I'll get you out of here.

289
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,480
Come out.

290
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,200
Come.

291
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,000
Xiaobao, are you okay?

292
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,160
Then Zhou Li

293
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,920
brought Xiaobao to Mr. Cui's room.

294
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,400
We happened to be there.

295
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,160
Zhou Li was a man of delicate mind.

296
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,960
Carrying Xiaobao,

297
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,720
he deliberately walked backwards

298
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,440
to our door.

299
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,400
Finally,

300
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,080
he kept throwing snow balls at our door.

301
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,000
He wanted me to leave.

302
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,920
Hearing the noise,

303
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,440
I went out to see.

304
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,640
At that time, Xiaobao went into our room.

305
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,200
Xiaobao left the incense

306
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,240
we gave to Mr. Cui at our door

307
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,560
so that we could see Li Miao

308
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,800
for what he really was
as soon as possible.

309
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,840
Did he take the medicine

310
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,160
I decocted for him?

311
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,600
I accidentally knocked it over.

312
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,320
Then I decided to take Xiaobao away

313
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,160
because I thought Li Miao

314
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,720
must have found something.

315
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,920
I figured out a way.

316
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,040
Sell the dummy.

317
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,120
He must be affected
by the Yin Qi at the altar.

318
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,800
We must leave here immediately.

00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:45,740
[Zhao Yun Library]

320
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,680
When Li Miao and the others
were seeing us off,

321
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,200
Xiaobao took the opportunity to flee.

322
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,360
We agreed to meet
at the foot of the mountain.

323
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,760
But when I arrived there,

324
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,800
I didn't see Xiaobao.

325
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,240

326
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,920
Xiaobao.

327
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,120
Those who came

328
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,160
were Li Miao's disciples.

329
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,320
They had taken Xiaobao back.

330
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,800
He is an official appointed by the court.

331
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,200
If you kill him,

332
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,200
you will be sentenced to death.

334
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,200
Would I care about that?

335
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,960
Don't you believe in the will of heaven?

336
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,800
You are about to have an eternal life.

337
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,040
Your life will be as long as heaven.

338
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,000
Why not let his fate

339
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,760
be decided by heaven?

340
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,840
If he can survive,

00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,840
that's his fate.

[The axle is broken. I'll go seek help.]

A year ago,

347
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,280
Li Miao and his men took over this place.

348
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,120
They killed Mr. Cui and his disciples.

349
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,280
He continued to recruit students

under the name of the library.

351
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,720
In Li Miao's eyes,

352
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,320
they were all sacrifices.

353
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,320
In order to live forever,
he killed numerous people.

Zhou Li

355
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,480
couldn't bear

00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,320
he ended his life

in that way.

360
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,880

00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,800
to send us a warning in this way.

385
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,560
Xiaobao.

386
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,640
Come, my child.

387
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,880
- Thank you for your great kindness.
- Thank you, Magistrate.

388
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,280
Madam, you are welcome.

389
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,560
Get up.

390
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,600
Come on, Xiaobao.

391
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,960
Get up.

392
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,040
Xiaobao.

393
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,760
Xiaobao,

394
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,520
take your grandmother...

395
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,240
Xiaobao.

396
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,800
Go home.

397
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,600
Xiaobao,

398
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,240
let's go home.

399
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,160
Go home.

400
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,040
Where is my sword?

401
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,880
It's time to give it back to me.

402
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,760
Now that you've saved me,

403
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,360
I'll give it to you.

404
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,920
Time to go.

405
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,760
Time to go, my child.

406
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,960
Let's go home.

407
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,920
Go home.

408
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,560
Everybody has a good heart

409
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,640
because they care about someone

410
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,720
in their heart.

411
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,120
The only way to live forever

412
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,520
is to live

413
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,520
in the memory of your relatives.

414
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,360
Hong.

415
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,320
Hong.

416
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,480
Can't a killer

417
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,320
get away with murder?
