5
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,600
Quick! Lower the sails.

6
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,880
Lower the sails.

7
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,480
Harder.

8
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,470
Watch out.

9
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,760
Get out of the way.

10
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,880
Get out of the way.

11
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,560
Someone's fallen into the sea!

12
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,960
Help!

13
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,920
Hurry up.

14
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,560
We got into a trouble, Mr. Gu.

15
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,920
The rudder's been sabotaged.

16
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,240
We have a mole.

17
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,080
Hong Liang,

18
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,960
this is our first day at sea.

19
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,360
If anything happens to us,

20
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,600
present this letter to the court

21
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,200
as proof

22
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,680
to let the truth be known.

23
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,560
Last night,

24
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,080
it was stormy.

25
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,360
We have an evildoer on board

26
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,960
who destroyed the mast and the rudder.

27
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,470
But we don't know

28
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,720
who the evildoer is or why he keeps us

29
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,200
stranded at sea.

30
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,960
We've been separated from the fleet.

31
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,400
Last night,

32
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,760
we searched the ship

33
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,400
and decided

34
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,120
to consider it today.

35
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,680
You're being so calm.

36
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,560
I'm trying to help you
reassure the people.

37
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,680
There's plenty of water and food on board.

38
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,000
Help will eventually come in a few days.

39
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,640
As long as we don't lose our footing,

40
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,160
the evildoer on the ship

41
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,600
will be ferreted out.

42
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,760
That's true.

43
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,720
That piece just now.

44
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,240
I've never heard you play it before.

45
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,840
It's a new work by Hu Erniang
in the capital.

46
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,800
It's just with a new notation

47
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,000
that makes it easier to copy.

48
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,560
What did Hong Liang bring you?

49
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,320
What a big box.

50
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,000
Do you still have to deal with paperwork
on the sea?

51
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,120
It's the new clues

52
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,480
I've found in the past few days.

53
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,320
And some old books I found

54
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,840
in the library at the magistral office.

55
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,160
I read some of them yesterday.

56
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,440
They're quite useful.

57
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,520
Going out for a walk?

58
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,120
Sure.

59
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,560
It's just a precautionary measure.

60
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,720
Unexpectedly,

61
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,280
it comes in handy.

62
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,720
Can this pigeon

63
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,840
really deliver messages?

64
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,320
Sir,

65
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,520
when it gets dark,

66
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,720
we can determine the ship's position.

67
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,680
Magistrate Di,

68
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,200
please use the pigeon to tell the shore

69
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,960
to rescue us as soon as possible.

70
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,920
Where are you going?

71
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Ms. Cao is seasick.

72
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,800
I'm going to the front cabin
to get some water.

73
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,600
Get some water?

74
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,160
Not a problem.

75
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,560
Sing us a song.

76
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,960
Yes, sing us a song.

77
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,040
Let me go.

78
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,880
Is this what you do as the Yulin Guards?

79
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,320
Mind your own business.

80
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,200
You pawn. You're dead.

81
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,640
Deputy Secretary Hou is coming.

82
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:48,920
Let's go.

83
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:49,960
Let's go...

84
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,200
Are you okay?

85
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,960
I'm okay.

86
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,520
Thank you.

87
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,360
What do you have in mind?

88
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,560
Wang Lide's chart.

89
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,800
So do I.

90
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,440
Don't you think

91
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,520
something is missing on the chart?

92
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,080
Wherever Wang Lide goes,

93
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,520
he'd observe the stars

94
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,080
and check with the marks on the chart

95
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,800
to avoid going off course.

96
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,560
On the night of the incident,

97
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,120
according to the thin guy,

98
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,920
Wang Lide anchored his ship somewhere.

99
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,440
If he was waiting for someone,

100
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,880
there must be a mark on his chart.

101
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,360
That's right.

102
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,800
But the chart we found

103
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,400
doesn't have it.

104
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,920
You did work for
the Ministry of Punishments.

105
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,880
Right on the nose.

106
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,800
How do we find the missing mark?

107
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,240
Deputy Secretary Hou and Magistrate Di,

108
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,880
Commissioner Liu has summoned you
to the cabin.

109
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,600
- Commissioner Liu.
- Commissioner Liu.

110
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,480
Sit.

111
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,000
Bring Jin Sang up here.

112
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,280
Go.

113
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:21,960
Go.

114
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,160
I've been in the palace all my life,

115
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,640
but I'm not stupid.

116
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,760
I slept on this ship last night.

117
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,360
As the waves crashed,

118
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,880
I remembered my fishing skills

119
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,560
from childhood.

120
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,320
Commissioner Liu,

121
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,120
having gained Her Majesty's high favor,

122
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,400
you must have been gifted since childhood.

123
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,280
When a big fish takes the bait,

124
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,400
you have to use a harpoon.

125
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,520
You do it fast and hard.

126
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,360
Frankly,

127
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,360
I'm taking you to sea

128
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,680
because I've got Wang Lide's chart.

129
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,200
It's strange.

130
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,280
As soon as we set sail,

131
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,520
someone sabotaged the sails.

132
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,120
What's he afraid of?

133
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,240
I've been thinking about it.

134
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,520
I think he's afraid

135
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,600
that the gold could be found.

136
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,760
Or he's afraid

137
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,880
that I'll find out

138
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,840
who's

139
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,400
smuggling the gold.

140
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,520
This Baekje gold

141
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,400
has been flowing into the capital
for quite some time.

142
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,440
Such an attractive treasure,

143
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,960
passing through Penglai,

144
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,520
it's impossible that no one gets involved.

145
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,560
Coincidentally,

146
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,960
the Director of Maritime Trade, Mr. Gu,

147
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,160
and the magistral officer,

148
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,840
all the dignitaries of Penglai

149
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,720
are on board.

150
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,480
There are also two talented singers

151
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,040
who can play good tunes.

152
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,840
Do any of you know

153
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,120
where Wang Lide and the gold are?

154
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,670
Sir, you went to all that trouble
for this voyage,

155
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,520
so I should do anything.

156
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,640
But I really don't know

157
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,400
where Wang Lide and the gold are.

158
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,280
Neither do your men?

159
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,160
Commissioner Liu,

160
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,840
I'm just an agent under Mr. Gu.

161
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,440
I've always obeyed the law

162
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,880
and never seen Wang Lide or the gold.

163
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,480
But as far as I know,

164
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,320
this Baekje singer

165
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,280
was recommended by you.

166
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,000
Magistrate Di found a Baekje man

167
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,600
on the ship that day,

168
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,840
so I asked Ms. Yusu to interpret.

169
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,920
It seems

170
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,360
you've remembered something else.

171
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,440
Sir.

172
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,920
Sir.

173
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,120
Back on the ship last night,

174
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,400
it was as if I had gone back to

175
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,800
half a month ago.

176
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,400
I seem to remember something.

177
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,520
What is it?

178
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,360
Sir,

179
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,480
one time,

180
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,160
Wang Lide drank and boasted to others

181
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,640
that he had a lover ashore

182
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,320
who is a singer.

183
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,960
Open your eyes and take a look.

184
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,040
There are two singers here.

185
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,800
Which one is it?

186
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,680
Sir,

187
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,960
I haven't seen her with my own eyes,

188
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,040
so I can't recognize.

189
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,200
However,

190
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,880
Wang Lide once said

191
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,760
that the singer

192
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,760
is a Baekje.

193
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,920
It seems to get foggy ahead.

194
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,160
Yes, it is.

195
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,200
It's getting heavier.

196
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,360
Report it now.

197
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,480
Watch out.

198
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,960
- It's getting foggy.
- It's getting foggy.

199
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,120
It's getting foggy.

200
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,240
Hurry up.

201
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,440
Get back to the cabin.

202
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,080
Back to the cabin...

203
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,080
Hurry...

204
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,960
Get back to the cabin.

205
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,760
Hurry up.

206
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,440
Hurry...

207
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:38,840
Hurry up.

208
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,000
Quick.

209
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,040
Get back to the cabin. Quick.

210
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,200
How dare you!

211
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,880
You have a relationship with Wang Lide.

212
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,080
Why didn't you tell us about it?

213
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,120
Please spare me.

214
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,880
Please spare me, Sir.

215
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,400
Do you want to get us all killed?

216
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,240
Ms. Yusu.

217
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,560
Please spare me.

218
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,480
Don't be afraid.

219
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,760
Tell me

220
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,680
what Wang Lide told you

221
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,560
before he set sail.

222
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,520
He said he'd be gone for a month or two

223
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,440
and make a lot of money.

224
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,400
He'd come back to buy me out and marry me.

225
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,400
She believes such words from a man?

226
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,840
Who does he hang around with?

227
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,320
I don't know.

228
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,080
I don't know...

229
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,000
I don't know.

230
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,240
I really don't know.

231
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,320
Where's the gold?

232
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,400
I really don't know.

233
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,400
I don't know.

234
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,160
I don't know.

235
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,720
I don't know.

236
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,600
Take your time and think.

237
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,640
We don't have better things to do
on this ship anyway.

238
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,840
Someone!

239
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,440
- Yes.
- Yes.

240
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,480
I really don't know.

241
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,480
I don't know.

242
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,440
No...

243
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:19,800
Get up.

244
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,560
No.

245
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,320
Magistrate Di.

246
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,240
An...

247
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,320
Save me.

248
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,440
An.

249
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,480
Magistrate Di.

250
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,760
Commissioner.

251
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,640
Deputy Secretary Hou said

252
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,720
you were up late last night dealing
with paperwork.

253
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,240
Did you find out anything?

254
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,840
While we're on the subject,

255
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,320
there's something

256
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,640
I'd like to ask

257
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,760
Director Yi.

258
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,360
Me?

259
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,920
the Commission of Maritime Trade
has four small ships

260
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,040
and one large ship

261
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,320
for harbor patrol,

262
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,200
right?

263
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,600
To guard the wharves and collect taxes,

264
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,920
this is the Director
of the Commission of Maritime Trade...

265
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,400
Only the big ship
can sail the seas, right?

266
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,480
So what?

267
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,920
A dozen days ago,

268
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,800
on the sixth day of the seventh month,

269
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,600
Director Yi led a big ship out in the dark

270
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,000
and didn't return until dawn,

271
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,400
right?

272
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,600
The same day as Wang Lide's incident?

273
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,200
Yes.

274
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,240
Magistrate Di,

275
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,080
Jin Sang isn't enough?

276
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,440
You're accusing me, too.

277
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,800
What's wrong with my sailing?

278
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,400
Those smugglers often dock

279
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,840
in the midnight in small ships.

280
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,640
I received a tip-off.

281
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,520
I work hard for the court.

282
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,400
How can you turn it into a crime?

283
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,760
I

284
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,320
just wanted to consult you.

285
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,640
Consult?

286
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,120
You call it consulting?

287
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,680
Why don't you ask me directly?

288
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,040
Just ask me

289
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,720
why it's such a coincidence

290
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,880
that I set sail on the same night

291
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,800
of Wang Lide's incident,

292
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,760
right?

293
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,080
Yes.

294
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,040
Why was it such a coincidence?

295
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,360
What a murderous heart.

296
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,880
Why don't you just say

297
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,720
I set sail that night

298
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,160
to see Wang Lide

299
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,320
and I also took gold?

300
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,840
Jin Sang said

301
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,280
the gold was in a big box.

302
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,160
There were more than ten people
on my ship.

303
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,920
If I hid the gold,

304
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,280
how could I hide it from the whole ship?

305
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,360
Commissioner Liu.

306
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,400
Commissioner Liu,

307
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,080
if you don't believe me,

308
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,880
we can get the answer
when we get back to Penglai.

309
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:46,960
Commissioner Liu,

310
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,240
it's getting foggy outside.

311
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:48,920
I think

312
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,840
everyone better return
to their cabins and rest

313
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,720
just in case.

314
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,280
We'll investigate later.

315
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,120
Mr. Gu,

316
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,560
is that you?

317
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,520
Magistrate Di.

318
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,680
Mr. Gu.

319
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,000
It's foggy. I'm just checking around.

320
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,640
Mr. Gu.

321
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,280
What are you thinking?

322
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,110
It's really suspicious.

323
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,160
Yes.

324
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,800
Wang Lide

325
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,000
is the gold dealer.

326
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,880
He's a broker.

327
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,360
He needs a buyer and a seller.

328
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,600
The buyer must be from Baekje,

329
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,200
but what about the Modao?

330
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,160
Tamna and Silla

331
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,440
have been at war with Baekje for years.

332
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,520
Hasn't Baekje been conquered?

333
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,440
Are you saying

334
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,760
that the Baekje use gold
to smuggle arms from Tang?

335
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,280
Why not?

336
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,720
The fog has lifted. Come out.

337
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,560
Everyone come out to work.

338
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,280
Something happened over there.

339
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,560
It's Director Yi.

340
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,560
Director Yi!

341
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,080
Everyone, look!

342
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,800
It's really Director Yi!

343
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,280
Master.

344
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:24,640
Master.

345
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,160
Open the door.

346
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,320
From tonight on,

347
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,600
I won't sleep alone.

348
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,760
I'll sleep here.

349
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,520
Bai Kai, you sleep next to me over there.

350
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,520
You two sleep outside.

351
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,200
Yes.

352
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,280
Whenever I go out,

353
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,160
follow me every step of the way.

354
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,840
If any bastard dares to hide
in the dark to harm me,

355
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,160
kill him

356
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,040
as soon as he appears.

357
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,160
Suicide

358
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,600
or murder?

359
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,720
Commissioner Liu,

360
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,960
we're investigating now.

361
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,600
Everything's up in the air.

362
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,800
What are you doing?

363
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,160
You two,

364
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,560
one is a chief of
the Ministry of Punishments,

365
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,760
the other

366
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,560
is the magistrate appointed
by Her Majesty.

367
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,960
Please calm down.

368
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,160
If there's a murderer,

369
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,520
he must've taken advantage of the fog.

370
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,160
And he

371
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,120
must know Director Yi.

372
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,280
Otherwise,

373
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,840
he'd have resisted.

374
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,680
Shipmaster,

375
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,320
Gu Mengbin.

376
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,960
When the fog started,

377
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,320
sailors were on deck.

378
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,360
Mr. Gu and his attendant, Bai Kai,

379
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,400
were also on deck.

380
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,240
They didn't see Director Yi.

381
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,000
What's strange

382
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,800
is that I just found out

383
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,440
Director Yi set sail
at night ten days ago,

384
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,120
then he was gone.

385
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,760
Unfortunately,

386
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,480
we can't investigate now.

387
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,920
We'll have to wait until we return

388
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,040
to Penglai.

389
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,880
Magistrate Di,

390
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,600
don't you think

391
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,200
too many people are following me

392
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,560
on this voyage?

393
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,600
Sir, you mean...

394
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,720
They're all crying out to serve me.

395
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,120
Director Yi, Mr. Gu,

396
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,440
and two singers.

397
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,640
Didn't you

398
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,960
ask to bring the two singers?

399
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,240
That's because
when I first came to Penglai,

400
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,920
you interrupted me

401
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,520
before I could finish

402
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,640
enjoying a song.

403
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,800
So I didn't get enough.

404
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,240
But after we boarded the ship,

405
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,280
I realized that the Baekje singer

406
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,280
was not telling the truth.

407
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,480
I don't think

408
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,120
anyone on this ship

409
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,040
is telling the truth.

410
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,120
Let me repeat.

411
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,400
Magistrate Di, it was your first clue

412
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,640
that led us to the ship.

413
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,440
If you still can't find the culprit,

414
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,560
I'll have

415
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,600
to do it myself.

416
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,760
After Yusu,

417
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,920
I'll interrogate Ms. Cao.

418
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,520
Tai.

419
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,240
Tai, don't go.

420
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,120
Tai.

421
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,000
Tai...

422
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,720
- Yusu.
- Tai.

423
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,880
Yusu.

424
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,240
Yusu.

425
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,160
I'm so thirsty.

426
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,920
I want some water.

427
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,200
Water...

428
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:46,920
She wants some water.

429
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,920
- Some water.
- Some water.

430
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,000
Some water...

431
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,000
Water.

432
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,320
Water.

433
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,960
Quick...

434
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:54,800
Here's some water.

435
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,160
Hurry up.

436
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,840
Open the door.

437
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,720
Tai.

438
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,760
Open the door.

439
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,880
Yusu, hold on.

440
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,160
Guard outside.

441
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,920
Hurry up.

442
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:09,720
Yusu.

443
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,800
Take it slow.

444
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,720
Take it slow.

445
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,920
What's wrong...

446
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,280
It hurts.

447
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,240
It hurts.

448
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,600
Tough it out.

449
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,680
Let me apply some medicine to your wound.

450
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,280
Magistrate Di.

451
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,240
Mr. Gu,

452
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,640
I've brought you
Wang Lide's star leading board.

453
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,800
The size
of each star leading board varies.

454
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,320
If you want to restore
Wang Lide's observation,

455
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,760
you must use his board.

456
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,280
The six-finger board is too small.
Get a seven-finger board.

457
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,520
It's right this time.

458
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,840
Polaris on a seven-finger board.

459
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,120
Along Mr. Gu's direction,

460
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,520
Vega

461
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,400
is exactly flush with the top edge
of the three-finger board.

462
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,360
From one finger to 12 fingers,

463
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,520
there's always a board that matches.

464
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,400
Pollux and Procyon, two fingers.

465
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,160
Polaris, six fingers.

466
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,280
Vega, eight fingers.

467
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,360
Pollux and Procyon, two fingers.

468
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,120
That's weird.

469
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,480
What's weird about it?

470
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,640
Previously at Commissioner Liu's place,

471
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,920
I took a look at Wang Lide's chart.

472
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,880
Based on the marks on it,

473
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,080
Polaris,

474
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,840
Vega

475
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,840
and Pollux and Procyo

476
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,760
were also six, eight, and two fingers.

477
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,040
The mast is broken.

478
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,320
The rudder is also broken.

479
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,560
But we're still sailing
on Wang Lide's course.

480
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,680
We're being pushed by the currents.

481
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,320
It seems his course

482
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,520
also just follows the currents.

483
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,480
Let me go.

484
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,240
- Let me go.
- Are you mad?

485
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,760
Who gave you the balls?

486
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,400
I don't believe Yusu is an evildoer.

487
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,480
What a nice girl.

488
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,400
She's so kind.

489
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,200
Have you ever seen
such a kind-hearted evildoer?

490
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:18,880
Are you stupid?

491
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,280
Which evildoer will write
"evildoer" on the face?

492
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,440
Don't trust people too easily. You know?

493
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,040
Why are you all so cruel?

494
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,120
Look at her hands.

495
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,440
Don't you feel sorry for her?

496
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,280
Tai,

497
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,360
I stopped you

498
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,320
because I didn't want you
to get into trouble, okay?

499
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,880
If the Yulin Guards find out,

500
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,440
you'll get Magistrate in trouble again.

501
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,520
I don't believe he'll see her
in danger without trying to help.

502
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,320
What?

503
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:46,640
Shh.

504
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,960
Bai Kai?

505
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,080
Yusu.

506
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,640
Bai Kai?

507
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:29,960
Bai Kai?

508
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,000
I... I didn't tell them anything.

509
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,840
Don't kill me.

510
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,760
You won't stand it.

511
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,120
You must die for the sake of Baekje.

512
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,200
I didn't tell them anything.

513
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,720
You know too much already.

514
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:48,960
Don't kill me.

515
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,600
Stop.

516
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,480
It's you again.

517
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,120
So you're from Baekje, too.

518
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,760
Stop fighting.

519
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,480
Stop it!

520
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,960
Stop.

521
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,280
Stop there.

522
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,880
Stop. Stop there.

523
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,360
Stop.

524
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,640
Don't let him get away.

525
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,000
Stop there.

526
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,800
He's a Baekje.

527
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,040
So what?

528
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,800
Why are you pretending to be Tang?

529
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,200
Seems like Baekje is collapsing.

530
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,760
Nonsense.

531
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,600
If anyone slanders Baekje people again,

532
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,080
I'll fight them to death.

533
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,960
Who on earth are you?

534
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,920
I'm the captain
of the Huben Guards of Baekje.

535
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:50,920
Bai Kai.

536
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,240
Baekje's been at war with Silla and Tamna

537
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,440
for years.

538
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,480
You hide in Penglai

539
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,600
to smuggle armaments?

540
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,800
You let Yusu approach Wang Lide

541
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,120
to manipulate him, right?

542
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,240
Bai Kai,

543
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,920
don't resist.

544
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,840
Let her go.

545
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,320
Yusu is innocent.

546
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,200
She knows nothing.

547
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,640
Yusu,

548
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,040
I'm sorry.

549
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:14,720
No.

550
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,320
Wang Lide is smuggling gold
for you this time.

551
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,440
Where is he?

552
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,320
I don't know.

553
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,400
Bai Kai, put the knife down.

554
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,800
You'll only be charged with smuggling.

555
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,440
Wang Lide is just a broker.

556
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,760
He can't supply enough armaments.

557
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,040
There must

558
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,480
be a high-ranking official behind him.

559
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,560
Tell me,

560
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,720
who is that official?

561
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,280
Interesting.

562
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,000
Baekje will not die!

563
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,880
Long live Baekje!

564
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,200
Bai Kai.

565
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,560
Bai Kai.

566
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:01,880
Bai Kai.

567
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,600
Bai Kai.

568
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,080
Bai Kai.

569
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,800
No!

570
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,560
Over a day and a night,

571
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,960
significant incidents happened
on the ship.

572
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,920
Yi Pan is suspected to have been murdered.

573
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,480
Bai Kai resisted arrest and is dead.

574
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,320
Based on the measurement
of the star leading board,

575
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,680
we've been drifting

576
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,400
along Wang Lide's course.

577
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,160
The clues of the gold case

578
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,720
are becoming clearer.

579
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,720
Mr. Hong,

580
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,520
if you don't come to save us,

581
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,640
more and more people
are dying on the ship.

582
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,440
Don't kill me.

583
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,800
Don't kill me.

584
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,600
Don't kill me.

585
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,080
Yusu.

586
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,800
Yusu.

587
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,200
Qiao Tai.

588
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,680
Sis.

589
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,320
Don't be afraid...

590
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,640
Qiao Tai and Magistrate Di
asked for mercy for you

591
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,920
so you go back to the cabin and rest.

592
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,920
Why do you still want to board the ship?

593
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,960
Magistrate Di.

594
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,800
About Wang Lide and Bai Kai,

595
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,600
what else do you know?

596
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,400
Wang Lide was actually brought here
by Bai Kai.

597
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,840
I've never asked

598
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,120
about what happened between them.

599
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,080
Magistrate,

600
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,200
Deputy Secretary Hou wants to see you.

601
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,920
If you remember anything,

602
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,840
tell Ms. Cao

603
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,960
and let her come to me.

604
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,520
Yes.

605
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,600
Given the circumstances,

606
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,200
you must be very careful.

607
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,760
If there's nothing urgent,
stay inside the cabin.

608
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,800
If anything happens,

609
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,120
I'll come looking for you.

610
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,560
Yes, sir.

611
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,680
You wanted to see me?

612
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,560
I suggest you

613
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,920
putting a leash on Qiao Tai.

614
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,320
The Yulin Guards told me

615
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,920
he visited Yusu many times

616
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,040
while she was in custody.

617
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,400
I'm worried

618
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,240
that this will reach Commissioner Liu.

619
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,560
I see.

620
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,160
I always feel

621
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,320
that Yusu

622
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,200
has more secrets.

623
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,640
Sis,

624
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,080
now I don't think

625
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,640
I can trust anyone.

626
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,720
Magistrate Di is a Junzi.

627
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,960
You can trust him.

628
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,160
Do you think

629
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,800
Wang Lide is still alive?

630
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,440
You still care about that man?

631
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,680
I don't know where he is.

632
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,240
Is he suffering

633
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,520
like me?

634
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,120
What kind of man is he?

635
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:02,800
He...

636
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,640
He's a good-hearted man.

637
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,040
He said before he met me,

638
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,640
he liked gold the most.

639
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,080
But when he met me,

640
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,320
he thought nothing
was more important than me.

641
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:26,600
He may not look so good,

642
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,080
but with a delicate touch.

643
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,840
He can even play stringed instrument.

644
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,710
He's very good at it.

645
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,120
Really?

646
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,400
When we were together,

647
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,400
he always played
stringed instrument for me.

648
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,720
He said we switched roles.

649
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,360
I was the guest

650
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,960
and he was more like a singer,

651
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,360
which made me very happy.

652
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,800
Before he set sail,

653
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,720
he even got a copy
of music score from the capital

654
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,640
and played me a new piece.

655
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,000
Sis,

656
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,560
do you have someone you love?

657
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,320
I see

658
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,720
Magistrate Di does care for you.

659
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,920
In the night there are shocking waves,

660
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,160
but in the daytime it's calm and tranquil.

661
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,040
I know a thing or two

662
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,520
about the tides and the stars.

663
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,160
My grandfather was a military officer.

664
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,440
He used to go to sea for battle.

665
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,040
When the war was over,

666
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,840
he had nothing better to do

667
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,520
than to teach me these.

668
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,760
I was too young at that time

669
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,160
to learn these.

670
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,160
He scolded me many times.

671
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,760
This time, in Penglai,

672
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,520
I saw the chart
and the star leading board.

673
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,560
They remind me

674
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,080
of his teachings.

675
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,720
I've never heard you talk
about your grandfather.

676
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,080
You didn't ask me.

677
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,320
He passed

678
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,400
away long ago.

679
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,480
Stop.

680
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,000
I'm here to see Commissioner Liu.

681
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,880
You must have permission
from Deputy Secretary Hou.

682
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,240
Who's out there?

683
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,760
It's me.

684
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,680
I have important business.

685
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,400
Come inside.

686
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,600
Mr. Gu.

687
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,880
How dare you!

688
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,440
How dare you bring

689
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,880
out gold at a time like this?

690
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,760
This isn't Baekje gold.

691
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,480
This is Tang gold.

692
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,000
Sir, please take a look.

693
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,240
There's an inscription on it,

694
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,200
"Hebei Circuit".

695
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,400
Tang produces gold, too.

696
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,080
I'm afraid Commissioner Liu

697
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,520
won't appreciate this trifling gift.

698
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,880
When we get back to the shore,

699
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,040
I'll pay my respects.

700
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,520
You want me to accept your gift.

701
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,760
What do you want?

702
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,720
I understand.

703
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,920
You're here to investigate Baekje gold.

704
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,440
The Baekje gold flows
from Penglai to the capital.

705
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,760
As a shipmaster in Penglai,

706
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,440
I find it hard to avoid slanders.

707
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,880
Even if I say I had nothing to do with it,

708
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,440
people would say I did.

709
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,200
So were you involved?

710
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,360
I'm here

711
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,840
to report, Commissioner.

712
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,520
Who are you reporting?

713
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,160
Magistrate Di.

714
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,920
Di Renjie.

715
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:20,600
Exactly.

716
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,480
Didn't you see what a devil his man,
Qiao Tai, was?

717
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,400
Last night,

718
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,840
they forced Bai Kai to jump into the sea

719
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,440
rather than let you catch him alive.

720
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,360
Is that so?

721
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,960
There's been a spate of deaths
on the ship over the past few days,

722
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,560
indicating that
the murderer has nothing to fear.

723
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,880
He tricked everyone to board the ship

724
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,800
and then lured everyone here

725
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,440
to create a dead case.

726
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,160
But the case must be closed.

727
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,200
There must be a suspect
reporting to the court.

728
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,920
Mr. Yi is dead.

729
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,720
I've been thinking about it.

730
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,040
I think Di Renjie is the most suspicious.

731
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,240
Di Renjie has a close relationship
with the singer

732
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,360
from Penglai.

733
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,400
Don't you know that?

734
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,280
You mean

735
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,720
Ms. Cao who plays stringed instrument?

736
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,440
There are only two singers on board.

737
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,240
Ms. Cao is his confidante.

738
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,760
Yusu is Wang Lide's lover.

739
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,320
What if Di Renjie and Wang Lide
are in cahoots,

740
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,320
secretly controlling the gold smuggling?

741
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,480
When the thin guy from Baekje
was found on the ship,

742
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,640
why did Di Renjie rush to get Yusu

743
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,080
to be the interpreter?

744
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,600
He was afraid that the thin guy
would spill the beans.

745
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,840
Spill what?

746
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,560
Maybe he already did.

747
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,440
Only Yusu understood.

748
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,320
The secret is with Yusu.

749
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,320
So on the ship,

750
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,360
as soon as Yusu was taken into custody,

751
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,680
Di Renjie and his men got anxious

752
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,000
and sent Qiao Tai to visit her.

753
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,640
The Yulin Guards can testify.

754
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,080
Really?

755
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,560
Now,

756
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,760
he's put Yusu in Ms. Cao's cabin.

757
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,560
See for yourself if you don't believe me.

758
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,000
If the situation is critical,

759
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,040
Di Renjie will give himself away

760
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,280
covering up for Yusu again.

761
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,800
I'll wait and see.

762
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,760
If he dares to do so,

763
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,200
he

764
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,120
has everything to do

765
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,200
with the gold case.
