[This is a work of fiction.
Any resemblance is purely coincidental.]

5
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,320
Magistrate!

6
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,880
Mind your own business!

7
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,760
Magistrate, they have reinforcements.

8
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,040
Just run away.

9
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,080
Are you still a man?

10
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,640
Not as manly as you.

11
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,480
Let's go.

12
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,680
Don't move.

13
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,480
Magistrate,

14
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,120
they are just a few roving bandits.

15
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,160
Watch out for their big troops.

16
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,080
They might launch attacks at any time.

17
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,360
Don't think I would thank you.

18
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,080
Magistrate,

19
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,120
he's been following us all along.

20
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,520
Go.

21
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,040
Go.

22
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:18,840
Go.

23
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,160
Mutton.

24
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,360
Fresh mutton. Take a look.

25
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,160
Mutton. Sheepskin.

26
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,760
Mutton. Sheepskin.

27
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,480
Magistrate,

28
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,600
he has been following us all along.

29
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,440
How do you know he is following us?

30
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,520
Perhaps he is also coming to the fair.

31
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,200
Well,

32
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,960
we don't know his identity.

33
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,800
What if he is a bandit?

34
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,920
I don't care about his identity.

35
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,960
Even if he is from Heiyan, I don't care.

36
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,640
What I want to know

37
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,680
is his purpose.

38
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,280
Okay.

39
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,760
How much?

40
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,160
It's for free.

41
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,200
I'll water the horse.

42
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,600
What's this?

43
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,800
She can't understand your language.

44
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,800
I'll trade you this knife for this.

45
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,080
This is a Wolf Drug.

46
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,440
If you spread a bottle of this
on the ground,

47
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,280
it can attract all the wolfdogs
within a five-li radius.

48
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,040
There is such a powerful Wolf Drug
in the Western Regions?

49
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,920
It's such a big world.

50
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,240
There are a lot of things
we've never seen,

51
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,240
languages you can't comprehend,

52
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,000
and rules you don't understand.

53
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,080
Is this okay?

54
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,360
This should be okay.

55
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,680
Tali.

56
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,800
Tali.

57
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,280
Tali.

58
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,280
Tali.

59
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,200
Sir.

60
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,280
Sir.

61
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,080
Why are you crying?

62
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,080
Ask him

63
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,320
what's the matter with him.

64
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,280
Tali.

65
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,440
What happened?

66
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,840
My eagle died.

67
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,520
I had kept it for 13 years.

68
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,480
He said he had seen Han Yongnan.

69
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,360
Where did he see him?

70
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,200
Tali.

71
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,670
Ask him.

72
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,640
How did it die?

73
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,520
I wanted to take it to the fair
and buy some food.

74
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,120
Who would have known

75
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,150
that it died on the way?

76
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,600
It was too late. I couldn't take it away.

77
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,640
So I buried it in the desert.

78
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,920
Tali.

79
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,200
He said his daughter had seen
the arrest warrant.

80
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,080
She wanted to report it.

81
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,440
But Han Yongnan killed her.

82
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,600
Her body is still in the desert.

83
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,440
Tali is his daughter's name.

84
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,320
Tell him

85
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,400
I will definitely catch Han Yongnan.

86
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,400
Tali.

87
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,200
We will find it.

88
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,280
You must find it.

89
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,920
Tali.

90
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,160
I told him.

91
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,440
But he said...

92
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,760
Tali.

93
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,640
He hopes you can kill him yourself.

94
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,560
Ask him

95
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,240
if he knows which way

96
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,160
Han Yongnan fled.

97
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,040
Where is it buried?

98
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,600
Over there.

99
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,920
Magistrate,

100
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,840
that eagle seemed
to have followed us all along.

101
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,000
Look ahead.

102
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,360
[Zhenxi Fortress]
This is the frontier Zhenxi Fortress.

103
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,760
It's the westmost place.

104
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,880
I am Di Renjie,
the Magistrate of Lanfang County.

105
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,640
Why should I believe you?

106
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,400
Do you know what that place is?

107
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,600
We risk our lives to stay here

108
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,800
in case the bandits break in

109
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,040
and to guard against you spies.

110
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,840
What nonsense are you talking about?
Who are spies?

111
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,800
Several hours ago,

112
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,080
we just fought the bandits.

113
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,280
Magistrate Di,

114
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,440
why did you come all the way here

115
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,520
from Lanfang County?

116
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,280
They are chasing an escaped criminal.

117
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,640
He must be here now.

118
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,480
How does

119
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,440
that man look?

120
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,480
He has big eyes

121
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,600
and looks very gentle.

122
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,040
There is a mole between his eyes.

123
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,720
Follow me.

124
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,480
I might have seen the man

125
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,360
you are looking for.

126
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,440
I'm a soldier in the protectorate.

127
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,960
I'm responsible
for guarding Zhenxi Fortress.

128
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,480
[Huo Huaili]
My name is Huo Huaili.

129
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,760
Open the gate.

130
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,420
[Zhenxi Fortress]

131
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,600
That

132
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,560
is the man you are looking for.

133
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,160
He's dead?

134
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,360
Don't touch him.

135
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,840
The plague.

136
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,360
Half a day ago,

137
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,640
he knocked at the gate,

138
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,240
saying he was a merchant.

139
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,560
Their caravan was attacked by bandits.

140
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,440
Only he survived.

141
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:18,880
We had

142
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,680
taken him in.

143
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,880
But he tried to steal a horse
to cross the border.

144
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,520
He also killed a man.

145
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,280
Magistrate,

146
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,840
bandits,

147
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:29,880
plague,

148
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,240
and sandstorm

149
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,080
scare us already.

150
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,720
Time for dinner.

151
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,960
Time for dinner.

152
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,160
Time for dinner.

153
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,120
Yours.

154
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,240
Magistrate Di,

155
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,080
the weather is cold.

156
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,080
I've brought some wine

157
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,120
to warm everyone up.

158
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,400
Not really very good wine.

159
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,240
Please don't mind it.

160
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,160
Magistrate Di,

161
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,240
when you go back,

162
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,560
please give the governor a message

163
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,600
for me.

164
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,240
Tell him

165
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,600
that everything is fine here.

166
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,680
If the visiting envoy comes here,

167
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,080
a lot of money will be spent.

168
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,680
We also need to receive him.

169
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,120
It's better to save the money.

170
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,640
We can buy some military hardware

171
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,560
and pay the soldiers.

172
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,360
You said he had stolen a horse
and had killed someone.

173
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,040
Who did he kill?

174
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,920
He is called Zhou Changyi.

175
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,480
From Ezhou.

176
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,080
Zhou Changyi.

177
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,080
Actually, there is one good thing
if a man is dead.

178
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,760
Others can share

179
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,360
his portion of food.

180
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,240
To Zhou Changyi.

181
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,400
To Zhou Changyi.

182
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,800
Zhou Changyi.

183
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,280
Open the gate.

184
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,400
If I had known he was a wanted man,

185
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,080
I wouldn't have given him a quick death.

186
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,920
What are you eating?

187
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,720
Is it tasty?

188
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:50,760
Is this

189
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,520
what you usually eat?

190
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,360
Why don't you ask your officer to write
a letter to the military administration?

191
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,120
The visiting envoy will come
to take care of you.

192
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,120
The garrison is relieved
every four years.

193
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,920
There are people taking care of this.

194
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,040
But we don't need the visiting envoy.

195
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,600
If you have nothing to do,

196
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,760
go back and rest early.

197
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,120
This is a military area.

198
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,400
Don't walk around.

199
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,680
The wine is good.

200
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,040
Take it slow.

201
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,440
He is drunk.

202
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,120
It's okay.

203
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,520
Lash mark.

204
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,560
Magistrate, look,

205
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,070
this city

206
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,640
has to ward against bandits,

207
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,240
thieves,

208
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,560
and wolves.

209
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,400
They are all thinking

210
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,760
about how to barge in and devour us.

211
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,960
When I just came,

212
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,960
I was so terrified
that I couldn't sleep all night.

213
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,000
But now

214
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,800
I can't even remember where this is.

215
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,200
I

216
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,480
belong here when I'm alive.

217
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,560
I will become a ghost here after I die.

218
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,400
Did he leave any words

219
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,520
before he died?

220
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,200
I don't quite understand.

221
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,320
People say the Lanfang County dialect
is difficult to understand.

222
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,560
He was mumbling something.

223
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,400
Very hard to understand.

224
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,880
I remember

225
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,680
before he was strangled to death,

226
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,320
he was mumbling

227
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,440
that he was fed up to the back teeth.

228
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,840
Magistrate,

229
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,280
I also grew up in Chang'an
since I was a child.

230
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,240
After all,

231
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,760
we can understand

232
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,640
each other.

233
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:22,820
[Archive]

234
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,520
Well, what are you looking for?

235
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,160
That was not

236
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,080
Han Yongnan's body.

237
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm checking the background

238
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,440
of these soldiers in Zhenxi Fortress.

239
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,040
Their native places,

240
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,600
enlistment time,

241
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,760
and usual weapons.

242
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,840
Why are you checking
all this information?

243
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,760
Here is a record

244
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,120
about Huo Huaili.

245
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,640
His usual weapon

246
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,040
is a three-section whip.

247
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,760
A whip?

248
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,640
Lash mark.

249
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:57,960
Just now,

250
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,320
I did see lash marks

251
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,200
on those soldiers.

252
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,720
So

253
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,040
they were caused
by the three-section whip.

254
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,760
No wonder the barracks are so dead.

255
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,360
Huo Huaili is so despicable.

256
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,720
But I think

257
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,280
they respect Huo Huaili very much.

258
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,480
Most of these soldiers

259
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,280
are from a place

260
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,520
called Zhou Village

261
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,000
in Ezhou.

262
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,280
Among them,

263
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,880
there are two brothers.

264
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,360
Zhou Changyong.

265
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,320
Zhou Changyi.

266
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,080
What's hiding under there?

267
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,400
Let's go take a look.

268
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,720
Go over there to take a look.

269
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:40,640
This...

270
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,400
This is Huo Huaili's three-section whip?

271
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,680
Magistrate Di,

272
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,760
now that you've discovered it,

273
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,640
please come out.

274
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,560
What are you going to do with us?

275
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,320
You will make up

276
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,640
a reason that we stole horses
to cross the border.

277
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,600
Then you will kill us

278
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,920
and hang our bodies?

279
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,280
You are an official
appointed by the court.

280
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,800
If I kill you,

281
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,880
I will be cut into pieces.

282
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,200
You know the law of Tang?

283
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,200
Just because I know the law,

284
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,080
I killed Huo Huaili.

285
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,600
Zhou Changyi.

286
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,700
[Huo Huaili]

287
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,480
[Zhou Changyi]
Your commanding officer

288
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,840
Huo Huaili

289
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,120
[Three-section iron whip]
killed your brother Zhou Changyong.

290
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,600
So, you killed him.

291
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,880
You incited a riot,

292
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,840
offended your superior,

293
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,200
and assumed his identity.

294
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,120
According to the law,

295
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,720
you should have been killed
several times.

296
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,880
He did as he pleased.

297
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,920
He beat us whenever he wanted.

298
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,560
But that is called
training new soldiers.

299
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,200
It was not a crime.

300
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,840
When he was in a bad mood,

301
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,040
he took it out on us soldiers.

302
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,640
This is called giving exhortations.

303
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,200
It was not a crime, either.

304
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,120
He beat my brother to death.

305
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,840
But this is called accidental homicide.

306
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,200
He still couldn't be convicted.

307
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,560
We couldn't bear it.

308
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,680
We had nowhere to complain.

309
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,920
We were even punished by him.

310
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,760
He locked us up for seven days
without giving us food or water.

311
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,680
In order to survive,

312
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,640
we had no choice

313
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,040
but to kill him.

314
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,320
However,

315
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,600
we have thus committed a heinous crime

316
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,880
and should be sentenced to death.

317
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,720
Magistrate Di,

318
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,960
who does the law

319
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,520
actually support?

320
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,720
Whose law is this?

321
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,680
If you want to arrest Changyi,

322
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,120
kill me first!

323
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,440
Don't move.

324
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,480
Don't be silly.

325
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,840
Don't move. Put down the knife.

326
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,160
They just want to survive.

327
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,320
They did nothing wrong.

328
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,920
Huo Huaili deserved to die.

329
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,240
I tell you,

330
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,360
if I were a soldier here,

331
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,320
I would do the same.

332
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,840
Speak!

333
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,840
Huo Huaili

334
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,880
did deserve to die.

335
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,600
But there are thousands of soldiers
guarding the borders of Tang.

336
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,760
If they all mutinied

337
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,880
and killed their officers

338
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,040
because the latter

339
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,960
were tyrannical,

340
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,240
the prosperity and stability of Tang

341
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,520
would be lost.

342
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,680
Well,

343
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,640
what should we do

344
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,720
at that time?

345
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,480
Bravo.

346
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,600
So high-sounding.

347
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,240
You tell me

348
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,840
what they can do.

349
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,840
They have no power.

350
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,560
They can only wait for death?

351
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,480
Cut the crap.

352
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,320
Get us out of here first.

353
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,480
Why?

354
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:15,920
You...

355
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,240
The less you have to do

356
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,840
in this world, the better.

357
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:23,600
Fine.

358
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,360
Okay.

359
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,960
I'll tell those soldiers later

360
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,880
that you are with us.

361
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,400
Let them bring you in, too.

362
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,320
Daguan,

363
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,280
who don't you speak?

364
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,160
You can't answer me?

365
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,120
What Zhou Changyi did

366
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,520
is very common in this world.

367
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,520
There are also many people
like Han Yongnan.

368
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,720
You didn't catch the ones
you should catch,

369
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,840
but caught the ones you shouldn't.

370
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,760
You stormed a hundred li

371
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,640
and now your life is in danger.

372
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,280
Is it worth it?

373
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,040
Zhou Changyi incited a riot

374
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,440
and killed his officer.

375
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,920
He deserves to die.

376
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,760
Han Yongnan raped a young girl

377
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,320
and broke the law of Tang.

378
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,760
He also deserves to die.

379
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,680
I, Di Renjie,

380
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,400
am an official appointed by the court.

381
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,040
I have to do this.

382
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,840
You remind me of my father.

383
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,960
He died of fever.

384
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,440
I actually hoped he was killed by someone.

385
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,240
That way, I could have an enemy.

386
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,080
I could travel a long way
to seek revenge

387
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,240
and kill the enemy to vent my hatred.

388
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,000
I could feel better that way.

389
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,480
I catch Han Yongnan

390
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,520
not to take revenge.

391
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,440
I'll take him back to Lanfang County

392
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,680
to stand trial.

393
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,160
Yes.

394
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,920
You will take him back
to your Magistrate's Office.

395
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,640
It will also be you

396
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,520
who will judge him

397
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,720
and execute him.

398
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,040
What's the difference?

399
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,680
I don't understand your laws or rules,

400
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,600
nor do I want to understand them.

401
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,920
But I know

402
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,720
all men, no matter how high or low,

403
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,240
are beasts

404
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,600
beneath the skin.

405
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,360
It's just that some are domineering

406
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,920
and some are trampled upon.

407
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,840
Han Yongnan is a dhole in Lanfang County,

408
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,080
showing his teeth.

409
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,040
But in this place,

410
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,360
he is not even a rat.

411
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,840
He could be torn into pieces
at any time.

412
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,400
There are bandits.

413
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,280
The bandits are coming.

414
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,840
The bandits are coming.

415
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,320
What's the matter?

416
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,680
Come here.

417
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,240
Come here.

418
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,360
Hurry up!

419
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,520
Attack!

420
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,280
Shoot them!

421
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,480
What do you want to do?

422
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,160
I'm warning you.

423
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,160
If you kill the Magistrate,

424
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,640
you will be cut into pieces.

425
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,120
Now the bandits are attacking us.

426
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,440
I must protect the city now.

427
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,840
You hurry up and leave.

428
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,400
Don't come back.

429
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:08,580
[Tang]

430
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,080
Push! Harder!

431
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,000
Harder!

432
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,160
Hurry up. Come and help!

433
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:53,620
[Zhenxi Fortress]

434
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,480
You can report it
to the military office.

435
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,120
But the riot

436
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,120
and the killing of Huo Huaili

437
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,240
were done by me alone.

438
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,840
It has nothing to do with others.

439
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,720
These soldiers are guarding this place.

440
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,280
They are patriotic
and loyal to the emperor.

441
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,440
They have made no mistake.
