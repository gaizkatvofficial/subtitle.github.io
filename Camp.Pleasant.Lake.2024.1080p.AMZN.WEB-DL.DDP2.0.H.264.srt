1
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,432
- You know what
this reminds me of?

2
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,568
That joint you were supposed
to spark up two exits ago.

3
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:42,704
- Ah, all right, all
right, all right!

4
00:01:42,737 --> 00:01:45,740
Just give me a second.

5
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,875
- Come on, come on!

6
00:01:56,618 --> 00:01:58,218
- What are you doin', man?

7
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,486
Why you stoppin'?

8
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,355
- I wanna see if
this guy needs help.

9
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:03,091
- At 2 a.m.
in the middle of nowhere?

10
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,759
- Ah, you're just high.

11
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,060
- I'm always high.

12
00:02:06,094 --> 00:02:07,394
What does that have
to do with anything?

13
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:08,529
- You're paranoid, too.

14
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:11,264
Don't touch anything.

15
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,567
I'll be back in a second.

16
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:18,271
- If you're not back
in five minutes,

17
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,339
I'm leaving you, man!

18
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,183
I'm telling you, man,

19
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:31,385
he's probably a killer.

20
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:35,255
- Hey, there.

21
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,924
You, uh, need a hand?

22
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:37,992
- Oh, my gosh, yes!

23
00:02:38,026 --> 00:02:38,826
That would be great.

24
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,094
Thank you.

25
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:43,131
I am, I am not good
with cars.

26
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,466
- Uh, did you call anybody?

27
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:47,535
- No service.

28
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,540
- Yeah, I got nothin' either.

29
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:53,373
You mind if I take a look?

30
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:54,942
- No, please!

31
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:55,810
Thank you.

32
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,851
Where you headed, um?

33
00:03:05,053 --> 00:03:06,319
- Hunter.

34
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,955
We are headed up
to Camp Echo Lake.

35
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:10,091
- The old Camp Pleasant Lake?

36
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,695
- Yeah, new owners bought
it, the Rutherfords,

37
00:03:13,728 --> 00:03:16,396
and they're turning
it into a horror camp.

38
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:19,667
- A what?

39
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:20,835
- A horror camp.

40
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,670
Adults pay good money to relive

41
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:24,772
the legendary horror events.

42
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:27,474
And this week's
theme, Camp of Terror.

43
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,778
- A camp of what?

44
00:03:30,812 --> 00:03:33,147
- It's the story of
the Meadows family,

45
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:35,215
happened 20 years
ago this weekend.

46
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:38,920
Camp of Terror is
what the news call it.

47
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:41,221
John and Ruby Meadows
dropped their kids,

48
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,290
Echo and Jasper,
off at the camp,

49
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:46,127
and Echo was kidnapped.

50
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,962
And they ended up
closin' the lake.

51
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,430
To top it off,

52
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,201
John and Ruby were
brutally murdered

53
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,071
by some crazed maniac
on their way home.

54
00:03:57,105 --> 00:04:01,209
- Uh, um, what happened
to the little girl?

55
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,778
- She was
never seen again.

56
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,048
- And the little brother?

57
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:08,315
- I don't know.

58
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,051
I think he ended
up in foster care.

59
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:12,754
So we were hired to come up

60
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:14,789
and do the special
effects for the camp.

61
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:15,857
- We?

62
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,658
- Yeah, Adam, my
assistant and I.

63
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:19,259
So he's back in the van.

64
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,428
He's pretty sure
you're a serial killer.

65
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,235
- Come on, come on, come on!

66
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:31,973
What was that?

67
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:33,708
- How many kills
do you have to do

68
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:37,111
to be officially
labeled a serial killer?

69
00:04:37,145 --> 00:04:38,546
- What?

70
00:04:47,188 --> 00:04:47,989
- Don't worry,

71
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:49,590
I'm not gonna kill you.

72
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:51,491
- Okay.

73
00:04:51,526 --> 00:04:52,492
Good.

74
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:02,970
- Who's there?

75
00:05:03,004 --> 00:05:03,805
- Ugh.

76
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:09,342
- What was that?

77
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:12,412
Adam, goddammit.

78
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,749
I told you not to
touch anything.

79
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:17,218
- Hey, where you going, man?

80
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,058
What the fuck?

81
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,703
- Hello, and welcome
to Camp Pleasant Lake.

82
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:16,971
- Hi there.
- Hey!

83
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:19,640
- Hope you're all ready
for a weekend of terror!

84
00:07:19,674 --> 00:07:21,275
- I'm excited to see blood.

85
00:07:21,309 --> 00:07:23,177
- Glad to hear it.
- When's the terror start?

86
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,477
- Relax, my man, soon enough.

87
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:25,546
- Awesome!

88
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:26,914
- Hey-
- How was your trip?

89
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:27,748
- Not bad.

90
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:28,783
Do you know where I can

91
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:30,017
find the Rutherfords?
- Yeah.

92
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:30,818
Hopefully, it's
better next time.

93
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:31,786
I'm sorry to hear that.

94
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:33,554
- Yeah, I have had better.

95
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:34,889
- He was snorin' the whole trip.

96
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:36,190
- Hey, do you know who I am?

97
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:38,292
- No one cares, bro!
- Loser!

98
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:41,395
- Look, I am puttin'
this in my report.

99
00:07:41,429 --> 00:07:42,897
- I've been waiting
for this all week.

100
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,198
- Only a week?

101
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:45,866
- Well, my wife's mad I came.

102
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,234
What?

103
00:07:47,268 --> 00:07:48,402
- She hates horror movies.

104
00:07:48,436 --> 00:07:49,670
- Oh, this ain't a movie, man.

105
00:07:49,704 --> 00:07:51,539
This is the real thing.

106
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:53,607
- Aren't you that guy from,
it's that that blog, right?

107
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:54,442
What's the name of it?

108
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,210
- HandleWithScare.com.

109
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:58,112
- Yeah, yeah, that's the one!

110
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,313
- Yeah!

111
00:07:59,347 --> 00:08:01,449
- I think that's the, is it?
- Yeah.

112
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,551
Look, it's been a long trip.

113
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,252
Do you know where I can
find the Rutherfords?

114
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:07,355
- Yeah, they're right over
there by registration.

115
00:08:07,388 --> 00:08:08,422
That's where I'm headed.

116
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:09,489
- Awesome.

117
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:13,561
- Mr. and Mrs. Rutherford?

118
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:14,395
- Yes.

119
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:15,629
- That's us.

120
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:17,198
- I'm so excited
for this weekend.

121
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:18,332
- So are we.

122
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:20,234
- When do we get to see blood?

123
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,369
- The entire weekend.

124
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:24,138
- I can't wait.

125
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:24,972
- Jesus!

126
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,641
These people make me nuts.

127
00:08:29,477 --> 00:08:31,145
Jonah, you made it.

128
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,414
- Ah, Mr. Rutherford,

129
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:37,351
Jonah Perrigo,
HandleWithScare.com.

130
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:39,487
- We know exactly
who you are, Jonah.

131
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,455
- How was your trip?

132
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:44,692
- Well, it is going
to go in my review.

133
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:47,795
- What do you need
from me, Jonah?

134
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,030
- Sleep.

135
00:08:49,063 --> 00:08:50,164
Where are your cabins?

136
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:52,166
All right.

137
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,068
Well, before I go,

138
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:55,970
you got time for
a quick interview?

139
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:57,471
- Jonah, we are so busy.

140
00:08:57,506 --> 00:08:58,773
I don't want to be late, okay?

141
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:00,975
Listen, you get settled in,

142
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:02,243
and then we'll find time

143
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:03,644
for a nice, little
talk later, okay?

144
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:06,213
- Quick question, where
will the first kill be?

145
00:09:06,247 --> 00:09:07,615
- Wouldn't you like to know.

146
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:08,582
- Mmm.

147
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:10,484
Yeah, very true.

148
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:11,886
Fair point.

149
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,954
- Have you seen Hunter?

150
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:16,123
- Darlene, why would
we want him here?

151
00:09:16,157 --> 00:09:17,925
- We're paying him enough.

152
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,960
- We put him in a
cabin in the woods

153
00:09:19,994 --> 00:09:21,829
so the other campers
wouldn't see him.

154
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:23,130
- Well, have you seen him?

155
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:24,999
- No, but we've exchanged texts.

156
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:26,233
You gotta calm down.

157
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:28,002
Look, everything is
set for tonight, okay?

158
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:29,670
It's all in place.

159
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:31,038
- No, it better be.

160
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:33,240
We sunk a lot of money
into this damn camp!

161
00:09:51,526 --> 00:09:54,563
- And that's why we're
here tonight, campers,

162
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:59,600
for the Camp Echo Lake
Camp of Terror experience.

163
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,003
- They don't wanna
hear that shit!

164
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,107
Get to the good stuff.

165
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,208
- What's that, Mike?

166
00:10:08,577 --> 00:10:11,546
- The story of what happened
to the Meadows family

167
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,783
20 years ago, the
kidnapping, little Echo,

168
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:19,253
and the brutal murder
of her parents,

169
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,188
John and Ruby.

170
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:25,359
- Tell us the rest of the story!

171
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,495
- Yeah, that's why we're here!

172
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:30,064
- We paid extra money to
be the first campers here.

173
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,632
- Yeah, a lotta money!

174
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:32,666
- Give us some excitement!

175
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,068
- And it better be scary.

176
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:35,269
- Okay.

177
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,437
Okay.

178
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,372
But you asked for it.

179
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:39,541
So here goes.

180
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:50,484
The story supposedly
says that 20 years ago,

181
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:57,091
on this exact night,
Halloween weekend in 2002.

182
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:38,832
- What are you humming, Big Sis?

183
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:40,034
- My favorite song.

184
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,936
It drowns out their arguing.

185
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:44,138
- I know you don't like
it when they argue.

186
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:47,942
Mom and Dad are going to
camp this weekend, too.

187
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:48,876
Grownup camp.

188
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,345
- Wanna see my costume?

189
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:56,518
- So what are you
supposed to be?

190
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,621
- This year for Halloween,

191
00:11:59,654 --> 00:12:01,288
I'm going to be happy.

192
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,659
- I think I'm gonna
be a werewolf!

193
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:07,928
- I've gotta show Mom and Dad.

194
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:12,933
- John, this is my last
go at this marriage.

195
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:14,134
If you want it to work,

196
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:16,538
you're gonna take this
retreat seriously.

197
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:17,805
I mean it this time, okay?

198
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,039
I...

199
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:21,475
- Mommy, Daddy, just be happy!

200
00:12:22,644 --> 00:12:25,312
I thought you weren't
going to argue anymore.

201
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:26,146
- See, John.

202
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:29,283
I told you the
children could hear us.

203
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:32,152
- Just let me handle this.

204
00:12:34,556 --> 00:12:38,025
Sweetie, Mommy and
Daddy were not arguing.

205
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:39,893
We were talking about
how excited we are

206
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,730
for adult camp this weekend!

207
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,097
- Why are you so loud then?

208
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:45,833
My friends at school said

209
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:49,638
you and Mommy are going
to get a separation.

210
00:12:56,745 --> 00:12:58,445
- It's called a divorce, honey.

211
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,616
Don't worry.

212
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,718
Me and your father
love each other dearly.

213
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,253
Right, hun?

214
00:13:11,593 --> 00:13:12,960
Now, why don't you go
finish getting ready, okay?

215
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:14,428
We're gonna leave in 30 minutes.

216
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,167
- Hey!

217
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,969
You forgetting someone?

218
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:22,870
Where's my hug?

219
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:27,308
Did you help your little brother
pick out his costume yet?

220
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:29,143
- Jasper, I have
to go help Jasper!

221
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:30,545
- Yes, you heard your mother,

222
00:13:30,578 --> 00:13:32,212
we leave in 30 minutes!

223
00:13:34,716 --> 00:13:36,884
Be happy, my little princess!

224
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:38,620
- Jasper, Jasper,
come on, get ready.

225
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:39,754
We're going to camp!

226
00:14:10,652 --> 00:14:13,087
- Dammit, Ruby, you
missed the turn!

227
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,955
We're gonna run outta gas now!

228
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:17,291
I told you to get gas
at the last rest stop!

229
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:20,060
Now, we're gonna be stranded
in the middle of nowhere!

230
00:14:20,094 --> 00:14:22,196
- Quiet, John, you're
gonna wake the kids.

231
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:25,899
- Just get out and
let me drive, Ruby!

232
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:28,035
- I'm not getting out
and waking the kids.

233
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,839
There has to be a gas station
around here somewhere.

234
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:32,841
We're only 10 miles
away from the camp.

235
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:36,143
- I really wish you would
just listen to me, Ruby.

236
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:38,212
- John, stop fighting with me!

237
00:14:39,614 --> 00:14:41,415
I thought you wanted this
relationship to work.

238
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:44,786
We need to be a good
example to our kids.

239
00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:47,421
Let's just get a bite to
eat, find a gas station,

240
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,022
then drop the kids off at camp.

241
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,694
Then we'll go to
marriage counseling,

242
00:14:52,727 --> 00:14:55,028
and see if we can
make this work.

243
00:15:00,535 --> 00:15:01,368
- Fine.

244
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,158
- May I be excused?

245
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:26,026
I need to use the bathroom.

246
00:15:28,897 --> 00:15:30,397
- Go with her.

247
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:32,767
I'll stay here with Jasper
and take care of the bill.

248
00:15:34,536 --> 00:15:35,637
- I'm a big girl, Dad.

249
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,371
I don't need Mom to go with me.

250
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:42,242
- Go with her.

251
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:57,391
So little buddy, you
excited for camp?

252
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:59,159
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

253
00:15:59,193 --> 00:16:00,862
Well, finish your lunch, okay?

254
00:16:00,895 --> 00:16:01,696
I'm gonna go pay the bill.

255
00:16:01,729 --> 00:16:02,664
I'll be right back.

256
00:16:28,523 --> 00:16:29,958
- Did you wash your hands, Echo?

257
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,258
- Yes, Mom.

258
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,460
- Okay, Jasper and
Daddy are waiting.

259
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:34,328
Let's go.

260
00:16:42,604 --> 00:16:43,538
- Where's, Echo?

261
00:16:43,571 --> 00:16:45,339
- Right behind me.

262
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:46,608
- I don't see her, Mommy.

263
00:16:48,843 --> 00:16:50,077
- Jesus Christ,
you left her inside

264
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,478
the bathroom alone
again, didn't you?

265
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:53,046
- She was right behind me.

266
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,431
- Stay with Jasper.

267
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:28,683
- That's my favorite.

268
00:17:32,687 --> 00:17:33,521
- You want it?

269
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:35,990
- I'll be
right back, Son.

270
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:36,891
- Okay, Dad.

271
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,797
- But my parents said
I can't have any candy

272
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,666
until Halloween night.

273
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,504
- Listen, my name's Lou,

274
00:17:49,537 --> 00:17:50,470
and I work here.

275
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,909
I don't see anybody around
us right now, do you?

276
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:57,177
- Echo?

277
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,079
Echo, sweetie, where are you?

278
00:17:59,981 --> 00:18:00,782
- That's my dad.

279
00:18:00,815 --> 00:18:02,416
I better go, Lou.

280
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:03,283
- Hey.

281
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:06,921
You save this for later, okay?

282
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:12,060
My sweet little princess, okay?

283
00:18:14,896 --> 00:18:17,765
- What have I told you
about talking to strangers?

284
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,366
- But, but-
- No.

285
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:22,336
- Sir, she wasn't
talking to a stranger.

286
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:23,538
My name's Lou.

287
00:18:23,571 --> 00:18:24,839
I work here.

288
00:18:24,872 --> 00:18:26,206
- All right, thank you,

289
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,474
but we really gotta go.

290
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:28,442
We're gonna be late for camp.

291
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:29,476
Thanks.

292
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,979
- Camp?

293
00:18:31,012 --> 00:18:31,846
Which camp?

294
00:18:34,082 --> 00:18:35,917
- Yeah, I
forget the name of it.

295
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:36,751
- Camp Pleasant Lake, Lou.

296
00:18:36,784 --> 00:18:38,251
It's the Halloween camp.

297
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:40,855
- Sorry, we gotta go.

298
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:41,756
Thanks again.

299
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:47,227
- You're lucky.

300
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:50,364
My boy, Lou, here is a good man.

301
00:18:51,766 --> 00:18:54,134
Next person comin'
along might not be.

302
00:18:56,738 --> 00:18:59,007
Keep an eye on your
little girl now, ya hear?

303
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:03,343
- Ouch, that hurts, Daddy.

304
00:19:03,377 --> 00:19:04,579
- Let's go.

305
00:19:04,612 --> 00:19:06,114
Now, we're definitely
gonna be late for camp.

306
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:22,462
- Yes, sir.

307
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:25,432
- And I want my
goddamn belt back.

308
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:26,567
You give me that back-

309
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:28,836
Yo, yo, excuse me, sir!

310
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:29,704
Watch it mister!

311
00:19:29,737 --> 00:19:30,538
- Sorry, apologies.

312
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:31,405
Didn't see you.

313
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:33,206
- Okay, that's fine.

314
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,076
- Thanks.
- There you go.

315
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:38,680
- Some folks don't take too
kindly to be bumped into.

316
00:19:38,713 --> 00:19:40,180
- Better keep an eye

317
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:42,984
on your little girl next
time, too, huh?

318
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:45,653
- Let's go.

319
00:19:45,687 --> 00:19:46,554
Now!

320
00:19:46,587 --> 00:19:47,822
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

321
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:49,657
That's no way to
speak to your wife.

322
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,727
- Not nice at all.

323
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,896
- We's nice around here.

324
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,032
- Very nice.
- Watch out

325
00:19:58,066 --> 00:20:00,267
for that little girl

326
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,503
and that little boy.

327
00:20:02,537 --> 00:20:05,305
- Better watch out
for that one there.

328
00:20:13,114 --> 00:20:14,347
- Move, please.

329
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:17,118
Get out of our way!

330
00:20:19,754 --> 00:20:21,889
- They're right, mister.

331
00:20:21,923 --> 00:20:24,424
The next person
may not be so nice.

332
00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:27,461
- You aren't that nice.

333
00:20:30,131 --> 00:20:31,799
- Is that so?

334
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:35,937
- You don't know what you're
talking about, little boy.

335
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:38,438
- Hey, kids,

336
00:20:38,472 --> 00:20:42,710
some children are better
to be seen than heard.

337
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:48,315
- Good thing we raised
our boy right here.

338
00:20:51,953 --> 00:20:52,754
Not like you!

339
00:20:54,122 --> 00:20:55,923
- Dad raised us right!

340
00:20:59,493 --> 00:21:01,963
- What's your name, little man?

341
00:21:01,996 --> 00:21:02,930
- I'm Jasper.

342
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:09,737
This is my sister, Echo.

343
00:21:10,805 --> 00:21:13,775
- Aren't you a cutie pie?

344
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:17,211
- Just move out of our way.

345
00:21:17,245 --> 00:21:18,646
We really need to get going.

346
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:22,482
- Dad, that hurts!

347
00:21:22,517 --> 00:21:24,051
- Treat 'em right.

348
00:21:24,085 --> 00:21:26,486
They won't be around forever.

349
00:21:26,521 --> 00:21:28,122
- Come on, go, go, let's go.

350
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:42,369
- Tim, be a dear,

351
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:45,006
and get the sheriff
on the phone for me.

352
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,274
- Yes, ma'am, right away!

353
00:21:48,543 --> 00:21:49,877
- You know what to do.

354
00:21:54,447 --> 00:21:55,817
- Yes, Esmeralda.

355
00:21:59,153 --> 00:22:02,590
- Oh, Ezra, it'll be worth it.

356
00:22:07,662 --> 00:22:09,030
- The sheriff's on the line.

357
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,235
- Sheriff Dean here.

358
00:22:14,268 --> 00:22:15,970
- It Esmeralda.

359
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:16,971
- Always a pleasure.

360
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:18,105
What can I do for you?

361
00:22:19,073 --> 00:22:20,340
- Lou's following a family

362
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:22,944
of city slickers
straight into camp.

363
00:22:24,278 --> 00:22:26,147
You know what to do.

364
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:26,981
- Say no more.

365
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:28,716
I'll keep him covered.

366
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,855
- Thank you, Tim.

367
00:22:33,888 --> 00:22:35,289
- Yes, Esmeralda.

368
00:23:41,322 --> 00:23:43,124
- Jasper, wake up.

369
00:23:43,157 --> 00:23:44,759
We're at camp, sweetie.

370
00:23:54,135 --> 00:23:54,969
Go.

371
00:23:57,505 --> 00:23:58,406
Go ahead, honey.

372
00:23:58,438 --> 00:23:59,206
It's only for the weekend.

373
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,241
We'll see you on Monday.

374
00:24:05,913 --> 00:24:07,148
Take my phone.

375
00:24:07,181 --> 00:24:09,050
I'll call you tonight
from Daddy's phone.

376
00:24:16,524 --> 00:24:17,558
- Hello!

377
00:24:17,591 --> 00:24:19,492
Welcome to Camp Pleasant Lake!

378
00:24:19,527 --> 00:24:21,128
I'm Mr. Corbin.

379
00:24:21,162 --> 00:24:22,630
- Hi, I'm Jasper.

380
00:24:22,663 --> 00:24:23,764
I'm a werewolf for Halloween.

381
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:26,233
- That's a great
costume, Jasper!

382
00:24:27,702 --> 00:24:28,502
- Nice.

383
00:24:28,536 --> 00:24:30,137
- Cool costume!

384
00:24:30,171 --> 00:24:32,006
- And I'm his
older sister, Echo.

385
00:24:33,441 --> 00:24:34,575
- Where's your costume?

386
00:24:37,845 --> 00:24:39,780
What is that supposed to be?

387
00:24:39,814 --> 00:24:40,715
- Happy.

388
00:24:42,016 --> 00:24:43,150
- That's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

389
00:24:43,184 --> 00:24:44,685
- What an idiot!

390
00:24:47,021 --> 00:24:48,622
- Look
at me, I'm happy!

391
00:24:48,656 --> 00:24:50,490
- You have a problem with that?

392
00:24:57,365 --> 00:24:59,100
- What a loser!

393
00:24:59,133 --> 00:25:00,468
- Loser!
- Loser!

394
00:25:03,304 --> 00:25:05,906
- Don't worry
about these losers.

395
00:25:06,874 --> 00:25:08,042
- There she goes!

396
00:25:10,044 --> 00:25:11,612
Aren't you supposed to be happy?

397
00:25:12,913 --> 00:25:16,217
- Oh, you're
gonna cry to your mommy?

398
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,319
- Look at him!

399
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:35,002
- Stupid mask!

400
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:39,673
Nobody wants to
hang out with me.

401
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,859
It's you, the, the, the...

402
00:26:01,896 --> 00:26:03,697
- The man from the restaurant.

403
00:26:04,732 --> 00:26:06,867
I'm Ezra, Lou's father.

404
00:26:07,902 --> 00:26:08,736
- You work here?

405
00:26:09,637 --> 00:26:10,704
- Hmm, uh-uh.

406
00:26:12,473 --> 00:26:14,442
I work at Camp Hope.

407
00:26:17,311 --> 00:26:19,280
- The other kids were
making fun of me.

408
00:26:20,181 --> 00:26:21,315
I hate it here!

409
00:26:26,521 --> 00:26:27,755
- There's that smile.

410
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,294
You know what?

411
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:37,264
My camp's right down the road.

412
00:26:37,298 --> 00:26:38,399
Lou's there, too.

413
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:45,906
- I like Lou.

414
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,774
He gave me this.

415
00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:49,009
It's my favorite.

416
00:26:49,043 --> 00:26:50,444
- Well, that's a good thing,

417
00:26:51,812 --> 00:26:53,848
'cause there's a whole
bunch more of it at my camp.

418
00:26:55,015 --> 00:26:55,816
You wanna go?

419
00:26:56,684 --> 00:26:57,519
- Yeah!

420
00:26:58,652 --> 00:27:00,387
Wait, where's Jasper?

421
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,658
I don't wanna forget about him.

422
00:27:04,692 --> 00:27:06,327
- We won't forget about Jasper.

423
00:27:07,495 --> 00:27:08,896
We'll come back and get him.

424
00:27:09,864 --> 00:27:10,698
I,

425
00:27:11,832 --> 00:27:12,633
I...

426
00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:13,467
- Promise?

427
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:14,335
- I promise.

428
00:27:16,704 --> 00:27:17,972
- Okay.

429
00:27:18,005 --> 00:27:19,874
The kids don't like
me here anyway.

430
00:27:19,907 --> 00:27:21,408
They broke my costume.

431
00:27:24,546 --> 00:27:25,412
- That's a shame.

432
00:27:26,847 --> 00:27:27,848
But it's all right.

433
00:27:28,983 --> 00:27:31,118
We're gonna make you
another one at my camp.

434
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,855
- Okay, let's go then.

435
00:27:34,889 --> 00:27:36,525
- Boys, boys, break it up!

436
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:37,491
- Say that again!

437
00:27:37,526 --> 00:27:38,527
- She's a freak!

438
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,460
- That's enough, guys!

439
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:40,327
Come on!

440
00:27:43,797 --> 00:27:44,633
- Where's Echo?

441
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:47,935
- Looks like she
finally found a friend.

442
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,639
- Echo!

443
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:51,506
Echo!

444
00:27:52,406 --> 00:27:53,774
Echo!

445
00:27:53,807 --> 00:27:54,643
Echo!

446
00:28:04,251 --> 00:28:07,054
- And little Echo Meadows

447
00:28:07,087 --> 00:28:11,392
was never seen or
heard from again.

448
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,762
- And rumor has it,

449
00:28:14,795 --> 00:28:17,566
Echo still roams these woods.

450
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:20,301
- I heard she comes back

451
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:24,238
every Halloween looking for him.

452
00:28:24,271 --> 00:28:25,674
And if we're lucky,

453
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:30,044
she'll come back tonight.

454
00:28:30,077 --> 00:28:31,245
- I love this shit!

455
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:32,880
- Shit, me, too!

456
00:28:32,913 --> 00:28:36,551
- Wait, you don't actually
think this shit is real, do you?

457
00:28:36,585 --> 00:28:38,052
- Come on, man.

458
00:28:38,085 --> 00:28:40,054
The Rutherfords made this
shit up just to make a buck.

459
00:28:40,087 --> 00:28:41,755
- What happened to him?

460
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:43,090
- What happened to who?

461
00:28:45,226 --> 00:28:46,427
- Echo's little brother.

462
00:28:48,162 --> 00:28:49,230
What happened to him?

463
00:28:49,263 --> 00:28:53,901
- Neither him or his sister

464
00:28:53,934 --> 00:28:55,736
was ever seen again.

465
00:28:57,838 --> 00:28:58,806
What?

466
00:28:59,674 --> 00:29:00,542
You asked what happened.

467
00:29:02,209 --> 00:29:03,010
- Hoo!

468
00:29:03,043 --> 00:29:04,345
Hoo, hoo!

469
00:29:04,378 --> 00:29:05,779
- The fuck's wrong with you?

470
00:29:05,813 --> 00:29:07,081
- He probably wasn't
hugged enough as a child.

471
00:29:21,962 --> 00:29:22,863
- Camp of Terror,

472
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:28,369
you really wanna
know the real story?

473
00:29:28,402 --> 00:29:30,037
- Yeah!
- Of course!

474
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,238
- Now, the legend goes,

475
00:29:32,406 --> 00:29:35,610
that Echo Meadows was kidnapped

476
00:29:35,644 --> 00:29:37,646
by a very evil man,

477
00:29:39,013 --> 00:29:41,882
because that evil man
and his wife, Esmeralda,

478
00:29:41,915 --> 00:29:44,018
desperately wanted
a little girl,

479
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:47,321
but they just couldn't get one.

480
00:29:47,354 --> 00:29:48,822
So-

481
00:29:48,856 --> 00:29:53,060
- So then, when John and
Ruby Meadows left the camp,

482
00:29:53,927 --> 00:29:56,397
they were brutally murdered,

483
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:59,233
and the killer was never found!

484
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:04,271
Locals say Echo
returns every Halloween

485
00:30:05,372 --> 00:30:07,841
to these woods
looking for family.

486
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:08,710
And

487
00:30:09,943 --> 00:30:11,579
- If you get in her way,

488
00:30:11,613 --> 00:30:13,981
she will slash you,

489
00:30:14,014 --> 00:30:16,250
and leave you with a sad,

490
00:30:16,283 --> 00:30:18,720
bloody frown on your face!

491
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,692
- So then you can
feel the same pain

492
00:30:23,725 --> 00:30:25,125
she once did!

493
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:26,594
- When does the terror start?

494
00:30:26,628 --> 00:30:27,461
- Tomorrow!

495
00:30:28,763 --> 00:30:30,632
So you may all want
to turn in soon,

496
00:30:30,665 --> 00:30:32,199
and get a good night's sleep.

497
00:30:32,232 --> 00:30:36,303
- Actually, the terror has
already started tonight.

498
00:30:37,471 --> 00:30:42,076
Supposedly, Echo
Meadows went wandering

499
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:45,179
in the forest the night
that she was kidnapped,

500
00:30:45,212 --> 00:30:49,016
the very same night that her
parents were brutally murdered.

501
00:30:50,217 --> 00:30:51,919
- Any camper that
gets in her way,

502
00:30:51,952 --> 00:30:53,354
well, you know.

503
00:30:55,022 --> 00:30:58,859
- Now, you wanted the extra
Camp of Terror experience.

504
00:30:58,892 --> 00:31:00,861
Well, you have got it!

505
00:31:00,894 --> 00:31:02,597
With the VIP experience,

506
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:06,367
you will be the first
campers to relive the horror

507
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,037
that happened that
night 20 years ago,

508
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,072
right here, right now,

509
00:31:12,106 --> 00:31:14,174
in the all new Camp of Terror!

510
00:31:21,448 --> 00:31:24,786
- And how 'bout
that interview now?

511
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:26,954
- No, sorry, Jonah.

512
00:31:26,987 --> 00:31:27,822
- I see.

513
00:31:28,989 --> 00:31:30,457
- Grab the original crew.

514
00:31:30,491 --> 00:31:32,192
Let's meet at the
tunnel in a bit.

515
00:31:32,226 --> 00:31:33,060
- I got you.

516
00:31:41,603 --> 00:31:42,804
- Whoa, what's that?

517
00:31:42,837 --> 00:31:44,471
- This place looks awesome!

518
00:31:44,506 --> 00:31:46,039
- Wonder how long
it's been here?

519
00:31:47,207 --> 00:31:48,810
- What,
tryin' to scare us?

520
00:31:48,843 --> 00:31:49,744
- Is this
part of the camp?

521
00:31:49,778 --> 00:31:50,879
- Are you ready?

522
00:31:51,813 --> 00:31:53,313
- Let's act surprised.

523
00:31:53,347 --> 00:31:55,850
We gotta put on a really
good show for the campers.

524
00:31:55,884 --> 00:31:57,251
- Let's do this!

525
00:32:00,154 --> 00:32:01,790
Let's hear you, man!

526
00:32:02,724 --> 00:32:03,991
You guys wanted a show.

527
00:32:11,766 --> 00:32:14,968
- You all wanted the Camp
of Terror experience?

528
00:32:15,002 --> 00:32:17,906
Well, here you go!

529
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:19,039
Hurry!

530
00:32:19,072 --> 00:32:20,809
- Let's go!

531
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,181
- We all saw what happened.

532
00:32:27,214 --> 00:32:28,415
- We didn't know she
was being kidnapped.

533
00:32:28,449 --> 00:32:29,450
It's not our fault.

534
00:32:30,718 --> 00:32:32,720
Echo!

535
00:32:32,754 --> 00:32:34,254
- I'm his big sister, Echo.

536
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:35,189
- What an idiot!

537
00:32:36,256 --> 00:32:37,357
- She's a freak!

538
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:47,034
Aren't you supposed to be happy?

539
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,539
- Echo!

540
00:32:51,573 --> 00:32:52,740
- Look at him!

541
00:32:53,608 --> 00:32:54,843
- Echo!

542
00:32:54,876 --> 00:32:56,343
Echo!

543
00:32:56,376 --> 00:32:57,779
- Jacob's right.

544
00:32:57,812 --> 00:32:59,781
We all saw what happened,

545
00:32:59,814 --> 00:33:01,181
and did nothing about it.

546
00:33:01,215 --> 00:33:03,250
- We had our chance
when the cops came.

547
00:33:03,283 --> 00:33:04,919
- They asked us if
we saw anything.

548
00:33:04,953 --> 00:33:06,821
- And we all said no.

549
00:33:06,855 --> 00:33:08,523
- We-
- Should've told the cops

550
00:33:08,556 --> 00:33:09,524
what we saw!

551
00:33:09,557 --> 00:33:10,892
- But we kept our mouths shut!

552
00:33:10,925 --> 00:33:12,459
- Look, we're all
in this together.

553
00:33:12,493 --> 00:33:15,597
- We stick to our
original story.

554
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,331
We saw nothing.

555
00:33:17,364 --> 00:33:18,198
Got it?

556
00:33:20,067 --> 00:33:20,869
- Who's that?

557
00:33:20,902 --> 00:33:21,803
Who's there?

558
00:33:21,836 --> 00:33:22,537
- "Who's that, who's there?"

559
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,470
Calm down, dude!

560
00:33:23,505 --> 00:33:24,706
You're always freakin' out.

561
00:33:24,739 --> 00:33:26,006
It's probably nothin'.

562
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:28,175
- That, or...
- Echo Meadows!

563
00:33:30,244 --> 00:33:31,144
- Stop it.

564
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:32,045
- What's the matter, Jacob?

565
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,548
You scared?

566
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:36,618
- In all seriousness,

567
00:33:36,651 --> 00:33:39,386
the Rutherfords are payin'
us good money for this,

568
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:42,222
so let's give those
campers what they came for,

569
00:33:42,256 --> 00:33:44,057
a weekend of terror!

570
00:33:44,091 --> 00:33:45,325
- And remember,
starting tomorrow,

571
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:48,228
we will all be getting
killed off one by one.

572
00:33:48,262 --> 00:33:50,063
The Rutherfords will
be telling the campers

573
00:33:50,097 --> 00:33:51,699
Echo took us all.

574
00:33:51,733 --> 00:33:54,334
- And that's why they won't
be seein' our dead bodies.

575
00:33:54,368 --> 00:33:56,804
We meet back at the
counselor's lodge on Monday,

576
00:33:56,838 --> 00:34:00,173
Halloween morning, and
do it all over again

577
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:01,743
for a new batch of campers.

578
00:34:01,776 --> 00:34:03,210
- It's easy money for everyone.

579
00:34:03,243 --> 00:34:05,445
- Now, let's get back to
our tents and get some rest.

580
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:07,815
It's gonna be a
long, bloody weekend!

581
00:34:46,054 --> 00:34:49,057
- Ahh, fuck!

582
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:51,291
Ow, what the fuck?

583
00:34:51,325 --> 00:34:53,528
I thought this shit was
supposed to be fake?

584
00:35:09,644 --> 00:35:10,845
This isn't funny!

585
00:35:10,878 --> 00:35:12,412
What the fuck, Hunter?

586
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,534
Ugh!

587
00:35:45,445 --> 00:35:47,381
- I guess
Jacob is still bent

588
00:35:47,414 --> 00:35:48,448
from last night, huh?

589
00:35:50,051 --> 00:35:51,819
- Maybe he's hung over.

590
00:35:51,853 --> 00:35:53,087
- I'm surprised.

591
00:35:53,121 --> 00:35:54,956
His big ass never
misses breakfast.

592
00:35:57,925 --> 00:35:59,761
- Let's go wake his lazy ass up.

593
00:35:59,794 --> 00:36:01,663
- Like Mike said, we're all
in this together, right?

594
00:36:01,696 --> 00:36:02,764
- Right.

595
00:36:02,797 --> 00:36:03,598
Let's go.

596
00:36:16,044 --> 00:36:18,646
Oh.

597
00:36:26,954 --> 00:36:28,990
Guess you got axed
first, huh, buddy?

598
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:32,794
Hey, come check this out.

599
00:36:43,037 --> 00:36:44,138
- Wow, it looks like

600
00:36:44,172 --> 00:36:45,907
the Rutherfords started
the party early.

601
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,508
- This looks fake.

602
00:36:47,542 --> 00:36:49,577
We need to tell the Rutherfords
to make it look more real.

603
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,311
- It's not too bad!

604
00:36:51,344 --> 00:36:53,346
- The Rutherfords are
cheap as hell, man!

605
00:36:55,348 --> 00:36:56,651
- What do you think, Mike?

606
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,387
- Remember what the
Rutherfords said,

607
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,557
"They're gonna make it
look as real as possible."

608
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,959
These campers paid good
money for this shit.

609
00:37:07,195 --> 00:37:09,664
Hey, what are you doin' here?

610
00:37:09,697 --> 00:37:10,965
This is the counselors'
campgrounds.

611
00:37:10,998 --> 00:37:13,300
You should be with
the other campers.

612
00:37:17,437 --> 00:37:19,674
- Mike, Mike, did you see this?

613
00:37:19,707 --> 00:37:21,776
This Hunter did great work, huh?

614
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:22,977
- Who?

615
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,512
- Hunter, the guy we hired

616
00:37:24,545 --> 00:37:26,848
to do the special effects
that would look so great.

617
00:37:26,881 --> 00:37:28,683
- Not in front of
the other campers.

618
00:37:29,884 --> 00:37:31,284
- What are you talking about?
- What the?

619
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:33,187
That little fucker
was just here.

620
00:37:33,221 --> 00:37:34,122
- Who, who are
you talkin' about?

621
00:37:34,155 --> 00:37:35,857
- That weird camper, he was.

622
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:36,724
Nevermind.

623
00:37:38,526 --> 00:37:41,696
So who's gonna get it next?

624
00:38:14,595 --> 00:38:17,297
- Who the fuck are you?

625
00:38:31,612 --> 00:38:32,445
Fuck.

626
00:38:39,654 --> 00:38:40,922
Jesus Christ.

627
00:38:55,203 --> 00:38:56,003
Ugh!

628
00:38:56,037 --> 00:38:57,205
What the fuck?

629
00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:02,143
Huh?

630
00:39:21,696 --> 00:39:22,530
Mom? Dad?

631
00:39:26,901 --> 00:39:27,735
Dad?

632
00:39:33,241 --> 00:39:35,910
Where the fuck did you get that?

633
00:39:39,013 --> 00:39:40,014
Who are you?

634
00:39:48,122 --> 00:39:48,956
Ugh!

635
00:40:01,969 --> 00:40:04,238
- I heard Jacob got it first.

636
00:40:04,272 --> 00:40:05,373
- Which one was Jacob?

637
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:07,074
- You know, the chubby one.

638
00:40:07,108 --> 00:40:07,942
- Oh, that guy.

639
00:40:09,442 --> 00:40:10,611
Yeah.

640
00:40:10,645 --> 00:40:12,713
- So how long you think
it took to kill him?

641
00:40:12,747 --> 00:40:14,048
- Shit, long enough.

642
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:15,448
I mean, he probably
tried to talk

643
00:40:15,482 --> 00:40:16,884
the killer's ear off first.

644
00:40:16,918 --> 00:40:17,718
- Seriously.

645
00:40:17,752 --> 00:40:19,120
- This is bullshit.

646
00:40:19,153 --> 00:40:20,922
We didn't even get to
see any of the carnage.

647
00:40:20,955 --> 00:40:22,924
- Yeah, I mean, we
paid extra for this.

648
00:40:22,957 --> 00:40:24,358
- They should have come got us.

649
00:40:24,392 --> 00:40:26,160
- Look, why don't you guys

650
00:40:26,193 --> 00:40:28,829
just enjoy your lunch
and stop complaining.

651
00:40:28,863 --> 00:40:29,797
Nobody wants to hear it.

652
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,332
- Fuckin'.
- This guy.

653
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:33,968
- Yeah, what is wrong?

654
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:36,671
- Yeah, we paid good money for
this horror camp experience.

655
00:40:37,672 --> 00:40:39,807
- Just give us what we want!

656
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,442
- We wanna see.
- We wanna see blood!

657
00:40:42,475 --> 00:40:43,711
Blood!

658
00:40:43,744 --> 00:40:46,681
- People, please,
take it easy here.

659
00:40:46,714 --> 00:40:49,116
I can hear you arguing all
the way down the trail.

660
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:52,119
- Why didn't you come get
us when you offed Jacob?

661
00:40:52,153 --> 00:40:54,188
- Jacob was a, was
a bonus, right?

662
00:40:54,221 --> 00:40:55,156
- Yeah.

663
00:40:55,189 --> 00:40:56,824
- Correct me if I'm wrong,

664
00:40:56,857 --> 00:40:59,393
an unforgettable, most brutal,

665
00:40:59,427 --> 00:41:02,063
horrifying Camp of
Terror experience.

666
00:41:02,096 --> 00:41:03,297
- Right?
- Yeah.

667
00:41:03,331 --> 00:41:06,100
You kinda forgot the
bloody, horrifying part.

668
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:08,235
- We wanted to see Jacob get it.

669
00:41:08,269 --> 00:41:10,671
- Yeah, not be told about
a fake pool of blood.

670
00:41:10,705 --> 00:41:12,840
- Yeah, we didn't
even know how he died.

671
00:41:13,908 --> 00:41:15,943
- Rick, give us what we want.

672
00:41:15,977 --> 00:41:18,012
- We want what you promised!

673
00:41:18,045 --> 00:41:19,947
- Yeah, the Camp of
Terror experience.

674
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:24,051
- Are you ripping us off?

675
00:41:24,085 --> 00:41:25,853
- What's going on Mr.
and Mrs. Rutherford?

676
00:41:25,886 --> 00:41:27,487
- No, come on, please, people.

677
00:41:27,521 --> 00:41:30,391
Look, today is gonna be epic.

678
00:41:30,424 --> 00:41:33,361
I promise you we are
gonna have blood, okay?

679
00:41:35,062 --> 00:41:36,697
What happened with Hunter?

680
00:41:36,731 --> 00:41:39,133
He didn't even tell me
he was gonna off Jacob.

681
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:41,369
That was scheduled for today.

682
00:41:41,402 --> 00:41:43,504
- I just saw someone
over by the fire pit.

683
00:41:44,605 --> 00:41:46,007
Looks like they're setting up.

684
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,676
- You again, the weird camper.

685
00:41:48,709 --> 00:41:49,543
What do you want?

686
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:58,519
- It's only day two
a shit show.

687
00:41:58,552 --> 00:42:00,054
- Listen, I'm gonna
go check on Hunter.

688
00:42:00,087 --> 00:42:02,156
You get them all excited
about tonight, all right?

689
00:42:02,189 --> 00:42:04,959
- Tell Hunter if
he fucks up again,

690
00:42:04,992 --> 00:42:06,560
I'll be the one killing his ass.

691
00:42:08,095 --> 00:42:09,964
Okay, campers, listen.

692
00:42:09,997 --> 00:42:12,033
- Hey, how about
that interview now?

693
00:42:12,066 --> 00:42:15,504
- Sorry, Jonah, I need to
get the campers excited.

694
00:42:15,536 --> 00:42:17,471
You wanna see blood, campers?

695
00:42:17,506 --> 00:42:18,339
- Yeah.
- Yes.

696
00:42:19,907 --> 00:42:20,908
- Now you're
going to get it.

697
00:42:20,941 --> 00:42:22,243
- Can I quote you on that?

698
00:42:23,677 --> 00:42:27,014
- Go back to your
cabins and get ready.

699
00:42:27,048 --> 00:42:30,451
We meet at the fire
pit in two hours.

700
00:42:30,484 --> 00:42:31,452
Okay?

701
00:42:31,485 --> 00:42:33,187
Let's go.
- Hell, yeah!

702
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:36,223
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

703
00:42:48,502 --> 00:42:50,671
- Hey, you okay?

704
00:42:56,877 --> 00:42:57,711
What's wrong?

705
00:43:01,715 --> 00:43:03,984
- I don't like when the
campers make fun of me.

706
00:43:05,286 --> 00:43:06,353
- Who made fun of you?

707
00:43:07,388 --> 00:43:08,722
Who are you talking about?

708
00:43:14,462 --> 00:43:15,763
- All of you.

709
00:43:20,868 --> 00:43:23,003
- I heard what Mike
said to you back there.

710
00:43:24,004 --> 00:43:24,972
Don't listen to him.

711
00:43:25,005 --> 00:43:26,006
He's an asshole.

712
00:43:30,311 --> 00:43:31,378
What's your name?

713
00:43:31,412 --> 00:43:32,980
I'm Gracie-
- You were part of it.

714
00:43:53,067 --> 00:43:54,668
- I could kill Hunter right now.

715
00:43:57,071 --> 00:44:00,542
I can't believe that little
prick screwed us over like this!

716
00:44:05,212 --> 00:44:08,082
You told me that he
was top notch, Darlene.

717
00:44:08,115 --> 00:44:10,784
- He came highly recommended
on their company site.

718
00:44:10,818 --> 00:44:12,286
- Well, we have no killer now.

719
00:44:13,387 --> 00:44:15,089
And no killer means
angry campers.

720
00:44:15,122 --> 00:44:17,358
And angry campers means refunds.

721
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:24,798
Every camper paid $10,000
to be here this weekend.

722
00:44:24,832 --> 00:44:28,002
And we have a whole nother bunch
of 'em coming in on Monday.

723
00:44:28,035 --> 00:44:29,837
We're gonna lose a ton of money,

724
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:31,305
and I don't like to lose.

725
00:44:32,173 --> 00:44:33,608
- I called the company,

726
00:44:33,642 --> 00:44:34,808
and they said they're
trying to send someone out

727
00:44:34,842 --> 00:44:36,043
as soon as possible.

728
00:44:36,076 --> 00:44:37,244
- Darlene, it's
Halloween weekend.

729
00:44:37,278 --> 00:44:39,680
They're all booked,
for God's sake!

730
00:44:41,215 --> 00:44:43,585
Now, all these campers
are gonna gather here

731
00:44:43,618 --> 00:44:45,920
in an hour and 30 minutes.

732
00:44:45,953 --> 00:44:47,254
We have to figure
out something fast,

733
00:44:47,288 --> 00:44:48,623
or we are fucked!

734
00:44:49,857 --> 00:44:51,526
I'd put on the Echo
costume myself,

735
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,960
but I'm not five five, dear.

736
00:44:53,928 --> 00:44:55,095
- You.

737
00:44:55,129 --> 00:44:56,130
- Oh, please.

738
00:45:10,844 --> 00:45:12,913
- Mrs. Rutherford.
- Yeah, yeah, hold on.

739
00:45:15,115 --> 00:45:16,717
- How's your husband?

740
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:17,652
- Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

741
00:45:17,686 --> 00:45:19,119
- He's late like usual.

742
00:45:19,153 --> 00:45:20,854
- Yeah, what's going on?

743
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:22,489
- This is supposed to
be a camp of terror.

744
00:45:22,524 --> 00:45:24,892
- Yeah, not a camp
of nightmares.

745
00:45:24,925 --> 00:45:26,860
- I wouldn't call
any of this terror.

746
00:45:26,894 --> 00:45:28,862
- It's been more like
camp of nap time.

747
00:45:30,231 --> 00:45:31,832
- Camp of nap time.

748
00:45:33,367 --> 00:45:34,468
I like that.

749
00:45:34,501 --> 00:45:37,137
- So Mrs. Rutherford,
where is your-

750
00:45:37,171 --> 00:45:38,607
- He'll be here soon.

751
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,674
Don't worry.

752
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:41,075
- How much longer?

753
00:45:41,108 --> 00:45:42,611
- Man, we've been
waiting for like an hour!

754
00:45:42,644 --> 00:45:43,578
- Be patient.

755
00:45:43,612 --> 00:45:44,912
He'll be here.

756
00:45:44,945 --> 00:45:46,814
Where the fuck are you, Rick?

757
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:53,988
- There he is.

758
00:45:55,724 --> 00:45:57,057
- Let's get the show going.

759
00:45:59,326 --> 00:46:00,894
- Okay.

760
00:46:00,928 --> 00:46:01,730
First of all,

761
00:46:01,762 --> 00:46:03,197
I want to thank you all

762
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:05,799
for showing up this weekend
for the Camp of Terror.

763
00:46:07,234 --> 00:46:09,970
I don't know quite how to
say this, but here goes.

764
00:46:10,004 --> 00:46:10,804
- There he is.

765
00:46:10,838 --> 00:46:11,673
Hey!

766
00:46:17,144 --> 00:46:18,379
- Get him, Echo.

767
00:46:18,412 --> 00:46:19,280
- It's show time!

768
00:46:19,313 --> 00:46:20,649
- We wanna see.

769
00:46:20,682 --> 00:46:21,516
- Blood!
- Yeah!

770
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,121
Get him, Echo!

771
00:46:29,023 --> 00:46:31,859
- Hunter,
you son of a bitch,

772
00:46:31,892 --> 00:46:33,127
you fuckin' made it.

773
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:33,994
Ooh!

774
00:46:34,928 --> 00:46:35,996
- Let's do this.

775
00:46:37,031 --> 00:46:39,133
Let's give 'em a show.

776
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:40,501
- Get him, Echo.

777
00:46:41,569 --> 00:46:43,804
- You think I'm afraid of you?

778
00:46:43,837 --> 00:46:45,072
Ugh!

779
00:46:45,105 --> 00:46:46,641
- Bravo! Bravo!

780
00:46:46,675 --> 00:46:48,777
- Now, that's what
I'm talkin' about.

781
00:46:50,177 --> 00:46:51,178
- Holy shit!

782
00:46:53,414 --> 00:46:55,149
- He's killing the campers too.

783
00:46:55,182 --> 00:46:56,417
- That's more like it.
- Hey, that's what I mean.

784
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:57,251
- Awesome.

785
00:47:01,221 --> 00:47:02,289
- Gettin' better.

786
00:47:04,158 --> 00:47:05,893
- Great death scene, Hector.

787
00:47:05,926 --> 00:47:07,194
- You too, camper girl.

788
00:47:08,697 --> 00:47:11,865
- You wanted blood, you got it!

789
00:47:11,899 --> 00:47:14,669
Welcome to the new
Camp of Terror!

790
00:47:15,804 --> 00:47:18,172
- That's what
I'm talkin' about.

791
00:47:20,542 --> 00:47:23,277
- Great job bringing
Hunter back.

792
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:24,779
- I know.
- I want you to go

793
00:47:24,813 --> 00:47:26,046
and find Hunter,

794
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,381
and have him send
his assistant Adam

795
00:47:27,414 --> 00:47:28,817
to clean this shit up, okay?

796
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:29,684
- Okay.

797
00:47:30,585 --> 00:47:31,418
- All right.

798
00:47:32,853 --> 00:47:34,855
That Darlene, she puts on
a good show, believe me.

799
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:45,466
- Hunter?

800
00:47:47,669 --> 00:47:48,603
Hunter!

801
00:47:53,742 --> 00:47:56,009
Rick is not mad at you.

802
00:47:56,043 --> 00:47:58,345
He thinks you're
doing a great job.

803
00:48:00,782 --> 00:48:02,483
Come on, Hunter,
where are you at?

804
00:48:14,361 --> 00:48:16,263
Where the heck are you?

805
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:22,670
Enough of these games, Hunter!

806
00:48:23,538 --> 00:48:24,539
Hunter!

807
00:48:24,572 --> 00:48:25,406
Hunter!

808
00:48:26,841 --> 00:48:28,777
Stop messing with me,!

809
00:48:42,757 --> 00:48:44,793
Ha ha, this isn't funny.

810
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,195
I'm telling Rick
you're messing with me.

811
00:49:04,712 --> 00:49:06,748
Stop messing with me, Hunter.

812
00:49:06,781 --> 00:49:08,817
We're paying you good
money for this gig.

813
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,302
Rick was right.

814
00:49:33,474 --> 00:49:34,308
That's it.

815
00:49:54,863 --> 00:49:56,430
Who the fuck are you?

816
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:12,714
- Opa, oh.

817
00:50:15,717 --> 00:50:16,651
Nostrovia.

818
00:50:24,224 --> 00:50:27,562
- You shared the shit out
of those campers earlier.

819
00:50:28,997 --> 00:50:30,732
- Literally to death.

820
00:50:30,765 --> 00:50:31,599
To death!

821
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,637
- Hey, Mr. Rutherford,
where's Mrs. Rutherford?

822
00:50:41,676 --> 00:50:42,510
- Huh.

823
00:50:43,978 --> 00:50:44,979
- What's wrong?

824
00:50:45,013 --> 00:50:46,280
- Nothing.

825
00:50:46,313 --> 00:50:47,682
But she should be back now.

826
00:50:49,149 --> 00:50:49,951
- Talk to me.

827
00:50:51,953 --> 00:50:54,154
- I sent Darlene
to gather up Hunter

828
00:50:54,187 --> 00:50:56,490
for the second show
tonight, right?

829
00:50:56,524 --> 00:50:58,526
The last thing I want
is anyone to think

830
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,628
that there's
anything going wrong.

831
00:51:00,662 --> 00:51:01,930
- Yeah.

832
00:51:01,963 --> 00:51:02,897
- Mike, you could
do me a big favor

833
00:51:02,931 --> 00:51:03,865
and go look for those two.

834
00:51:03,898 --> 00:51:05,633
I'll get everybody here ready.

835
00:51:05,667 --> 00:51:10,638
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

836
00:51:12,674 --> 00:51:14,207
- One more, and then we go back.

837
00:51:15,275 --> 00:51:16,176
- Mrs. Rutherford?

838
00:51:20,247 --> 00:51:21,081
Hunter?

839
00:51:24,986 --> 00:51:25,887
Where are you guys?

840
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,056
We got a big night planned out.

841
00:51:32,392 --> 00:51:33,226
Mrs. Rutherford?

842
00:51:34,194 --> 00:51:35,228
Hunter, is that you?

843
00:51:46,507 --> 00:51:47,642
What the fuck?

844
00:51:54,749 --> 00:51:55,883
Who is that?

845
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,320
Who's there?

846
00:52:05,425 --> 00:52:06,226
Wait a minute.

847
00:52:07,929 --> 00:52:09,396
I know what's going on.

848
00:52:09,429 --> 00:52:10,965
It's my time to die.

849
00:52:12,533 --> 00:52:13,500
Oh, they want a show?

850
00:52:14,869 --> 00:52:16,236
I'll give 'em a show.

851
00:52:19,073 --> 00:52:20,541
Come on, guys, where are you?

852
00:52:22,043 --> 00:52:24,244
I don't like being alone
at night by myself!

853
00:52:30,852 --> 00:52:32,319
I knew it.

854
00:52:32,352 --> 00:52:35,023
Hunter, let's give
'em a real good show.

855
00:52:37,457 --> 00:52:39,426
Echo, is that you?

856
00:52:41,663 --> 00:52:42,563
Don't hurt me.

857
00:52:42,597 --> 00:52:44,297
Please, don't hurt me!

858
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:46,199
I'm sorry for what happened
to you and your family!

859
00:52:46,233 --> 00:52:49,269
Please don't kill me!

860
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,171
Motherfucker!

861
00:52:52,106 --> 00:52:54,307
Hunter, I'm gonna kill you!

862
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:55,643
Hey, get back here.

863
00:52:55,677 --> 00:52:58,012
I don't get paid
enough for this shit!

864
00:53:10,825 --> 00:53:12,794
Fucker, now you're mine.

865
00:53:15,395 --> 00:53:17,065
You're mine, Hunter!

866
00:53:21,636 --> 00:53:23,538
What the fuck is this place?

867
00:53:32,747 --> 00:53:34,015
Who the fuck are you?

868
00:53:36,718 --> 00:53:37,719
- Ugh, fuck.

869
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:40,521
Behind you.

870
00:53:44,324 --> 00:53:45,159
- All right, all
right, all right,

871
00:53:45,193 --> 00:53:46,393
now let's listen up.

872
00:53:46,426 --> 00:53:48,596
We are gonna give these campers

873
00:53:48,629 --> 00:53:52,133
the greatest show of shows ever

874
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:56,671
because tonight, we
all die by the hand

875
00:53:56,704 --> 00:54:01,042
of our very own
little Echo Meadows.

876
00:54:01,075 --> 00:54:02,944
Little Echo Meadows, sha.

877
00:54:02,977 --> 00:54:04,612
Woo, woo, woo, woo!

878
00:54:09,784 --> 00:54:12,019
- All right, now, I want
you all to go get ready,

879
00:54:12,053 --> 00:54:14,889
and we'll meet at
the fire pit in...

880
00:54:14,922 --> 00:54:16,724
You thought I was
gonna spill, right?

881
00:54:16,758 --> 00:54:19,560
We'll meet at the
fire pit in an hour.

882
00:54:19,594 --> 00:54:21,763
See you there or be square.

883
00:54:21,796 --> 00:54:23,831
- You're going in the wrong
direction, Mr. Rutherford.

884
00:54:23,865 --> 00:54:25,099
- I am not.

885
00:54:25,133 --> 00:54:27,902
I am going to find
my future ex-wife

886
00:54:27,935 --> 00:54:30,905
because I believe she's fucking,

887
00:54:31,873 --> 00:54:33,273
fucking Mike in the woods.

888
00:54:39,614 --> 00:54:42,282
Darlene?

889
00:54:42,315 --> 00:54:44,351
Darlene, where the?

890
00:54:44,384 --> 00:54:46,286
Where the hell are you?

891
00:54:58,465 --> 00:54:59,299
Darlene!

892
00:55:01,702 --> 00:55:02,537
Darlene!

893
00:55:05,706 --> 00:55:07,108
Stupid bitch.

894
00:55:10,011 --> 00:55:10,845
Oh!

895
00:55:15,183 --> 00:55:19,253
Oh!

896
00:55:19,287 --> 00:55:20,588
There you are, you fucker.

897
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:26,093
Where's my wife and Mike?

898
00:55:26,127 --> 00:55:27,460
Huh?

899
00:55:27,494 --> 00:55:28,796
Don't fuck around with me.

900
00:55:30,898 --> 00:55:32,600
You got a big show to do.

901
00:55:32,633 --> 00:55:33,634
Now, come on.

902
00:55:35,002 --> 00:55:36,204
Don't you fuck with me.

903
00:55:36,237 --> 00:55:37,470
You understand?

904
00:55:37,505 --> 00:55:39,406
You do your fucking job,

905
00:55:39,439 --> 00:55:40,741
and we won't have.

906
00:55:40,775 --> 00:55:41,576
Hang on.

907
00:55:41,609 --> 00:55:43,211
Hang on.

908
00:55:43,244 --> 00:55:44,377
Ooh!

909
00:55:44,411 --> 00:55:47,414
Ugh!

910
00:55:48,316 --> 00:55:50,483
Ooh, have me kill, Hunter.

911
00:56:00,328 --> 00:56:01,762
You?

912
00:57:08,029 --> 00:57:09,230
- That's some good shit.

913
00:57:09,263 --> 00:57:10,698
- And where did
you get that from?

914
00:57:10,731 --> 00:57:12,667
- These fools got it from
one of the counselors.

915
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,035
- Which one?

916
00:57:14,068 --> 00:57:14,869
- Who cares?

917
00:57:14,902 --> 00:57:16,570
- Where the women at?

918
00:57:16,604 --> 00:57:17,371
- I'm not good enough?

919
00:57:17,405 --> 00:57:18,940
- I mean.

920
00:57:18,973 --> 00:57:20,975
- Did we invite any
other ladies over?

921
00:57:21,008 --> 00:57:23,611
- Man, you ain't got a
fuckin' shot with them anyway.

922
00:57:23,644 --> 00:57:26,314
- Man, he said you
ain't got no game.

923
00:57:26,347 --> 00:57:27,982
- Man, I got more game than any

924
00:57:28,015 --> 00:57:29,984
of you motherfuckers combined.

925
00:57:30,017 --> 00:57:30,851
- That burn.

926
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,555
- Come on, man,
pass that shit over.

927
00:57:35,723 --> 00:57:36,791
- You can't handle
this shit, old man.

928
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,361
- Let me have it.

929
00:57:43,664 --> 00:57:46,334
- This camp sucks.

930
00:57:46,367 --> 00:57:51,372
- They better kill off at
least one counselor tonight.

931
00:57:52,506 --> 00:57:53,674
- Yeah, I
wouldn't hold my breath.

932
00:57:53,708 --> 00:57:54,909
- Shit, I thought this

933
00:57:54,942 --> 00:57:56,944
Camp of Terror would
be more exciting.

934
00:57:56,978 --> 00:57:58,612
- They killed
off campers earlier today.

935
00:58:04,251 --> 00:58:07,054
- Knowing Gracie, she
probably paid extra

936
00:58:07,088 --> 00:58:08,589
to have Rick kill her.

937
00:58:12,293 --> 00:58:13,160
- I know, right.

938
00:58:13,194 --> 00:58:14,261
"He's behind you.

939
00:58:14,295 --> 00:58:15,830
He's behind you."

940
00:58:18,165 --> 00:58:19,066
How much you think

941
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:20,201
that ho paid to get killed?

942
00:58:20,234 --> 00:58:21,135
- For that death?

943
00:58:21,168 --> 00:58:22,837
500 tops, that shit was whack.

944
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:24,138
- Obviously.

945
00:58:24,171 --> 00:58:25,373
- Obviously what?

946
00:58:25,406 --> 00:58:27,074
- I mean, she knew
exactly where to go.

947
00:58:27,108 --> 00:58:28,576
She was definitely in on it.

948
00:58:28,609 --> 00:58:30,244
- That doesn't
prove anything, man.

949
00:58:30,277 --> 00:58:31,512
- Sure it does.

950
00:58:31,545 --> 00:58:32,513
- How so?

951
00:58:32,546 --> 00:58:35,182
- She was clearly jealous.

952
00:58:35,216 --> 00:58:36,450
- Jealous of what?

953
00:58:36,484 --> 00:58:38,786
- I was getting
all the attention.

954
00:58:38,819 --> 00:58:40,221
- Yeah, she's got you there.

955
00:58:45,459 --> 00:58:46,994
- Epic?

956
00:58:47,028 --> 00:58:49,430
It takes more than
one kill to be epic.

957
00:58:49,463 --> 00:58:50,898
- Yeah, you got that right.

958
00:58:50,931 --> 00:58:52,466
- Well, how many do you need?

959
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,902
- At least three or four.

960
00:58:54,935 --> 00:58:56,971
- Or something really memorable.

961
00:58:57,004 --> 00:58:59,106
- Yeah, like-
- Yeah, with lots of blood.

962
00:59:00,841 --> 00:59:02,676
- I wonder what the
Rutherfords have

963
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:05,046
in store for us tonight.

964
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:06,147
- Well, whatever it is,

965
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:07,314
it better be good.

966
00:59:08,449 --> 00:59:09,850
We paid good money
for this shit.

967
00:59:09,884 --> 00:59:11,552
- Yeah, and we're just
sitting here doing nothing.

968
00:59:11,585 --> 00:59:13,054
- In this shitty-ass RV.

969
00:59:13,087 --> 00:59:15,089
- Bro, we should just leave.

970
00:59:15,122 --> 00:59:16,357
- And go where?

971
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:19,193
- Hey, anywhere's
better than here.

972
00:59:19,226 --> 00:59:20,061
- Let's go.

973
00:59:22,696 --> 00:59:23,998
What you doing?

974
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,299
- What the fuck?

975
00:59:25,332 --> 00:59:26,734
The door is locked.

976
00:59:26,767 --> 00:59:28,436
- What?

977
00:59:28,469 --> 00:59:30,971
- Hey, somebody
open a fucking window!

978
00:59:31,005 --> 00:59:32,440
- Come on!
- Hurry.

979
00:59:37,244 --> 00:59:38,446
- Is that fire?

980
00:59:38,479 --> 00:59:41,415
- Hey, somebody open!

981
00:59:41,449 --> 00:59:44,051
Hey, somebody open
a fucking window!

982
00:59:44,085 --> 00:59:47,321
- Come on, come on, hurry!
- Help!

983
00:59:47,354 --> 00:59:49,323
- What the fuck?
- Hey, somebody open

984
00:59:49,356 --> 00:59:52,426
a fuckin' window!
- Come on.

985
01:00:23,592 --> 01:00:24,391
- Where's Rick?

986
01:00:24,425 --> 01:00:25,426
He's late.

987
01:00:25,459 --> 01:00:26,627
- I don't know.

988
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:27,495
- This better not be
another disappointment.

989
01:00:27,529 --> 01:00:28,762
- Calm down.

990
01:00:28,796 --> 01:00:31,065
I'm sure it will be
here any second now.

991
01:00:31,098 --> 01:00:32,666
- The show was supposed
to start 30 minutes ago.

992
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,435
Don't you remember?

993
01:00:34,468 --> 01:00:36,137
- He's just a little late.

994
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:36,971
Don't worry.

995
01:00:37,004 --> 01:00:38,472
Tonight's gonna be epic.

996
01:00:39,508 --> 01:00:40,875
- It better be.

997
01:00:45,379 --> 01:00:46,180
- Finally.

998
01:00:46,213 --> 01:00:47,348
- It's about damn time.

999
01:00:48,617 --> 01:00:50,384
Let's see some action.

1000
01:00:50,417 --> 01:00:51,952
Let's go.

1001
01:00:51,986 --> 01:00:54,054
- I guess we're
starting without Rick.

1002
01:00:54,088 --> 01:00:55,723
- Yeah, I guess so.

1003
01:00:56,591 --> 01:00:57,559
- Ooh.
- Yes!

1004
01:00:59,393 --> 01:01:00,194
- Oh, yes.

1005
01:01:03,097 --> 01:01:05,799
- I ain't scared of you!

1006
01:01:05,833 --> 01:01:07,835
- Oh!
- Oh, yeah!

1007
01:01:07,868 --> 01:01:08,669
- Epic!

1008
01:01:09,571 --> 01:01:10,539
- Holy shit.

1009
01:01:11,872 --> 01:01:13,642
Come give me a try.

1010
01:01:20,047 --> 01:01:21,516
- Hey, what about me?

1011
01:01:28,557 --> 01:01:29,624
- More! More!

1012
01:01:30,659 --> 01:01:32,226
- Let's go, fucker.

1013
01:01:33,827 --> 01:01:35,763
- Get 'em, Echo, mm hmm.

1014
01:01:37,031 --> 01:01:38,365
- Let's do this.

1015
01:01:40,401 --> 01:01:41,202
- Ooh!

1016
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:46,874
Ooh!

1017
01:02:21,909 --> 01:02:24,679
- I'm gonna ask
you one more time

1018
01:02:27,515 --> 01:02:29,250
who the fuck are you?

1019
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:33,020
Who's that?

1020
01:02:55,677 --> 01:02:56,944
- Our last day of camp.

1021
01:02:58,178 --> 01:02:59,547
- You know what that means,

1022
01:03:00,649 --> 01:03:02,850
Echo's last day of terror.

1023
01:03:02,883 --> 01:03:05,052
- Yeah.
- Who do you think is next?

1024
01:03:05,085 --> 01:03:06,220
- Does it matter?

1025
01:03:06,253 --> 01:03:08,289
As long as it's gruesome.

1026
01:03:08,322 --> 01:03:10,457
I hope they double up the
blood on the next one.

1027
01:03:10,491 --> 01:03:12,893
- This is the best
camp experience ever.

1028
01:03:12,926 --> 01:03:14,094
- Mm hmm.

1029
01:03:14,128 --> 01:03:16,731
This is gonna make
for such a good blog.

1030
01:03:16,765 --> 01:03:19,233
- First Jacob, then Darlene,
then Mike, then Rick,

1031
01:03:19,266 --> 01:03:21,468
the new campers
arrive tomorrow, so...

1032
01:03:21,502 --> 01:03:23,672
- So then it's our turn
to die next then, right?

1033
01:03:23,705 --> 01:03:25,406
- I am so glad the
Rutherfords didn't tell us

1034
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:26,608
when we're gonna die.

1035
01:03:26,641 --> 01:03:28,142
- I'm starting to
feel a little nervous.

1036
01:03:28,175 --> 01:03:30,277
This shit's starting
to feel kind of real.

1037
01:03:33,615 --> 01:03:34,415
- Come on, let's
go meet the campers

1038
01:03:34,448 --> 01:03:35,717
over by the fire pits.

1039
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:36,984
- Right, it is our
last day, right?

1040
01:03:37,017 --> 01:03:38,185
- Let's give 'em one last show.

1041
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:54,368
- I can't breathe.

1042
01:03:54,401 --> 01:03:59,406
I can't breathe.

1043
01:04:01,609 --> 01:04:03,143
Will I get out of this?

1044
01:04:09,517 --> 01:04:11,118
Who the fuck is that?

1045
01:04:19,093 --> 01:04:19,927
No.

1046
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,529
You don't understand!

1047
01:04:21,563 --> 01:04:23,297
No, you don't understand!

1048
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:25,132
I didn't want to do that.

1049
01:04:25,165 --> 01:04:26,500
I didn't want to do that!

1050
01:04:26,534 --> 01:04:27,635
Listen.

1051
01:04:27,669 --> 01:04:29,671
I did that for...

1052
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,408
- Why are you turning here?

1053
01:04:38,713 --> 01:04:40,114
I know you hear me.

1054
01:04:42,182 --> 01:04:43,217
John!

1055
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:45,185
- Yes, I heard you!

1056
01:04:45,219 --> 01:04:46,821
- Then why didn't you answer me?

1057
01:04:48,088 --> 01:04:49,356
What the fuck, John?

1058
01:04:50,424 --> 01:04:52,493
- I just thought
silence would be better

1059
01:04:52,527 --> 01:04:54,962
than yet another fight.

1060
01:04:54,995 --> 01:04:56,664
- Well, that
clearly didn't work.

1061
01:04:59,534 --> 01:05:00,769
Where are you going?

1062
01:05:00,802 --> 01:05:02,236
We're supposed to be
going the other way.

1063
01:05:08,242 --> 01:05:10,210
- Why is this asshole
flashing me down?

1064
01:05:11,111 --> 01:05:12,312
- Just let him pass you.

1065
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:17,184
- He's not passing us.

1066
01:05:18,753 --> 01:05:20,354
- Just keep waving him by.

1067
01:05:20,387 --> 01:05:22,289
- I'm already, I'm
already doing that!

1068
01:05:23,691 --> 01:05:24,859
I'm just gonna pull over.

1069
01:05:41,643 --> 01:05:42,943
What's this asshole doing?

1070
01:05:48,348 --> 01:05:49,149
What the heck?

1071
01:05:49,183 --> 01:05:50,451
Ruby?

1072
01:05:50,484 --> 01:05:52,186
Ruby, where are you going?

1073
01:06:01,962 --> 01:06:02,797
It's you.

1074
01:06:07,201 --> 01:06:08,101
Let's go, Ruby.

1075
01:06:09,503 --> 01:06:10,772
I said let's go!

1076
01:06:10,805 --> 01:06:13,006
- Hey, easy with
the little lady.

1077
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:13,875
Okay?

1078
01:06:14,742 --> 01:06:15,543
Back off.

1079
01:06:15,577 --> 01:06:16,410
- Brother!

1080
01:06:18,145 --> 01:06:23,150
Mom and Dad always wanted
a sweet little princess.

1081
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,555
- What the fuck are
you talking about, Lou?

1082
01:06:28,623 --> 01:06:29,924
You're scaring my wife!

1083
01:06:30,825 --> 01:06:32,059
- Hey, hey, easy, mister.

1084
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:34,495
Actually, we're just
messing with you, man.

1085
01:06:34,529 --> 01:06:36,831
We just came by to
apologize to y'all

1086
01:06:36,865 --> 01:06:38,633
about what happened
earlier at the restaurant.

1087
01:06:38,666 --> 01:06:40,735
So don't shit yourself.

1088
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:44,471
Let's have fun.

1089
01:06:44,506 --> 01:06:47,140
- It's okay, we
were just leaving.

1090
01:06:47,174 --> 01:06:50,310
- Hey Ruby, I'm sorry,

1091
01:06:52,614 --> 01:06:54,248
but you ain't going anywhere.

1092
01:07:00,722 --> 01:07:02,289
- You don't have to do this!

1093
01:07:03,525 --> 01:07:07,194
- It's not what
we wanna do, John.

1094
01:07:09,329 --> 01:07:11,098
It's what we have to do!

1095
01:07:12,534 --> 01:07:14,067
We have to do this!

1096
01:07:15,235 --> 01:07:17,037
I am so sorry.

1097
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:19,874
I'm sorry.

1098
01:07:22,042 --> 01:07:24,144
Mom wanted a little girl.

1099
01:07:35,523 --> 01:07:38,660
So Dad kidnapped her that day.

1100
01:07:45,365 --> 01:07:47,535
- She had a name.

1101
01:07:48,502 --> 01:07:49,571
Echo Meadows!

1102
01:07:54,909 --> 01:07:56,744
- Jasper, is that you?

1103
01:08:10,692 --> 01:08:13,561
Wait, there's two of you.

1104
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:24,572
- Echo, sweet little princess.

1105
01:08:27,008 --> 01:08:30,078
I knew, I knew you
would come back.

1106
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:31,178
I knew it.

1107
01:08:38,019 --> 01:08:41,623
But you shoulda never
to done what you did!

1108
01:08:47,461 --> 01:08:48,730
They loved you!

1109
01:08:48,763 --> 01:08:50,430
And you killed them.

1110
01:09:01,042 --> 01:09:01,843
- Why?

1111
01:09:01,876 --> 01:09:04,478
Why are you doing this?

1112
01:09:04,512 --> 01:09:05,513
We love you.

1113
01:09:07,048 --> 01:09:07,882
- Uh!

1114
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:14,221
You're not my father!

1115
01:09:14,254 --> 01:09:15,056
- Ezra?

1116
01:09:15,923 --> 01:09:17,892
Are you in here?

1117
01:09:17,925 --> 01:09:18,760
No!

1118
01:09:19,594 --> 01:09:20,895
No, no, no, no!

1119
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:23,564
Echo!

1120
01:09:23,598 --> 01:09:26,466
You're supposed to
be our daughter!

1121
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,502
- I am not your daughter!

1122
01:09:31,171 --> 01:09:32,305
- Don't say that.

1123
01:09:34,542 --> 01:09:35,610
Come to mama.

1124
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:39,279
- You are not my mother!

1125
01:09:39,312 --> 01:09:41,149
You took me from her.

1126
01:09:43,483 --> 01:09:47,588
- Yes, I am your mama,

1127
01:09:47,622 --> 01:09:50,925
and that, that's your papa!

1128
01:09:52,694 --> 01:09:53,895
We love you.

1129
01:09:55,096 --> 01:09:56,229
- No, no!

1130
01:09:56,263 --> 01:09:58,265
You had your dim-witted,
brain-washed sons

1131
01:09:58,298 --> 01:10:00,034
murder my parents!

1132
01:10:01,736 --> 01:10:06,273
- Miserable, ungrateful
little bitch!

1133
01:10:11,879 --> 01:10:13,748
I thought you loved me!

1134
01:10:26,994 --> 01:10:27,895
- Mom? Dad?

1135
01:10:34,468 --> 01:10:35,302
Dad?

1136
01:10:41,475 --> 01:10:42,543
Jesus Christ!

1137
01:10:43,778 --> 01:10:44,612
No!

1138
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:46,614
No!

1139
01:10:48,649 --> 01:10:51,519
No, Dad, Dad, Dad,
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad!

1140
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:53,386
No!

1141
01:10:54,522 --> 01:10:56,090
No, Dad!

1142
01:10:56,124 --> 01:11:00,628
I love you. No.

1143
01:11:00,661 --> 01:11:02,964
No, no, no, no, no, no, Mom.

1144
01:11:05,099 --> 01:11:05,900
No!

1145
01:11:06,901 --> 01:11:07,702
Echo!

1146
01:11:10,437 --> 01:11:11,639
They loved you!

1147
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,008
And you killed them.

1148
01:11:17,477 --> 01:11:20,081
- They took everything from me.

1149
01:11:24,152 --> 01:11:26,486
You took everything from me!

1150
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:44,172
- We killed your brother,

1151
01:11:44,205 --> 01:11:46,541
and now we're gonna kill you.

1152
01:11:56,617 --> 01:11:58,686
- See you in hell, Lou.

1153
01:12:41,028 --> 01:12:42,029
- Come on, guys.

1154
01:12:42,063 --> 01:12:43,396
It's our last day of camp.

1155
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:44,397
Come on.

1156
01:12:44,431 --> 01:12:45,800
- Yeah.
- Come on.

1157
01:12:48,135 --> 01:12:51,072
- Yeah, you guys
still got to die.

1158
01:12:51,105 --> 01:12:52,106
- Don't worry.

1159
01:12:52,139 --> 01:12:53,307
You'll get your show.

1160
01:12:54,742 --> 01:12:58,813
- Hey, you all came
to camp to hear the story

1161
01:12:58,846 --> 01:13:01,182
of Echo Meadows and her family.

1162
01:13:01,215 --> 01:13:02,183
Am I right?

1163
01:13:02,216 --> 01:13:03,050
- Yeah!

1164
01:13:04,417 --> 01:13:08,122
- You
all paid big money

1165
01:13:08,155 --> 01:13:12,425
to see a Camp of
Terror live show?

1166
01:13:12,459 --> 01:13:13,460
- Yeah!
- Yes, we did.

1167
01:13:14,929 --> 01:13:19,901
- Sit back, relax,
and enjoy the closing act.

1168
01:13:22,103 --> 01:13:23,204
- Mike?

1169
01:13:23,237 --> 01:13:25,139
- Holy shit!

1170
01:13:25,172 --> 01:13:26,507
- I thought he was dead.

1171
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:28,943
- Oh ho, that's what
I'm talkin' about.

1172
01:13:32,914 --> 01:13:33,981
- I love this camp!

1173
01:13:35,716 --> 01:13:40,588
- Wakey,
wakey, eggs and bakey!

1174
01:13:44,424 --> 01:13:45,393
- Run!

1175
01:13:45,425 --> 01:13:46,260
Run! Run!

1176
01:13:47,427 --> 01:13:48,329
Jasper Meadows!

1177
01:13:48,362 --> 01:13:49,897
Jasper Meadows is a killer!

1178
01:13:49,931 --> 01:13:51,032
He's a killer!

1179
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,268
- Oh no, what are we gonna do?

1180
01:13:54,302 --> 01:13:56,237
- Ooh, Jasper's
gonna get you, Mike.

1181
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:57,605
He's gonna get you, ooh.

1182
01:13:58,873 --> 01:14:00,107
- This is boring.

1183
01:14:00,141 --> 01:14:01,575
Kill him already!

1184
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:10,384
- Look out, Mike.

1185
01:14:14,689 --> 01:14:15,589
- Run! Run!

1186
01:14:16,724 --> 01:14:17,490
It's him!

1187
01:14:17,525 --> 01:14:18,326
It's really him!

1188
01:14:18,359 --> 01:14:19,160
He's alive!

1189
01:14:19,193 --> 01:14:19,994
- He's alive.

1190
01:14:25,866 --> 01:14:28,669
- You're in on this too?

1191
01:14:28,703 --> 01:14:31,372
- You don't remember me, do you?

1192
01:14:33,841 --> 01:14:35,076
- What an idiot.

1193
01:14:42,049 --> 01:14:43,751
- Aren't you
supposed to be happy?

1194
01:14:49,991 --> 01:14:51,792
- Now do you remember?

1195
01:14:55,796 --> 01:14:56,597
- Oh, shit.

1196
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:57,465
Ooh!

1197
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:00,801
Ugh.

1198
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:07,775
- Don't kill me.

1199
01:15:13,881 --> 01:15:14,815
- Encore!

1200
01:15:14,849 --> 01:15:17,051
- More, more!
- Yeah!

1201
01:15:17,084 --> 01:15:18,686
- More blood, yeah!
- Yeah!

1202
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:19,887
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1203
01:15:20,855 --> 01:15:22,289
- Let's go, fucker, come on.

1204
01:15:22,323 --> 01:15:23,157
Ugh.

1205
01:15:25,559 --> 01:15:27,028
- More blood, yeah!

1206
01:15:30,031 --> 01:15:30,998
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1207
01:15:35,002 --> 01:15:36,670
- Please, no, no, no!

1208
01:15:36,704 --> 01:15:38,139
Ugh!

1209
01:15:38,172 --> 01:15:39,907
Fuck you.

1210
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:41,008
- Yeah, yeah!

1211
01:15:47,516 --> 01:15:49,518
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1212
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:51,185
- Woo hoo!
- Holy sh-

1213
01:15:53,788 --> 01:15:55,756
- More blood, yeah!
- Yeah!

1214
01:15:55,790 --> 01:15:56,957
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1215
01:16:00,628 --> 01:16:01,996
- Hey, hey, hey!

1216
01:16:04,198 --> 01:16:06,434
You know what I hate
more than counselors?

1217
01:16:06,467 --> 01:16:07,802
- What?

1218
01:16:07,835 --> 01:16:09,103
- Fuckin' reporters!

1219
01:16:13,908 --> 01:16:15,843
- I'm the last to die.

1220
01:16:15,876 --> 01:16:17,078
- Wrong!

1221
01:16:17,111 --> 01:16:17,945
Mike is.

1222
01:17:27,448 --> 01:17:28,782
- Let me go, please.

1223
01:17:28,816 --> 01:17:30,384
- Shut the fuck up!

1224
01:17:31,385 --> 01:17:33,320
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1225
01:17:34,221 --> 01:17:35,122
Help! Help!

1226
01:17:38,659 --> 01:17:39,493
Help!

1227
01:17:41,762 --> 01:17:42,963
I'm sorry, I swear.

1228
01:17:42,997 --> 01:17:44,398
I swear, I swear I
won't say anything.

1229
01:17:44,431 --> 01:17:45,232
I swear I won't say anything.

1230
01:17:45,266 --> 01:17:46,066
Let me go.

1231
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:47,134
Let me go, please.

1232
01:17:47,168 --> 01:17:48,836
- Real good at that.
- Help!

1233
01:17:48,869 --> 01:17:51,005
- Real fucking good at that.

1234
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:54,675
- Help!

1235
01:17:54,708 --> 01:17:55,544
Help!

1236
01:17:56,611 --> 01:17:57,778
Help!

1237
01:17:57,811 --> 01:17:59,313
Help!

1238
01:17:59,346 --> 01:18:00,915
Please!

1239
01:18:00,948 --> 01:18:01,949
I'm sorry, please.

1240
01:18:03,317 --> 01:18:04,752
Help!

1241
01:18:04,785 --> 01:18:05,620
Help!

1242
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:07,888
We were only kids.

1243
01:18:07,922 --> 01:18:09,123
We were only kids.

1244
01:18:09,156 --> 01:18:09,957
We were only kids.

1245
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:11,192
- You had your chance.

1246
01:18:11,225 --> 01:18:13,027
You said nothing!
- We were kids.

1247
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:13,861
We were kids.

1248
01:18:13,894 --> 01:18:14,629
We were kids.

1249
01:18:14,663 --> 01:18:15,462
Help!

1250
01:18:15,496 --> 01:18:16,330
Help!

1251
01:18:17,464 --> 01:18:18,299
- Yeah?

1252
01:18:19,433 --> 01:18:20,768
So was she.

1253
01:18:34,381 --> 01:18:35,182
Shut up!

1254
01:18:35,216 --> 01:18:36,717
Shut the fuck up!

1255
01:18:48,563 --> 01:18:49,396
Ugh.

1256
01:19:16,156 --> 01:19:17,224
- We're finally here.

1257
01:19:18,959 --> 01:19:21,128
- We're finally off
that shitty bus.

1258
01:19:22,296 --> 01:19:23,330
- You'd think the
Rutherfords would have

1259
01:19:23,364 --> 01:19:24,832
a more comfortable bus.

1260
01:19:24,865 --> 01:19:27,501
But I guess the rich
get richer for a reason.

1261
01:19:27,535 --> 01:19:29,870
- Ah, come on, this
is gonna be awesome.

1262
01:19:29,903 --> 01:19:31,573
- I wonder who's
gonna die first.

1263
01:19:31,606 --> 01:19:32,773
- Her.

1264
01:19:32,806 --> 01:19:35,142
- Yeah, the bimbo
always gets it first.

1265
01:19:35,175 --> 01:19:36,511
- It's always the stoner.

1266
01:19:36,544 --> 01:19:38,445
- You guys are way off.

1267
01:19:51,859 --> 01:19:53,460
- Man, you scared everybody off.

1268
01:19:53,494 --> 01:19:54,995
- Not everyone.

1269
01:19:55,029 --> 01:19:56,263
- Do you see that?

1270
01:19:56,297 --> 01:19:57,097
Over there.

1271
01:19:57,131 --> 01:19:58,032
- Yes, I do.

1272
01:19:58,065 --> 01:19:59,900
- No, no, over there, the ones.

1273
01:19:59,933 --> 01:20:01,935
- There it is indeed.

1274
01:20:01,969 --> 01:20:03,437
- Loser.

1275
01:20:14,048 --> 01:20:17,284
Who the fuck are you?

1276
01:20:17,318 --> 01:20:18,886
Great, another loser.

1277
01:20:18,919 --> 01:20:19,721
Ow!

1278
01:20:23,123 --> 01:20:25,794
You used to hide in the group.

1279
01:20:25,826 --> 01:20:29,496
And now I have you all alone.

1280
01:20:29,531 --> 01:20:33,267
All alone!

1281
01:20:41,308 --> 01:20:42,109
- Help!

1282
01:20:42,142 --> 01:20:43,310
- Help!

1283
01:20:43,344 --> 01:20:44,912
Help!

1284
01:20:44,945 --> 01:20:45,780
Help!

1285
01:20:46,781 --> 01:20:47,981
Help!

1286
01:20:48,015 --> 01:20:49,249
Oh, no!

1287
01:20:49,283 --> 01:20:50,117
Oh, no!

1288
01:20:51,118 --> 01:20:51,952
Oh, no!

1289
01:20:59,561 --> 01:21:00,361
Ha ha!

1290
01:21:15,109 --> 01:21:15,943
- Hello?

1291
01:21:18,513 --> 01:21:19,346
Holy shit.

1292
01:21:23,818 --> 01:21:26,053
I don't remember this cabin.

1293
01:21:26,086 --> 01:21:26,920
Holy crap.

1294
01:21:28,389 --> 01:21:29,390
That's cool.

1295
01:21:34,895 --> 01:21:35,730
Oh, cool.

1296
01:21:42,369 --> 01:21:43,203
Cool.

1297
01:21:58,553 --> 01:21:59,953
Nice touch.

1298
01:22:06,528 --> 01:22:08,362
Jeez!

1299
01:22:14,101 --> 01:22:14,935
Oh, you're.

1300
01:22:16,838 --> 01:22:18,573
What's wrong?

1301
01:22:21,709 --> 01:22:23,578
What's wrong with you?

1302
01:22:26,246 --> 01:22:27,882
What the fuck is
wrong with you, huh?

1303
01:22:29,818 --> 01:22:31,385
Mm.

1304
01:22:31,418 --> 01:22:32,252
Mm.

1305
01:22:35,623 --> 01:22:38,025
You should smile more.

1306
01:22:38,058 --> 01:22:38,893
Bitch.

1307
01:22:40,461 --> 01:22:41,629
- You are all the same.

1308
01:22:44,465 --> 01:22:46,300
You don't remember me, do you?

1309
01:22:52,574 --> 01:22:53,407
- No.

1310
01:23:00,481 --> 01:23:01,315
Hey.

1311
01:23:09,022 --> 01:23:10,057
Shit.

1312
01:23:10,090 --> 01:23:11,492
Okay, okay, okay.

1313
01:23:16,396 --> 01:23:17,197
Ugh!

1314
01:23:40,622 --> 01:23:42,389
- It's gonna be okay.

1315
01:23:46,226 --> 01:23:48,963
The new campers are here.

1316
01:23:48,997 --> 01:23:50,832
- You know what we have
to do, little brother.

1317
01:24:39,379 --> 01:24:40,548
- They
say you cross paths

1318
01:24:40,582 --> 01:24:43,918
with at least 20 killers
over your lifetime.

1319
01:24:43,952 --> 01:24:45,887
You don't even know it,

1320
01:24:46,988 --> 01:24:49,057
except for this time.

1321
01:24:49,089 --> 01:24:50,959
'Cause I know you see me.

1322
01:27:17,337 --> 01:27:18,539
- Breaking news.

1323
01:27:18,573 --> 01:27:20,240
A pit of bodies has been found

1324
01:27:20,273 --> 01:27:21,976
on the premises
of Camp Echo Lake.

1325
01:27:23,243 --> 01:27:25,847
- In a scene eerily
similar to the events.

1326
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:30,383
- 20 years ago to the day
that hit Camp Pleasant Lake.

1327
01:27:31,351 --> 01:27:32,720
- Authorities were called in

1328
01:27:32,754 --> 01:27:34,989
after concerned family
members contacted the police.

1329
01:27:36,456 --> 01:27:39,292
- The only trace left behind
was a cryptic message.

1330
01:27:40,128 --> 01:27:41,095
- Written in blood.

1331
01:27:41,996 --> 01:27:42,930
- Smile more.

1332
01:27:44,565 --> 01:27:46,801
- This has got to be
a publicity stunt.

1333
01:27:48,368 --> 01:27:50,337
- A horror camp where all
of the campers disappear?

1334
01:27:51,539 --> 01:27:52,707
- That were murdered.

1335
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:53,875
- Where's the proof?

1336
01:27:53,908 --> 01:27:54,976
- And where did they all go?

1337
01:27:56,210 --> 01:27:56,844
- This seems like
something straight out

1338
01:27:56,878 --> 01:27:57,578
of a video game.

1339
01:27:58,980 --> 01:27:59,881
- What kind of video game?

1340
01:27:59,914 --> 01:28:01,783
- I don't know, Horror Fan 69,

1341
01:28:01,816 --> 01:28:04,152
kind of like a real live
"Friday the 13th" game.

1342
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:07,454
- Yeah, I mean, everyone,
literally everyone,

1343
01:28:07,487 --> 01:28:08,656
is on Twitter right now.

1344
01:28:10,057 --> 01:28:10,892
- Please.

1345
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:14,427
- I love this shit.
