1
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:21,955
Danger!
One minute 'til meteor impact!

2
00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:25,593
Danger! Seek shelter!

3
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,561
One minute 'til meteor impact!

4
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,530
Won't some superhero save us?

5
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,733
We need more than one.
We need...

6
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:33,834
Them!

7
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,506
Thundermans, reporting for duty.

8
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:41,809
Glad they finally saw us.

9
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:44,445
Right? We've been holding
this pose for three minutes.

10
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,248
Okay, T-Force, we got meteors,
coming in hot!

11
00:00:47,348 --> 00:00:48,382
Say your name and fan out.

12
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:49,717
Why do we need to say our names?

13
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:51,785
'Cause it looks great
in the highlight reel.

14
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:55,856
Thunder Man!

15
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:57,225
Electress!

16
00:00:57,325 --> 00:00:58,726
Laser Girl!

17

Kid Quick!

18
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:02,463
Thunder Baby!

19
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:04,698
Can I get a new name?

20
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,167
Thunder Girl!

21
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:08,469
And-- Wait, what's my cool name?

22
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,104
Max, flaming space chunks.

23
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:12,173
And Max Flaming Space Chunks!

24
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,508
All right, guys,
as your co-captains,

25
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:15,909
Phoebe and I will take
the first wave.

26
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,010
Stand by for orders.

27
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:18,011
Here they come!

28
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:22,783
You did not just snap a selfie!

29
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,853
Phoebe, I know exactly how much
time I have until--

30
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:27,388
Meteor.

31
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:29,290
Whoa!

32
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:35,028
This one's all me!

33
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,268
You got incoming, Nora!

34
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:42,002
I know, I have eyes.

35
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,637
Laser eyes.

36
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:48,809
Stand behind me, Chloe.

37
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:51,279
Eat lightning, space rock!

38
00:01:57,185 --> 00:01:59,753
"Eat lightning," Barb?
I like it!

39
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,923
I know, right?
It just came to me!

40
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:04,292
Here comes the mama bear.

41
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:07,127
- Dad!
- Dad!

42
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:08,662
Billy, set a perimeter.

43
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,264
On it!

44
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:11,599
What's a perimeter?

45
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:14,101
The thing with the cones
that keeps people back.

46
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:16,069
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got you.

47
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:20,874
- Steady, Dad.
- You got this.

48
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:25,779
Welcome to Earth.
Try the punch!

49
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:37,558
Come on, guys. Let's go home.

50
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:43,564
- Max, you should probably--
- You're in my light, Billy.

51
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,399
Max, you might wanna--

52
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,468
I'm kind of busy, Nora!

53
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:49,237
Are we just gonna leave
without telling him?

54
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:50,738
Absolutely.

55
00:02:57,545 --> 00:02:59,179
You guys could have warned me.

56
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:24,004
Ah, great day, guys!

57
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:26,740
We made the world safer.
Isn't that what it's all about?

58
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,877
All right, Maxinators.
That's today's livestream.

59
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:32,346
Sorry there was so much Phoebe!

60
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:33,981
Stay awesome.

61
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:36,717
And don't forget to smash
that heart button.

62
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,652
I'll smash that heart button.

63
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:41,389
T-Force assistant?

64

<i>Generating new phone.</i>

65
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:49,263
My turn to push it!

66
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:52,733
Billy, it's the same photo.

67
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,201
We don't live a double life
anymore.

68
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:55,703
I know that.

69
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:58,506
Why didn't you tell me?

70
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:01,241
All right, guys,

71
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:03,377
who's excited for Family Night?

72
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:05,279
- Yay, Family Night!
- Mom, sounds great.

73
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:08,482
Can't wait. Right after a quick
mission review sesh.

74
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,284
- Oh.
- Aww.

75
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:13,220
Mission review... now?

76
00:04:13,321 --> 00:04:15,823
Can't it wait, Phoebe?
We haven't had a Family Night

77
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:18,225
since you two brought us on
to the T-Force.

78
00:04:18,326 --> 00:04:20,294
Guys, it'll be quick,
I promise.

79
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:22,095
There's just 27 things.

80
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,698
Okay, uh, Nora,

81
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:27,401
try ricocheting your eye lasers
to give them more power.

82
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:28,869
Oh, like this?

83
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,173
Now it's Family Night!

84
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,676
I'll start the Thunder chili!

85
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:36,744
I'll get the scrapbook.

86
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:38,211
And I'll get the board games.

87
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:40,614
Okay, great review sesh.

88
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:46,019
One, two, three.

89
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,788
- Your turn, Phoebe.
- Check it out.

90
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:50,391
This blog says I'm a cinch
for "Superhero of the Year."

91
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:52,626
Skipping Phoebe. Max's turn.

92
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:55,095
Check this out.
<i>Supe Magazine</i> just voted me

95
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:01,769
Hey, Nora.

96
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:03,471
Do you want to videochat
with our new friends tonight?

97
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:06,874
We don't have any friends here.
All we do is fight villains.

98
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,809
What about those kids
we hung out with last week?

99
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:11,178
That was Squid Man
and his evil hench-squids.

100
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:14,715
No wonder they kept
spitting ink at me.

101
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:19,587
Oh, isn't this nice, Hank?

102
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:23,190
We finally get a night
of being a regular family.

103
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:25,393
Everything okay down there?

104
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:27,194
No, it's been three years

105
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,797
and I still can't get
a good butt groove going.

<i>Alert! Alert!</i>
<i>Crime in progress.</i>

107
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,568
"Crime" is a little strong.

108
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,937
He's just rubbing his butt
into the couch.

109
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:39,407
No, Mom,
he means an actual crime.

110
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:40,741
Excuse us, Chloe.

111
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,810
Accessing crime lab.

112
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:47,981
That was the T.V. remote.

113
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,227
Okay.

The Metroburg Bank.

117

Looks like Blue Flame's making
some after-hours withdrawals.

118
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:17,210
- We better take this.
- Concur.

119

Guys, you agreed
to a Family Night weeks ago.

Let another supe take this.

121

Especially not some
rock star wannabes

with clothes
that light up.

148

Why don't our clothes light up?

Guys, you promised us
a Family Night.

Don't worry, Barb.

They can stop Family Night,

but they can't stop
the chili!

154

Okay, T-Force. Night protocol.

- Block all available exits.
- Let's bring the thunder.

156
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,604
Remember, the sooner we're done,

157
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:53,273
the sooner we're eating
Family Night chili!

158
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,346
Hey, Blue Flame,
we can do this the easy way,

00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,729
I sure do!

165
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,831
Sky selfie!

166
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,668
I got photobombed
by the V-Team.

167
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:21,935
The V-Team?

168
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,837
V-Team! Ready...

169
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:25,573
- ...For...
- ...Action!

170
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:29,142
Whoa, it's really them!

171
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,243
Hey, guys!

172
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:35,248
V-Team, stand down.
This is our mission.

173
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,219
You look tired.
We'll take it from here.

174
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,922
And steal our glory?
I don't think so.

175
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,124
Yeah, we're not sharing credit

176
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:46,426
with a bunch of light-up
super-zeroes.

177
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,961
Nora, fire when ready.

178
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,164
That suit looks like
it's laser-resistant.

179
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,234
Just do it!
We are not losing this.

180
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,837
If the blast gets repelled,
no telling where it will go.

181
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:59,306
Guys, V-Team's closing in.
Quit stalling!

182
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:01,408
Nora, take the shot!
That's an order!

183
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:05,946
Whoa-oh-oh!

184
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:12,853
Whoa-oh!

185
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,862
Ow?

186
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:29,402
Plasma blast!

187
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,943
Villain down.
No need to thank us.

188
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:40,981
Whoa-oh!

189
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,017
Come on, let's go.

190
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:55,996
Okay, so things got
a little messy.

191
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,198
We crushed someone
with a giant donut!

192
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,267
My follower count.

193
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,770
My Maximillions are down
to Maxithousands!

194
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,072
Plus Family Night was ruined.

195
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:07,474
- Mom, this is serious.
- Quit joking around!

196
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:11,444
<i>Alert! Alert!</i>
<i>President Kickbutt approaching!</i>

197
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,182
Oh, relax. I'm sure she hasn't
heard what happened.

198
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,151
I heard what happened!

199
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,188
In light of this evening's
events,

200
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,824
I'm afraid the T-Force
is hereby...

201
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:24,992
decommissioned.

202
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:26,526
Thanks, Your Highness.

203
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:28,061
Billy, that means we're fired.

204
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,430
Not cool, Your Highness.

205
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,833
Are you serious?

206
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:34,668
But the T-Force is
the most successful team

207
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:35,936
in Hero League history.

208
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,471
The rules say
anyone who injures a supe

209
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,707
in the line of duty

210
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:40,941
must be fired.

211
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,843
But the V-Team
crashed our mission.

212
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:44,845
They caught the perp!

213
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:47,180
You knocked over
a two-ton donut.

214
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:49,917
Unbelievable.

215
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:52,119
Good luck finding a team
that can replace us.

216
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:55,923
V-Team, reporting...

217
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:57,257
- ...For...
- ...Duty.

218
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,727
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

219
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:01,128
They're new,

220
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:03,230
but their success
has been remarkable.

221
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,266
And they can really rock.

222
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,068
Yeah, they can!

223
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:11,038
Ow! You know it's true.

224
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:12,973
Thundermans,

225
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:15,542
we have some mighty big
super-shoes to fill.

226
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:18,712
Come on, team.
Let's help them pack their junk.

227
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:21,214
- Oh, hold me back.
- No, hold me back!

228
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:22,682
I'm sorry.

229
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:26,319
Turn in your supersuits
and be out by noon tomorrow.

230
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,456
But where are we supposed to go?

231
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:35,162
We're back in Hiddenville, baby.

232
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,801
<i>Alert! Alert!</i>
<i>Welcome home, Thundermans.</i>

233
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:43,070
<i>Would it have killed you</i>
<i>to say goodbye?</i>

234
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:46,907
I can't believe we're back.

235
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:49,109
I know,
it looks exactly the same.

236
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,811
Right? It's like we never left.

237
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,313
- It's more like we left...
- Kicked butt for three years.

238
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:54,915
...had a mission ruined
by superjerks.

239
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:57,617
- Got fired.
- Came back to wallow in shame.

240
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:00,453
Okay, you two,
maybe it isn't ideal,

241
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,155
but at least
we're still a family.

242
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,291
Just try and make
the best of it.

243
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:06,659
Stop mocking me.

244
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:10,864
Come on. Let's go shopping
for high school clothes.

245
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,265
We're going to high school?

246
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,701
Yeah, we finally get to be
around other teenagers.

247
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:16,469
And get a well-rounded
education?

248
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,504
Who cares?

249
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:22,475
Oh... I missed you,
old friend.

250
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,879
Hank, do you and your butt
groove want to be alone?

251
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,747
For a few minutes, Barb. Thanks.

252
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:31,451
I'm kidding, of course.

253
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:34,254
I'll see you later.

254
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,026
- What do we do now, Max?
- Never use the couch again?

255
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:42,462
No, I mean <i>this.</i>
It's all so weird.

256
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:44,764
If we're not superheroes
anymore, who are we?

257
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:46,399
We <i>are</i> superheroes, Phoebe.

258
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,468
Remember,
we still have our powers.

259
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:53,706
That's really old.

260
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,643
I still don't get it.

261
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:59,612
We never summoned the V-Team.
Why'd they even show up?

262
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,351
Phoebes, don't worry
about the V-Team.

263
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,785
They're already regretting
taking our jobs.

264
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:08,155
Because they know they can't
live up to our legacy?

265
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:10,824
No, because I put glue
on all the toilet seats.

266
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:16,329
One good thing
about getting fired?

267
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,598
I have my own private
lair again.

268
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,469
So the dog says,

269
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:25,572
"Flea shampoo? I didn't even
know they had hair."

270
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,518
Human! Run for it!

271
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:44,057
Hey, come back.
The party's just started.

272
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,158
There's no humans here.

273
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,359
Hey, Colosso.

274
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,161
Aah! Max!

275
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:50,597
What are you doing back?

276
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,632
We got replaced.

277
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:54,001
What?

278
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:56,269
Who could possibly replace
Max Thunderman

279
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:57,905
and his annoying family?

280
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:00,007
These three supes called
the V-Team.

281
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,409
Hey, Max, I was thinking--

282
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:03,176
Colosso?

283
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:06,046
Hey! It's Phoebe!

284
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:08,381
Listen, I heard what happened,

285
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,183
and I want you to know, well,

286
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:11,384
I'm here for you.

287
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:12,652
Eww.

288
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:15,355
Yup, felt gross to me too.

289
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:19,126
Anyway, I was thinking
about what Mom said,

290
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:20,460
about making the best of it,

291
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,329
and, I mean, superheroes
help people, right?

292
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:24,697
So I'm gonna figure out
how I can help people

293
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:25,698
here in Hiddenville.

294
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,767
Loser talk!

295
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:28,969
Excuse me?

296
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:31,071
You guys have superpowers.

297
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:34,674
You should use them
to incite fear and terror!

298
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:36,243
Hmm. You mean, like this?

299
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:40,713
See, she gets it.

300
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:44,017
You're right, Colosso,

301
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:45,685
I am gonna use my superpowers.

302
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:47,955
To incite fear and terror?

303
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:49,356
To get a job.

304
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:51,691
Need to make some money
to rebuild the Max brand.

305
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:55,328
What do you guys have
against fear and terror?

306
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:00,900
Making waffles on a school day.

307
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,369
Really takes me back.

308
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:04,304
We may not be superheroes
anymore,

309
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,273
but we're still super parents.

310
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:07,540
Morning! No time to sit.

311
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,342
These look great. Thanks!
Got to go! Bye!

312
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:12,079
Whoa, slow down.
What is the big rush?

313
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:13,380
We have friends to make.

314
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,115
Do you have everything you need
for school?

315
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:17,217
Cool teen clothes to fit in
with our peers.

316
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,752
Some surefire
conversation starters.

317
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,022
"That new band is fire."

318
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:23,490
"Parents, am I right?"

319
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:27,360
And a hundred sticks
of beef jerky.

320
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,596
Nothing says friendship
like cured meat.

321
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,066
Any pens, notebooks?
Maybe a ruler?

322
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,168
- Dad, it's not about that.
- Nora!

323
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,170
You want a bow for school?

324
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,571
No, thanks!

325
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:44,244
It's like they don't need us
anymore.

326
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:47,747
Thank goodness our baby
still needs us.

327
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:49,216
Yeah.

328
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,353
There's our little fifth-grader.

329
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,256
Oh, she's got her backpack
and her--

330
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:58,491
- skateboard?
- Skateboard?

331
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:00,527
Max gave it to me.

332
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,429
Now that we're not
superheroes anymore,

333
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,998
I can do all sorts of fun stuff
without you guys protecting me.

334
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:08,768
Did you hear that, Hank?

335
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:11,671
Chloe doesn't want us
to protect her.

336
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,773
She doesn't need us
anymore either.

337
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,977
I'm frightened, Hank.

338
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,113
It's okay, Barb,

339
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,315
maybe it's time for Mommy
and Daddy bird

340
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:25,552
to step aside
and let our baby birds

341
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:26,886
fly.

342
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:30,790
She's using the toaster
unsupervised.

343
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,325
Oh, not on our watch!

344
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:41,401
Parents, am I right?

345
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:44,704
Oh, hey, look. It's that
Principal Bradford guy.

346
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:49,642
Well!

347
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,312
You must be our two new
students, huh?

348
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:55,348
Let's see here.
We got Billy and Nora

349
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:58,118
Thunderma--

350
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:00,320
No!

351
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:02,355
Are you kidding me?

352
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:04,724
Are you two the siblings of...

353
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:05,558
those other ones?

354
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,494
Oh, you mean Max and Phoeb--

355
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:09,696
Don't say their names.

356
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:13,032
Those two delinquents
ruined my life.

357
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:14,834
You seem fine now.

358
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:18,438
When they left town,

359
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,207
it was like a cloud was lifted.

360
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:22,142
I stopped sleeping
at the school,

361
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:23,610
got back together with Janet,

362
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,778
and I grew this awesome
ponytail.

363
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,281
Hey, boss.
P-tail's looking tight!

364
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,551
Thanks, dawg,
just had it blown out.

365
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,853
So what'll it take
to keep you two away, huh?

366
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:36,356
Money, candy, fake I.D.s?

367
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,958
We could just
stay out of your way.

368
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,493
Oh.

369
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,229
Playing the long game, huh?

370
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:45,532
Arrgh! That's just what
they would do!

371
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,001
Move. Now. Move!

372
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:50,937
Time to make friends.

373
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:52,539
Remember, don't use our powers.

374
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,108
We want people to like us
for us.

375
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,409
Right.

376
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:57,877
We heard your last name's
Thunderman.

377
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:00,380
- Do you have superpowers?
- I sure do. Check it out!

378
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,081
No way!

379
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:03,716
Did you see that?

380
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,787
Nora, I thought you said
don't use our powers.

381
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:10,657
I know, I panicked.
I really want friends.

382
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:13,860
Hey, check it out.

383
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:19,466
- Cherry!
- Phoebe!

384
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:24,471
Reunion selfie.

385
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:27,674
I missed you so much.

386
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:28,675
Me too.

387
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:29,676
I've been auditioning
new Phoebes,

388
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:30,910
but no one's
working out.

389
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,345
Good one.

390
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,781
Harriet, I told you no.

391
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:41,554
I'm so sorry
you lost your job.

392
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,723
Oh, it's okay. I'm fine.

393
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,158
Fresh start.

394
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:46,326
I wanna get a job.

395
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:47,727
One where I can still
help people.

396
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:50,663
I have a job where I help
people all day.

397
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:55,067
- You work at Splatburger?
- Uh-huh.

398
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,103
Can we get our check?

399
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:58,205
It's on the house.

400
00:18:58,305 --> 00:18:59,739
Oh.

401
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:02,209
I don't even know
what that means!

402
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,044
It means you got
a lot of happy customers.

403
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,214
O.M.G., I have the best idea.

404
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:08,715
You should work here with me!

405
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:11,484
Ooh, you want me to work
for Mrs. Wong?

406
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:14,053
It's okay, she's completely
different now.

407
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:16,423
Phoebe Thunderman?

408
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:18,157
Hi, Mrs. Wong.

409
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:20,860
Oh! This brings back so many

410
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,495
bad memories.

411
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,064
I thought you said
she was different now.

412
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,599
I meant she lost the accent.

413
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,701
She's still really mean.

414
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,870
Mrs. Wong,

415
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,040
what do you think of the idea
of Phoebe working here?

416
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:35,975
I'd love that!

417
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:37,310
- You would?
- Yes.

418
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,413
I'd have a famous celebrity
working in my restaurant.

419
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,550
And you'd be humiliated.

420
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:46,753
Yay!

421
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,688
Come back to the kitchen
and I'll show you what to do

422
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,790
when the raccoons
get into the tater tots.

423
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:56,896
It's so sweetcheous you're back,
Max.

424
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:59,899
Thanks, guys.
Stoked to rejoin the band.

425
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:02,435
And sorry you had to fire
your old lead singer.

426
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:03,736
Ah, don't sweat it.

427
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,438
Grandpa Giddy understands.

428
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,241
Curse you, Max Thunderman!

429
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,282
Ah, I miss this terrible food.

430
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:16,583
Careful, Max,

431
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:18,251
Wong installed microphones
at every table

432
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:19,719
to shut down complainers.

433
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,454
<i>Oh, you don't like the fries?</i>

434
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,690
<i>Then say bye to your fries!</i>

435
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,261
So, Wolfgang,
what are you up to?

436
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:29,462
Wolfgang.

437
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,830
That's what I thought.

438
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,065
Is that your mom?

439
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,901
Tell her I'm still single.

440
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:36,769
Still not cool, Gideon.

441
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,406
Probably a customer
for my new business,

442
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:41,207
"Superpowers By The Hour."

443
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:42,875
I put up flyers all over town.

444
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,711
Yeah, this is Max.

445
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:46,713
I'm available. How's 2:00 p.m.?

446
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:50,082
Take that!

447
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,293
Oh!

448
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,161
Ugh!

449
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,030
I'm such a butter-claws.

450
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:07,567
I've got visitors
for Dark Mayhem,

451
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:10,069
King Crab, and the other guy.

452
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:12,138
Strongdor have name too!

453
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:14,273
Hey, Leon, think fast!

454
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:21,113
Thank you, guard,
we'll take it from here.

455
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,751
Listen up, villains,

456
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:27,420
we're in charge now,
so show a little respect.

457
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,756
What happened
to the Thundermans?

458
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:32,158
Those second-rate cape jockeys?

459
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:34,961
We kicked 'em to the curb
and sent them on their way...

460
00:21:35,562 --> 00:21:37,029
Dad.

461
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,799
I told you our kids
wouldn't let us down.

462
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:43,736
Now please, take off
those hideous disguises.

463
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:52,979
Hey! Him Strongdor son!

464
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,282
Oh, I just can't get over it.

465
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:58,918
You all look so tall and evil.

466
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:01,554
Stand up straight, pumpkin.

467
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,122
O.M.G., Dad. Cringe.

468
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:06,225
I'm not a kid,
I'm a full-on princess.

469
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,561
Looks like Dark Mayhem, Jr.,

470
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,763
forgot his cape and mask.

471
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:12,732
I don't do capes, Dad.

472
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,067
And this ocular blaster's lit.

473
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,003
But I wear a mask.

474
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:19,238
Yeah, and no one knows what
you're saying half the time.

475
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,974
You're like,.

476
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:22,975
What?

477
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,378
Guys, guys,
this is a prison cell.

478
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:26,779
Let's keep it civil.

479
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:29,315
Now where are the Thundermans?

480
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:30,483
Back in Hiddenville.

481
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:33,386
They were positively
gobsmacked.

482
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,689
Wife send boy
to fancy boarding school.

483
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,658
Now him talk weird.

484
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:40,627
Excellent.

485
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:42,629
With the Thundermans
out of the picture,

486
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:44,731
you can release us
and we can finally

487
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:47,033
resume our evil plans.

488
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:50,336
- Yeah, about that--
- Show 'em what we've got, boys!

489
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,342
One, tap into everyone's
landlines

490
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:59,479
and transmit the hypnotic
message for them to obey us.

491
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:00,913
What's a landline?

492
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:05,718
Two, invite every superhero
to an outdoor Macarena contest--

493
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:07,820
Yeah, we get it. You're old.

494
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,757
Look, here's the thing,

495
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:13,325
we've decided
to do our own plan.

496
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:17,764
We're totes gonna create a
worldwide army of supervillains.

497
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:20,166
With a secret item
the Hero League

498
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:22,735
has been guarding
for over 100 years.

499
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:24,871
Oh, do you hear that, Strongdor?

500
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:26,639
There's a secret item.

501
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,240
It's cool, guys.

502
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:32,144
We'll just do our plans
when their dumb one fails.

503
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,613
Whoa!

504
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:35,948
Listen up, boomer.

505
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:38,284
You had your chance
and you blew it.

506
00:23:38,384 --> 00:23:40,687
Now it's time for me
to make a name for myself!

507
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:44,390
Your name's literally
Dark Mayhem, Jr.!

508
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,828
Come on, we're out of here.

509
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,362
- Nepo baby.
- What?

510
00:23:50,463 --> 00:23:51,831
N-Nothing.

511
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,600
Wait, aren't you going
to let us out?

512
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,636
O.M.G, Dad,
it's not always about you.

513
00:23:56,736 --> 00:23:58,605
- Let's bounce.
- Cheerio!

514
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,714
Thanks for the ride home,
Cherry.

515
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:09,982
Any time. Being seen
on the Splat Scooter

516
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:12,151
really ups my cool factor.

517
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,358
So, how was work?

518
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,260
Fantastic. How about yours?

519
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,662
Awesome.

520
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:25,998
We have to get
our jobs back! I know!

521
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:28,000
Mrs. Wong made me use
my freeze breath

522
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,802
to make burger grease slushies.

523
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:31,671
Mr. Fustarellio made me use
my heat breath

524
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:33,039
to make homemade candles.

525
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,374
- That doesn't sound so bad.
- From his ear wax.

526
00:24:36,543 --> 00:24:38,978
We have to convince President
Kickbutt to hire us back.

527
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:41,514
How?
She fired the entire T-Force.

528
00:24:41,614 --> 00:24:43,115
True.

529
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:45,852
But she didn't fire...

530
00:24:45,952 --> 00:24:47,954
the Tree Force!

531
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:52,091
You want us to fight crime
dressed as apple trees?

532
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:55,094
Yes! We'll have cool,
apple-based weapons

533
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:57,396
and nicknames.
Dad, you're "Red Delicious."

534
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,566
- Mom, you're "Pink Lady."
- Can I be "Granny Smith"?

535
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,868
You just made the Tree Force!

536
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,404
You guys seem
a little desperate.

537
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,273
- Uh-huh.
- You think?

538
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:09,942
We just can't give up
this easily.

539
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:12,244
Can't you talk with President
Kickbutt and reason with her?

540
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,513
Yeah, how do you guys stand
not being superheroes?

541
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:18,250
Actually, you guys may not want
to hear this, but...

542
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,353
we don't wanna be
the T-Force anymore.

543
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:24,223
Because you want to be
the Tree Force, right?

544
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:27,026
Right?

545
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:30,930
No, because you guys were
kind of tough to work for.

546
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,232
Between Phoebe's obsession
with being the best

547
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:35,602
and Max's with being
the best-looking,

548
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:38,037
you forgot that we are a family.

549
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:40,372
What are you talking about?
We spent 24/7 together.

550
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:43,910
We spent 24/7 with Thunder Girl
and Swoosh Boy,

551
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,645
but you had us work all the time

552
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:47,647
so you could get
more superhero glory.

553
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:50,983
This is crazy. You guys miss
being superheroes, don't you?

554
00:25:52,018 --> 00:25:53,419
It feels nice to finally
make friends.

555
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,855
I got invited to the skate park
tomorrow.

556
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:57,023
- What?
- What?

557
00:25:57,123 --> 00:25:59,325
First the avocado toast,
now this.

558
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:01,928
All right, well, maybe you're
all done being superheroes,

559
00:26:02,028 --> 00:26:03,129
but we're not.

560
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:05,297
Some of us have
some self-respect.

561
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,398
Come on, Max.

562
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:20,179
How can they say
we don't care about family?

563
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,248
We're the ones who hired them
to be on the T-Force.

564
00:26:22,348 --> 00:26:25,051
I know. And your need to be the
best helped make us successful.

565
00:26:25,151 --> 00:26:26,819
- Thank you!
- Even if it was annoying.

566
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,255
Thank you. Wait, what?

567
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:31,691
Well, like they said...

568
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:33,993
you could be a little demanding.

569
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,928
How am I demanding?

570
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:38,631
I demand you tell me
how I was demanding!

571
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:40,232
Hey, they said it.

572
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:42,268
I'm just agreeing
a thousand percent.

573
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:44,436
A least I cared
about my job.

574
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,205
All you cared about
were your followers

575
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:48,040
and how your swoosh looked
on the cover of <i>Supe Magazine.</i>

576
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,142
She can hear you!

577
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,912
Don't listen to the mean lady.

578
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,580
You know what?

579
00:26:54,681 --> 00:26:55,782
Maybe the T-Force <i>is</i> over.

580
00:26:55,882 --> 00:26:57,684
I'm gonna get my job back
by myself.

581
00:26:57,784 --> 00:26:59,886
From now on,
call me the "Pheeb Force."

582
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:03,455
Fine. Then I'm getting
my job back by myself.

583
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,124
Dweeb Force.

584
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:09,495
How did I not see that coming?

585
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:12,498
<i>- * Superheroes, rockin' band *</i>

586
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:14,867
<i>* They're the coolest superhero</i>
<i>team in all the la-- *</i>

587
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:18,070
What are you doing?

588
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:21,140
Uh, not rocking out
to the V-Team's terrible song?

589
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,442
Those light-up-pajama-wearing
posers?

590
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:24,610
Whatever.

591
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:26,278
You know, Max,

592
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:29,115
these V-Teamers look familiar,
like I've met them before.

593
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:31,217
And how would <i>you</i>
have met <i>them?</i>

594
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:33,219
They're superheroes,
you're a supervillain.

595
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:37,189
Unless...
they're <i>not</i> superheroes.

596
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,058
Give me that.

597
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:40,526
What-- What are you doing?

598
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:42,428
Running their images through
a facial recognition app

599
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:44,530
to see if there's any pics
from their past.

600
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:47,533
I got a hit!

601
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,203
Looks like a picture of them
at summer camp eight years ago.

602
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,572
The girl has a crab claw.

603
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,208
Max! That's how I know them!

604
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:58,577
I was their counselor
at Camp Evil Weevil!

605
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,046
- What?
- They're the kids

606
00:28:00,146 --> 00:28:02,581
of Dark Mayhem, King Crab,
and Strongdor.

607
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,583
So the V-Team are villains?

608
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,886
Posing as heroes
to do their evil

609
00:28:06,986 --> 00:28:08,755
from inside
the Hero League.

610
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:10,289
And if I expose them,

611
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:12,658
then President Kickbutt
will fire them and take me back!

612
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:13,926
Where's my old supersuit?

613
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,729
Your supersuit? Uh...

614
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:18,697
Is that it in your cage?

615
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,802
I just used it
as a soothing blankie.

616
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:24,670
But you might want to pop it
in the wash.

617
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:26,405
Yuck!

618
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,176
I better hurry up
and expose them

619
00:28:30,276 --> 00:28:31,510
before Phoebe
figures it out.

620
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:32,779
Yeah, right!

621
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:35,848
Like she's smart enough
to figure it out on her own.

622
00:28:36,983 --> 00:28:38,617
Camp Evil Weevil?

623
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,386
The V-Team are villains!

624
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:43,422
The "V" stands for "Villain."

625
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,292
Better act fast
before Max finds out.

626
00:28:46,993 --> 00:28:49,661
Time for Thunder Girl
to get back her J.O.B.

627
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,832
Dweeb Force, away!

628
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:55,001
Dangit! Now I'm saying it.

629
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:02,074
Can you heat up my pizza, Nora?

630
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:03,675
Sure, Jonah.

631
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:06,913
Can you laser a "Z"
on my locker?

632
00:29:07,013 --> 00:29:08,647
No problem, Zoe.

633
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:13,119
That's so cool.

634
00:29:13,886 --> 00:29:15,587
Hey, I'm Billy.

635
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:17,389
You want some beef jerky?

636
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,597
I guess we're going with powers.

637
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:28,300
I'm Billy Thunderman,

638
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,036
the fastest dude on Earth.

639
00:29:30,837 --> 00:29:33,906
Billy, what are you doing?

640
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:35,975
Who wants to see my powers
in action?

641
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:38,577
Can you get me an Italian ice
from Italy?

642
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,387
Can you super-speed to the top
of Mt. Metroburg?

643
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,790
No way! Look!

644
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:53,725
So, what else do you guys want?

645
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:57,296
Billy, you're stealing
all my friends.

646
00:29:57,396 --> 00:29:58,764
I'm just doing
what you're doing.

647
00:29:58,865 --> 00:30:00,900
Well now, I'm doing this.

648
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,901
Ow!

649
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,311
What in Aunt Sally's Clam Shack
is going on here?

650
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,419
No!

651
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,158
- Oopsie.
- Oopsie.

652
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:28,627
Don't look at me.

653
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:30,096
I'm hideous!

654
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:42,041
Oh, we've been looking
for hours.

655
00:30:42,141 --> 00:30:43,842
The secret item isn't here.

656
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:45,244
It has to be here!

657
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,379
The ancient Hero League book
says it's guarded

658
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:49,115
by the League's
longest-serving hero,

659
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:50,282
and that's Thunderman.

660
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:52,885
Ermahgerd, can you guys mute it?

661
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:54,386
I'm trying to concentrate.

662
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:56,688
You could help, you know.

663
00:30:56,788 --> 00:31:00,059
Mm, ransacking's a lot,
and I'm a princess.

664
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,129
Of what?
Freak Claw Island?

665
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:05,497
Of kicking your
fake British butt!

666
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:07,233
Guys! Guys!

667
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,735
Let's settle this like we
used to at Camp Evil Weevil.

668
00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:11,403
Not rock, paper, lasers!

669
00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:13,339
Too late! Rock, paper, lasers...

670
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:14,873
Ow!

671
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:16,808
Now keep looking!

672
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:40,967
Oh!

673
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,402
- Shh!
- Max, what are you doing here?

674
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:45,004
Stopping the V-Team
without you, so beat it.

675
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:46,538
- No way, you beat it!
- No, you beat it!

676
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:49,275
Someone's coming, let's go.

677
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,381
Ah-ha! I found something.

678
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:58,117
Keys to the Hero League
mega yacht.

679
00:31:58,217 --> 00:32:00,519
- We had a mega yacht?
- Shh!

680
00:32:02,288 --> 00:32:04,656
Key card to the designer
utility belt closet.

681
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,725
We had a designer
utility belt closet?

682
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:08,194
Shh!

683
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:23,409
Hello!

684
00:32:26,845 --> 00:32:29,115
- Is that Blobbin?
- Yup, right on time.

685
00:32:29,215 --> 00:32:31,150
Great!
With that helicopter,

686
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,553
we can spy on Chloe while she
skateboards with her friends.

687
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:37,456
You mean, lovingly watch her
and be the protective parents

688
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:39,391
that she still so clearly needs.

689
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:41,093
Yeah, what you said.

690
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:42,894
Thunderfam!

691
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:45,697
Bring it in, you two.

692
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,467
- Oh!
- Thanks for coming, Blobbin!

693
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:51,970
Oh, of course! When my family
says they need a helicopter,

694
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:53,705
they get a helicopter.

695
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:54,973
Oh!

696
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:57,709
The T-11 Blob-copter
is perfect

697
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,247
for saving that stranded
bald eagle family.

698
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:02,848
- Saving the--
- Yeah...

699
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:05,651
that's what we're using it for,
Barb, remember?

700
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:08,054
We'll return it good as new.

701
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:10,656
Oh, no! It's a gift.

702
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:13,892
I have eighteen more.
I'm very rich.

703
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,527
Yes, I recall.

704
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:18,564
Oh! There's my ride back.

705
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:21,933
It's our latest model,
completely pilotless.

706
00:33:22,034 --> 00:33:23,869
Pilotless? Isn't that dangerous?

707
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:25,271
Oh, no, Barb.

708
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:27,073
Safety comes first at BlobCo.

709
00:33:27,173 --> 00:33:29,275
See, first we drop the ladder...

710
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:31,110
- Oh!
- And then,

711
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,079
I have fifteen seconds
to climb on board

712
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:34,913
before it flies away.

713
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:38,850
Oh, give the family a great
big hug from Cousin Blobbin.

714
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,353
Will do! Thanks, Blobbin!

715
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:45,191
- Bald eagles, Hank?
- Want me to tell him the truth?

716
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:47,059
That we're spying
on our own daughter?

717
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,261
My foot's stuck!

718
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,630
You're probably right.
He wouldn't understand.

719
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,366
Let's go check out our chopper!

720
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:56,235
Hank? Barb?

721
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:57,636
Hank?

722
00:33:57,736 --> 00:33:58,737
Guys?

723
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:00,172
Help!

724
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,944
So far, so good, Barb!

725
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,579
Chloe's got her helmet on

726
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,482
and has no idea
we're watching her.

727
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:12,551
You know,
we really should consider

728
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:14,786
writing a book on parenting.

729
00:34:15,354 --> 00:34:16,355
Too busy!

730
00:34:16,455 --> 00:34:19,191
Chloe needs us 24 hours a day.

731
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:21,093
Yeah, of course.
What was I thinking?

732
00:34:23,262 --> 00:34:25,764
Hey, Cherry.
Yup, send 'em on up.

733
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:26,965
What was that about?

734
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,567
Oh, I ordered some Splat Shakes.

735
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:31,637
Cherry's delivering them
with Mrs. Wong's splat-a-pult.

736
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:32,871
Hank.

737
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:35,841
Two strawberry Splat Shakes,
traveling!

738
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:38,844
Oh! Ah!

739
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:41,247
Hank! What did you do?!

740
00:34:41,347 --> 00:34:43,582
They came at me so fast, Barb!

741
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:46,318
Hank, you short-circuited
the steering.

742
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:49,087
We're gonna have to make
an emergency landing.

743
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:07,072
Mom and Dad?

744
00:35:07,173 --> 00:35:09,975
Chloe! Wh... What a surprise!

745
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:12,178
Look, Barb.

746
00:35:12,278 --> 00:35:13,445
- It's Chloe!
- Oh!

747
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:15,581
Hey, Chloe!

748
00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:18,817
- Are you guys okay?
- Oh, yeah!

749
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:21,853
We're taking the Thunder Copter
out for a little spin.

750
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,690
- R-Right, Barb?
- Yeah, hey, we're all good.

751
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,859
Just resume your unmonitored
skateboarding.

752
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:30,196
Were you guys spying on me?

753
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:31,663
Wh-- Wh--

754
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:32,931
What?

755
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:35,867
No, we are not spying.

756
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,669
This is so embarrassing.

757
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:40,306
Can't I even go skateboarding
with my friends by myself?

758
00:35:40,406 --> 00:35:41,873
You're such helicopter parents.

759
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,175
We are not.

760
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:45,577
You're holding a piece
of helicopter.

761
00:35:46,445 --> 00:35:48,214
Oh, uh...

762
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:50,449
well, that is easy to explain.

763
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:53,252
Um, you see... Um...

764
00:35:53,352 --> 00:35:54,786
Your mom did it!

765
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,633
Well, this is a nice surprise.

766
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:09,401
So, I guess you know our secret.

767
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,870
That you're weird and lame?
Not a secret.

768
00:36:12,738 --> 00:36:14,473
No, that we're the children of--

769
00:36:14,573 --> 00:36:16,408
Dr. Mayhem, King Crab,
and Strongdor?

770
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,176
Also not a secret.

771
00:36:18,277 --> 00:36:20,646
Dang it! Stop knowing things!

772
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:23,982
We also know you framed us
and stole our jobs.

773
00:36:24,082 --> 00:36:25,417
Tell us why.

774
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,018
To get our hands on something
the Hero League

775
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:29,455
has been guarding
for over a hundred years.

776
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:30,722
The Power Plant!

777
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:33,124
- The what now?
- The power who?

778
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:35,093
Don't pretend you don't know
about the Power Plant.

779
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,928
I'm still mad no one told us
about the mega yacht.

780
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,598
And the designer super-belt
collection.

781
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,600
Oh, girl, it's so dope.
I'd show it to you,

782
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,570
but we're probably gonna torture
you or blast you into space

783
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,037
- so what's the point?
- Enough!

784
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,373
Tell them about the plant.

785
00:36:47,473 --> 00:36:49,908
According to
<i>Ye Olde Book of Powers,</i>

786
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:52,110
all of today's superheroes
and villains

787
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,547
can trace their DNA back
to a few ancient villagers,

788
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:58,450
who ate the seeds
of a mysterious plant,

789
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,253
giving them superhuman powers.

790
00:37:01,353 --> 00:37:03,489
How are you British?

791
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:06,558
The Hero League has been
secretly guarding it

792
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:07,993
for centuries.

793
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:09,728
Because in the wrong hands,
a person could create

794
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:12,163
a super-powered army
to do their bidding.

795
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:15,601
So how long were you stuck
to the toilet seats?

796
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:17,603
Two days!

797
00:37:17,703 --> 00:37:19,371
Now tell us where
the Power Plant is,

798
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:20,639
or the swoosh gets it!

799
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,108
Not the swoosh!
Not the swoosh! Please!

800
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:25,210
See, now you know
we're telling the truth.

801
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:27,946
He'd give up his own grandmother
to save his swoosh.

802
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:30,882
I guess Thunder Man knows
how to keep a secret.

803
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:33,385
Looks like we'll have to get it
out of him ourselves.

804
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:35,921
So, what do we do with them?

805
00:37:36,622 --> 00:37:38,824
We'll take them
to the Mayhem Cafe.

806
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:41,993
Mayhem Cafe.
Doesn't sound so bad.

807
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:45,964
Do you ever get tired
of being wrong?

808
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:47,699
Yeah, sometimes.

809
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:49,901
Welcome to my dad's old lair.

810
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:52,704
An homage to his hatred
of the Thundermans.

811
00:37:53,672 --> 00:37:56,274
Oh, how he longed
to trap you all in this booth

812
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:58,377
and inflict its torments on you.

813
00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:00,446
And we had
my birthday parties here.

814
00:38:00,546 --> 00:38:02,848
Those parties
were smashing!

815
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,483
You'll never get away with this.

816
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:07,218
Our family will come looking as
soon as they realize we're gone.

817
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:10,188
Oh? Did you tell them
where you were going?

818
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,258
I knew it.

819
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,962
Families are just a burden
to talents like us.

820
00:38:17,062 --> 00:38:18,163
But don't worry,

821
00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:19,531
we'll say hi for you.

822
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,199
Fire up the jet!

823
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,902
Destination: Hiddenville!

824

Tortures?

828
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:44,255
Like being trapped in here
with you isn't torture enough?

<i>Great. Let's begin.</i>

837
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:05,143
<i>Phoebe,</i>

838
00:39:05,243 --> 00:39:07,646
<i>you've tangled with some</i>

<i>Max's old gym socks?</i>

841
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,856
So this is where my socks went!

842
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,860
It smells like wet dog
dipped in hot trash.

843
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,730
Come on, it's not that bad.

844
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,298
Let's add some lightning
to the mix.

845
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:28,600
Uh, what?

846
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,301
Ow! Ow!

847
00:39:30,402 --> 00:39:32,404
- Ow!
- No! Ow! Oh, my butt!

848
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:34,139
Ah! Ah!

849
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:38,343
Max, your threshold for pain
is high,

850
00:39:38,444 --> 00:39:39,811
but can it withstand

851
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:42,881
Phoebe's middle school
valedictorian speech?

852
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:47,018
<i>And so, as we embark</i>
<i>on our next chapter of life...</i>

853
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:49,387
Ugh! Can I do more lightning
instead?

854
00:39:49,488 --> 00:39:52,791
<i>...let's thank the teachers</i>
<i>who helped us on our journey.</i>

855
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:56,261
<i>Mrs. Cunningham,</i>
<i>who taught us to love calculus.</i>

856
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:57,529
Oh!

857
00:39:57,629 --> 00:39:58,964
Turn it off!

858
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:03,569
<i>Monsieur Dworkin, who made us</i>
<i>say "oui" to French...</i>

859
00:40:03,669 --> 00:40:06,538
No!

860
00:40:11,677 --> 00:40:13,111
How was your day
at the skatepark, Chloe?

861
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:15,213
Mom and Dad spied on me
from a helicopter.

862
00:40:15,313 --> 00:40:17,983
Then crashed in front of all
my friends. How was school?

863
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:20,051
Nora and I used our powers
to compete for friends

864
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:22,187
and then we seared off
the principal's ponytail.

865
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:23,388
- Good talk.
- Yeah.

866
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:26,291
Kids, have you seen Max
and Phoebe?

867
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:27,559
They've been gone all day.

868
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:29,961
Did you try using binoculars?

869
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,099
I told you she was still mad.

870
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:36,568
What's that?

871
00:40:36,668 --> 00:40:38,069
It sounds like the Thunder Jet.

872
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:41,106
<i>Alert! Alert!</i>
<i>V-Team approaching.</i>

873
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:43,041
V-Team?
What are they doing here?

874
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:45,744
Maybe their band is playing
Hiddenville!

875
00:40:49,214 --> 00:40:50,649
Lasering the lock?

876
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:53,218
Classic rock star!

877
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,086
Nobody move!

878
00:40:56,822 --> 00:40:58,824
Dad!

879
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,561
That's the V-Team?

880
00:41:02,661 --> 00:41:04,663
Yup, it sure is.

881
00:41:04,763 --> 00:41:07,465
Hey, guys, it's your old
camp counselor,

882
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:09,200
Dr. Colosso.

883
00:41:09,635 --> 00:41:11,002
Dr. Colosso was a human

884
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:13,371
with beady eyes
and sweating issues.

885
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,642
And you used to have freckles.
What's your point?

886
00:41:16,742 --> 00:41:19,010
Hand over the Power Plant,
Thunder Man!

887
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,613
- Power Plant? Never heard of it.
- No?

888
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:23,749
Maybe this will help you
remember.

889
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:29,487
<i>- Bees, they're everywhere!</i>
<i>- Make it stop!</i>

890
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:31,222
My babies! Hank!

891
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,224
Please, give them
what they want.

892
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,694
If I do,

893
00:41:35,794 --> 00:41:37,763
will you tell us where
Max and Phoebe are?

894
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:39,330
Of course.

895
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:01,687
What is it, Dad?

896
00:42:01,787 --> 00:42:04,522
Something I vowed
to protect forever.

897
00:42:06,892 --> 00:42:08,393
Look at it!

898
00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:10,128
Each red pod teeming with seeds,

899
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:13,565
enough to make
ten thousand supervillains!

900
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:16,467
What if it's a fake?

901
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:18,336
Good point.

902
00:42:18,436 --> 00:42:19,705
Better test it.

903
00:42:19,805 --> 00:42:22,574
Who here doesn't have
superpowers?

904
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:24,843
Nutty!

905
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:26,578
I told you to stay in the lair.

906
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:34,552
You fiend!

907
00:42:34,653 --> 00:42:36,487
He's just a dumb squirrel.

908
00:42:40,726 --> 00:42:43,829
Did I say dumb?
I meant really cool.

909
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:47,198
Whoa!

910
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:48,399
Mad squirrel!

911
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:49,868
Gah!

912
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:55,974
- Yup, it's real.
- To the jet!

913
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:57,976
Wait, what about Max
and Phoebe?

914
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,945
You said you'd tell us
where they are!

915
00:43:00,045 --> 00:43:01,847
We're villains, we lied!

916
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,218
I can't wait
for their new album.

917
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,655
Hank, what do we do?

918
00:43:10,121 --> 00:43:12,523
I'll follow their jet and hope
they lead me to him.

919
00:43:12,624 --> 00:43:14,626

920

00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:39,377
Nothing. I'll try heat breath.

<i>Liquid mercury,</i>

Ew! You want us to hold hands?

Kind of.

Yeah.

Phoebe, I want to apologize.

960

No, not that.

my quest for fame,

it was selfish and annoying.

Oh. Max, it doesn't matter now.

965

No, I want to explain.

966
00:45:41,706 --> 00:45:45,143
The reason I wanted to be famous
was because...

967
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:48,613
because I know you're
a better supe than I am.

968
00:45:48,713 --> 00:45:50,048
What do you mean?

969
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:52,283
See, I can never work
as hard as you

970
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:55,053
and make all those
amazing plans.

971
00:45:55,153 --> 00:45:57,688
I thought, if I couldn't be
as good as you,

972
00:45:57,789 --> 00:46:00,325
maybe I could be more famous.

973
00:46:01,626 --> 00:46:02,928
That's funny.

974
00:46:03,028 --> 00:46:05,496
The whole reason I wanted to be
the best is because of you.

975
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:07,565
What do you mean?

976
00:46:07,665 --> 00:46:09,200
I mean, when you were evil,
it was easy

977
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,069
to be Mom and Dad's
favorite.

978
00:46:11,169 --> 00:46:13,805
Then you became
this great superhero

979
00:46:13,905 --> 00:46:15,640
and I didn't feel as special.

980
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,809
I thought maybe if I could be
the best supe ever,

981
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:20,011
I could get that feeling back.

982
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:22,347
No wonder our family
hated working with us.

983
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:24,115
We were just thinking
of ourselves.

984
00:46:24,215 --> 00:46:26,084
I know, we've both been
a couple of total

985
00:46:26,184 --> 00:46:27,618
party favors.

986
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:30,255
I would have gone with "jerks"
but...

987
00:46:30,355 --> 00:46:33,091
No, Max, look.
A leftover party favor bag

988
00:46:33,191 --> 00:46:34,692
from one of Mayhem Jr.'s
old birthdays.

989
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,694
You know what supervillains
give as party favors?

990
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,663
- Dangerous things.
- Uh-huh!

991
00:46:38,763 --> 00:46:40,298
Maybe our telekinesis can reach.

992
00:46:44,002 --> 00:46:46,271
Jackpot!
Let's see what we've got.

993
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:49,407
- Brass knuckles.
- A vile of poison.

994
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:51,843
Exploding sushi
refrigerator magnet!

995
00:46:51,943 --> 00:46:53,144
Hello!

996
00:46:53,244 --> 00:46:55,146
I bet the fish eggs
contain nitroglycerin.

997
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:57,315
Hang on, this might get messy.

998
00:47:08,927 --> 00:47:10,095
We did it!

999
00:47:10,195 --> 00:47:12,163
Dark Mayhem could never
outsmart us.

1000
00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:13,932
<i>- Unauthorized escape.</i>

1001
00:47:14,032 --> 00:47:16,734
<i>Instituting emergency protocol.</i>

1002
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:21,306
<i>Lair will self-destruct</i>
<i>in 20 minutes.</i>

1003
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:25,110
Unless he rigged his lair
to blow up.

1004
00:47:30,015 --> 00:47:32,250
Here, Hank,
it's a bag of frozen peas.

1005
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,319
Oh, thanks. I'm starving.

1006
00:47:35,053 --> 00:47:36,487
They're for your head.

1007
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:39,690
Boy, that must have been
some hit.

1008
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,459
The dome's too strong, Barb.

1009
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:43,761
Chloe can't even teleport out.

1010
00:47:44,495 --> 00:47:46,231
Hey, look what I found.

1011
00:47:46,331 --> 00:47:48,433
A blue seed pod?

1012
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:52,070
Must have fallen off the Power
Plant when the V-Team ran out.

1013
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:54,005
If the red ones make
supervillains,

1014
00:47:54,105 --> 00:47:55,806
do the blue ones make
superheroes?

1015
00:47:55,907 --> 00:47:58,043
They do. Wait a minute.

1016
00:47:58,476 --> 00:48:01,146
Are you saying what I think
you're saying?

1017
00:48:02,013 --> 00:48:04,916
<i>Don't panic,</i>
<i>Billy, you got this.</i>

1018
00:48:05,016 --> 00:48:06,651
<i>It's just a simple yes or no.</i>

1019
00:48:06,751 --> 00:48:08,786
<i>You have half a chance</i>
<i>of being right.</i>

1020
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:11,522
Albuquerque!

1021
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:16,027
Hank,
where is the nearest place

1022
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,495
that the dome
touches the ground?

1023
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:20,165
Uh, the city limits
in Hiddenville Park.

1024
00:48:20,265 --> 00:48:22,033
Kids, gather everyone we know

1025
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:23,468
and meet us in the park.

1026
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:25,937
Tell them we need their help
to save Max and Phoebe.

1027
00:48:26,037 --> 00:48:27,105
- Right.
- Right!

1028
00:48:27,205 --> 00:48:29,174
Albuquerque!

1029
00:48:35,446 --> 00:48:37,015
Hello, Animal Control?

1030
00:48:37,115 --> 00:48:38,483
I am a human homeowner

1031
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:40,618
with a bit
of a squirrel problem.

1032
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:42,753
Is it urgent?

1033
00:48:44,822 --> 00:48:46,191
Yeah, you might say that.

1034
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:53,031
Excuse me. Thanks for coming,
everyone.

1035
00:48:53,131 --> 00:48:55,066
What's this all about,
Thunderman?

1036
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:56,467
I'll tell you what it's about.

1037
00:48:56,567 --> 00:48:59,104
These super-dummies are back
for two days

1038
00:48:59,204 --> 00:49:01,506
and suddenly we live
in a snow globe.

1039
00:49:02,107 --> 00:49:03,474
I don't have time to explain,

1040
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:06,277
but Max and Phoebe
are in mortal danger.

1041
00:49:06,377 --> 00:49:07,345
They need your help.

1042
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:09,180
Dude, say no more.

1043
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,982
- I'm in.
- Me too.

1044
00:49:11,082 --> 00:49:13,251
Anything for Barb.

1045
00:49:14,552 --> 00:49:16,954
Why should we help Max
and Phoebe?

1046
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,656
They're so annoying!

1047
00:49:18,756 --> 00:49:22,127
Yeah, their mini-me
zapped off my ponytail.

1048
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:24,829
And now Janet says
she wants to...

1049
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:26,464
take a break.

1050
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:28,866
Come on. Let's go!

1051
00:49:31,936 --> 00:49:33,638
Hey! Listen up.

1052
00:49:33,738 --> 00:49:36,774
Max and Phoebe have always
been there for you guys.

1053
00:49:36,874 --> 00:49:37,942
Don't you even remember?

1054
00:49:38,043 --> 00:49:39,277
I do.

1055
00:49:39,377 --> 00:49:41,146
Like that time
they saved the prom.

1056
00:49:41,246 --> 00:49:42,513
And kept that Candy girl

1057
00:49:42,613 --> 00:49:44,615
from turning the town
into mindless zombies.

1058
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:46,884
Oh, I was gonna say
the prom one,

1059
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,519
but there's probably others.

1060
00:49:49,854 --> 00:49:52,023
So now it's your turn
to help them.

1061
00:49:52,123 --> 00:49:53,991
So quit being a bunch
of weenies,

1062
00:49:54,092 --> 00:49:55,726
and get with the program.

1063
00:49:58,696 --> 00:50:00,365
Fine!

1064
00:50:00,898 --> 00:50:02,300
Whatever!

1065
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,869
I don't have a ponytail anymore,
so who cares?

1066
00:50:06,304 --> 00:50:07,305
So what do you need from us?

1067
00:50:07,405 --> 00:50:08,373
I just need you guys

1068
00:50:08,473 --> 00:50:09,540
to open up your mouths

1069
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,476
for the next few seconds.

1070
00:50:11,576 --> 00:50:13,544
I knew they'd make it weird.

1071
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,047
Ready?

1072
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:23,888
Another Thunderman floppo.

1073
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:25,456
Well, back to my horrible life.

1074
00:50:28,093 --> 00:50:30,228
What the-- My pants just ripped!

1075
00:50:30,328 --> 00:50:33,098
Aah!

1076
00:50:33,198 --> 00:50:34,432
Ah!

1077
00:50:35,233 --> 00:50:38,803
Holy handballs, I'm huge!

1078
00:50:39,837 --> 00:50:41,639
And blue!

1079
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:44,809
I have an iron fist!

1080
00:50:47,345 --> 00:50:50,448
Oh! My fingers shoot
pretty sparkles!

1081
00:50:54,652 --> 00:50:58,055
Ah! I'm a human tornado!

1082
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,662
I have awesome power burps.

1083
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:07,798
- It worked!
- Okay, everyone,

1084
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,900
we need to concentrate
our powers on the dome

1085
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,169
and try to bust it open.

1086
00:51:11,269 --> 00:51:14,705
Come on, everyone gather.
Gather! Good.

1087
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:17,074
And... Hit it!

1088
00:51:27,452 --> 00:51:29,520
I think it's working!

1089
00:51:36,161 --> 00:51:37,995
Guys, we did it!

1090
00:51:38,863 --> 00:51:41,031
Thundermans, assemble!

1091
00:51:42,567 --> 00:51:44,935
Chloe, do you think
you could teleport us all

1092
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:46,036
back to Metroburg?

1093
00:51:46,137 --> 00:51:47,905
I think so. Everyone hold hands.

1094
00:51:53,644 --> 00:51:56,947
<i>Self-destruct in 45 seconds.</i>

1095
00:51:58,416 --> 00:52:00,685
Max, I found the keypad
to the security system,

1096
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:02,119
but it requires a password.

1097
00:52:03,288 --> 00:52:04,722
I'll try "evil."

1098
00:52:04,822 --> 00:52:06,457
Nothing.

1099
00:52:06,557 --> 00:52:09,360
Try "Beyonce."
Who doesn't like Beyonce?

1100
00:52:10,895 --> 00:52:13,898
Still nothing.
Plus, I feel dumber.

1101
00:52:15,233 --> 00:52:16,601
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

1102
00:52:17,101 --> 00:52:18,636
Any chance this is just
a horrible dream?

1103
00:52:18,736 --> 00:52:20,271
We'll know in eighteen seconds.

1104
00:52:20,938 --> 00:52:23,641
There they are!

1105
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:27,912
This place is about to blow up.
We don't know the password.

1106
00:52:28,012 --> 00:52:30,515
What? Grab our hands.
We'll teleport out of here.

1107
00:52:30,615 --> 00:52:32,917
We can't! It takes me a minute
to recharge.

1108
00:52:33,017 --> 00:52:35,420
<i>- Five... four... three...</i>
- Password, huh?

1109
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,788
<i>- ...two... one...</i>
- Think I might know it.

1110
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:42,993
<i>System punched.</i>
<i>Sequence canceled.</i>

1111
00:52:44,295 --> 00:52:46,464
- Oh!
- Yeah!

1112
00:52:46,564 --> 00:52:48,999
Dad, you did it!

1113
00:52:49,867 --> 00:52:51,336
But how did you guys find us?

1114
00:52:51,436 --> 00:52:53,103
Well, it was the only
building in town

1115
00:52:53,204 --> 00:52:54,672
with a neon sign saying,

1116
00:52:54,772 --> 00:52:56,741
"Die, Thundermans, die," so.

1117
00:52:57,275 --> 00:53:00,311
Guys, why didn't you tell us
the V-Team were villains?

1118
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:02,046
We should have.
We were so desperate

1119
00:53:02,146 --> 00:53:04,682
to get our glory back,
we weren't thinking straight.

1120
00:53:04,782 --> 00:53:07,618
We totally get why you didn't
want to work with us before.

1121
00:53:08,419 --> 00:53:09,654
Could you ever forgive us?

1122
00:53:09,754 --> 00:53:11,622
Let me guess, you thought
you were gonna die,

1123
00:53:11,722 --> 00:53:13,324
admitted a bunch of personal
stuff to each other?

1124
00:53:13,424 --> 00:53:14,759
- Exactly.
- Pretty much.

1125
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:17,595
Yes, of course we forgive you.

1126
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,830
But, guys, we have to stop
the V-Team

1127
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:21,432
from creating an army
of villains.

1128
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,968
They got the Power Plant?
We have to find them!

1129
00:53:24,068 --> 00:53:26,804
Well, if I wanted to rain seeds
down on everyone,

1130
00:53:26,904 --> 00:53:29,274
I'd start at the highest point
in Metroburg.

1131
00:53:29,374 --> 00:53:31,041
Where's that?

1132
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:32,510
<i>You know this, Billy.</i>

1133
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:35,212
<i>It was on the sign that you got</i>
<i>for that kid.</i>

1134
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:36,847
<i>Think.</i>

1135
00:53:36,947 --> 00:53:37,915
<i>Think!</i>

1136
00:53:38,649 --> 00:53:40,618
The highest point in Metroburg
is Mt. Metroburg,

1137
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:43,821
with an elevation
of 14,220 feet.

1138
00:53:47,091 --> 00:53:49,727
Guys, why is everyone
just standing around?

1139
00:53:49,827 --> 00:53:50,728
Quiet.

1140
00:53:50,828 --> 00:53:53,163
We're savoring the moment.

1141
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:03,874
I've finished grinding the seeds
into dust.

1142
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:05,443
Place it in the containment
hatch.

1143
00:54:05,543 --> 00:54:07,578
What's the magic word?

1144
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,716
Right away.

1145
00:54:14,385 --> 00:54:15,986
You broke us out of prison

1146
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,022
to sit on a freezing
mountaintop?

1147
00:54:18,122 --> 00:54:20,391
Strongdor doesn't like missing
bingo night.

1148
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:22,192
Strongdor like bingo.

1149
00:54:22,793 --> 00:54:23,928
We brought you here
so you can see

1150
00:54:24,028 --> 00:54:26,431
what a real evil plan
looks like.

1151
00:54:26,531 --> 00:54:28,999
Oh! They're doing
our Macarena thing.

1152
00:54:30,801 --> 00:54:33,003
No, we're launching a drone

1153
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,606
to rain red-powdered seeds
down on everyone,

1154
00:54:35,706 --> 00:54:38,208
and morph them
into an army of supervillains!

1155
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:40,244
I guess that's pretty cool.

1156
00:54:41,145 --> 00:54:43,681
Then we three will subjugate
the superheroes of the world

1157
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:45,650
and rule like emperors!

1158
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,685
And give your dads cushy jobs?

1159
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:50,888
Oh, let me think about that. No.

1160
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:54,725
Wow, Mayhem, your kid <i>hates</i> you.

1161
00:54:55,393 --> 00:54:56,461
Shut it, Dad.

1162
00:54:56,561 --> 00:54:58,463
You don't always
have to say things.

1163
00:54:59,096 --> 00:55:01,599
Do not snap that claw at me,
young lady.

1164
00:55:01,699 --> 00:55:04,335
Anyway, I recalibrated
the thrust transducers

1165
00:55:04,435 --> 00:55:06,170
so we can rule the world
and junk.

1166
00:55:07,071 --> 00:55:08,272
Excellent!

1167
00:55:08,373 --> 00:55:11,642
Let the era of villainy begin!

1168
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:17,882
Step away from the drone,
V-Team.

1169
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:19,316
- Thundermans!
- Thundermans!

1170
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:20,818
- Dark Mayhem!
- Electress!

1171
00:55:20,918 --> 00:55:23,721
- King Crab?
- And me, Strongdor!

1172
00:55:24,589 --> 00:55:26,323
Attack on my order!

1173
00:55:26,424 --> 00:55:27,725
No, Dad, this is our thing!

1174
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:30,160
Yes, the Thundermans
will just spank your bottoms

1175
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,596
like they always do.

1176
00:55:31,696 --> 00:55:33,063
Hey, our bottoms are firm.

1177
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,966
We take spin class with
Warden Patty three days a week.

1178
00:55:37,635 --> 00:55:39,470
Thundermans, attack!

1179
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,609
It's been a long time, Max.

1180
00:55:44,709 --> 00:55:47,177
- Not long enough.
- Aw, come now.

1181
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:48,413
Don't you want to...

1182
00:55:48,513 --> 00:55:49,814
catch up?

1183
00:55:56,454 --> 00:55:57,688
How'd you escape my dad's lair?

1184
00:55:57,788 --> 00:56:00,290
'Cause I'm a superhero,
not a brat with a mask.

1185
00:56:02,427 --> 00:56:03,961
Nice mask.

1186
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,506
Mom, I wanna help.

1187
00:56:15,606 --> 00:56:16,807
No, sweetie, it's too dangerous.

1188
00:56:16,907 --> 00:56:19,043
Stay back here and don't move.

1189
00:56:19,143 --> 00:56:21,211
Have at you, sir.

1190
00:56:26,183 --> 00:56:30,655
Your super-punches are no match
for this barnacled beauty.

1191
00:56:33,458 --> 00:56:34,925
Ugh!

1192
00:56:37,495 --> 00:56:40,565
I can't fight you. I shoot
electricity from my hands.

1193
00:56:40,665 --> 00:56:42,066
All you have is a claw.

1194
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:45,335
Oh, you're right.
I better do this.

1195
00:56:54,845 --> 00:56:56,547
I wonder if they like slap tag.

1196
00:57:07,224 --> 00:57:09,660
Billy, we can't keep
doing this forever.

1197
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,161
Let's hope they don't know that.

1198
00:57:17,034 --> 00:57:17,835
Aah!

1199
00:57:23,474 --> 00:57:25,009
Ah! Oh!

1200
00:57:30,347 --> 00:57:32,382
Look around, Thunder Girl,

1201
00:57:32,483 --> 00:57:33,918
your family is doomed.

1202
00:57:37,655 --> 00:57:40,190
And they get to watch you
go first.

1203
00:57:43,528 --> 00:57:45,295
I can do this all night.

1204
00:57:56,774 --> 00:57:59,209
Say your prayers, Thunder Man.

1205
00:58:04,682 --> 00:58:05,850
Whoa!

1206
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:09,720
Going ice skating?

1207
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,789
No, but you are.

1208
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:30,074
Mom, hold out your hands.

1209
00:58:32,142 --> 00:58:34,411
<i>- * Let's kill tonight *</i>

1210
00:58:35,412 --> 00:58:37,882
<i>* Kill tonight *</i>

1211
00:58:37,982 --> 00:58:42,086
<i>* Show them all</i>
<i>you're not the ordinary type *</i>

1212
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,521
- What the--
<i>- * Let's kill tonight *</i>

1213
00:58:44,622 --> 00:58:46,190
I hate where this is going.

1214
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:47,792
Oh!

1215
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,663
First no bingo,
now meat in face.

1216
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,600
This was your plan,
to make them even madder?

1217
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:58,035
It'll work. Just wait for it.

1218
00:58:58,969 --> 00:59:01,205
- Billy!
- Wait!

1219
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:03,007
Now!

1220
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:04,575
Whoa!

1221
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,448
Max!

1222
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:14,151
Oh!

1223
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:17,121
- Thanks, partner.
- Yeah.

1224
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:19,356
- Your swoosh is messy.
- Don't care.

1225
00:59:19,456 --> 00:59:20,224
Let's finish this.

1226
00:59:20,324 --> 00:59:23,661
<i>* Let's kill tonight *</i>

1227
00:59:23,761 --> 00:59:25,830
<i>* Kill tonight *</i>

1228
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:28,699
<i>* Let's kill tonight *</i>

1229
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:31,135
<i>* Kill tonight *</i>

1230
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:35,339
<i>* Show them all</i>
<i>you're not the ordinary type *</i>

1231
00:59:36,206 --> 00:59:38,008
<i>* Let's kill tonight *</i>

1232
00:59:38,108 --> 00:59:39,109
Oh!

1233
00:59:42,446 --> 00:59:44,014
Guys, we did it!

1234
00:59:44,114 --> 00:59:45,883
- Hey, hey!
- See?

1235
00:59:45,983 --> 00:59:48,185
Nothing's stronger than family.

1236
00:59:48,285 --> 00:59:50,788
Except... evil!

1237
00:59:50,888 --> 00:59:52,389
No!

1238
00:59:59,563 --> 01:00:01,699
Dad, catch it before
it releases all the seeds.

1239
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:04,001
I can't,
it's twice as fast as me.

1240
01:00:06,203 --> 01:00:07,872
What's the point, Max?

1241
01:00:07,972 --> 01:00:09,173
I already won.

1242
01:00:11,308 --> 01:00:15,479
I can't believe I put you
in my Bath Time Mix.

1243
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:18,749
We have to do something.

1244
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:20,184
If those seeds are released,
they'll create

1245
01:00:20,284 --> 01:00:21,719
tens of thousands
of supervillains

1246
01:00:21,819 --> 01:00:23,353
and this world turns evil
forever.

1247
01:00:24,922 --> 01:00:26,957
- I can do it.
- Do what, Chloe?

1248
01:00:27,057 --> 01:00:28,325
Teleport someone to the drone.

1249
01:00:28,425 --> 01:00:31,261
- What?
- No. No, out of the question.

1250
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:33,864
Guys, I'm ready.

1251
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:36,000
And I'm a Thunderman.

1252
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,902
It's what we do.

1253
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:39,569
Remind you of anyone?

1254
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:41,005
Yeah.

1255
01:00:41,772 --> 01:00:43,507
- Guys, I believe her.
- Me, too.

1256
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:46,076
She wants to save the world,
Barb.

1257
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:49,146
Okay, but your father and I
are going with you.

1258
01:00:49,246 --> 01:00:50,781
- No, no way. I'm going.
- Max!

1259
01:00:50,881 --> 01:00:54,184
Dad, that's an X-terra 5 drone,
okay? I know how it's wired.

1260
01:00:54,284 --> 01:00:56,220
And, Phoebe,
I'll need your telekinesis.

1261
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,288
To retrieve the seed container
and bring it back to Dad.

1262
01:00:58,388 --> 01:00:59,656
I don't know.

1263
01:00:59,757 --> 01:01:02,559
Uh, guys?
Evil drone flying away?

1264
01:01:03,427 --> 01:01:04,561
Come on.

1265
01:01:05,763 --> 01:01:07,431
We love you guys.

1266
01:01:07,531 --> 01:01:09,033
We love you too.

1267
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,976
Great job, Chloe!
Hold on to that while we work.

1268
01:01:19,076 --> 01:01:20,711
I'll disable the power.

1269
01:01:20,811 --> 01:01:22,046
That'll release
the seed container

1270
01:01:22,146 --> 01:01:23,948
- so you can tele-k it out!
- Got it!

1271
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:35,960
- You're good!
- Okay!

1272
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,698
- Got it!
- Okay, let's get out of here.

1273
01:01:41,799 --> 01:01:43,834
Without power, this thing's
gonna crash any second.

1274
01:01:46,236 --> 01:01:47,604
I can't see anything.

1275
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:50,074
Phoebe!

1276
01:01:51,275 --> 01:01:53,844
I can't teleport us
unless we're all touching!

1277
01:01:53,944 --> 01:01:55,880
Phoebe, hurry,
we're going down fast!

1278
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:57,514
Max, take the seeds!

1279
01:01:59,316 --> 01:02:01,551
- Got 'em!
- Go without me!

1280
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:04,388
- What? No, we're not leaving!
- Don't be ridiculous.

1281
01:02:04,488 --> 01:02:06,356
Take Chloe and the seeds,
get back to the family.

1282
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:09,326
Not gonna happen!
We're not a family without you!

1283
01:02:10,928 --> 01:02:13,130
I'll reach out!
Try to touch my hand.

1284
01:02:14,398 --> 01:02:15,299
Phoebe!

1285
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:24,374
No. Please, no.

1286
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:25,575
Hank...

1287
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:31,348
Kids! What--

1288
01:02:31,448 --> 01:02:34,819
Chloe, you did it!
You saved the world!

1289
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:37,187
- Here's these, Dad.
- Oh.

1290
01:02:37,287 --> 01:02:40,024
Also, I was wrong.

1291
01:02:40,124 --> 01:02:42,059
This one's gonna be
the best supe ever.

1292
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:45,295
- You guys tied up the villains.
- Yeah, we did.

1293
01:02:45,395 --> 01:02:46,897
Can we go hit stuff
with their hammers?

1294
01:02:46,997 --> 01:02:49,099
- Of course.
- Go nuts.

1295
01:02:50,835 --> 01:02:53,337
- Good job, Chloe.
- Thanks, Dad.

1296
01:02:53,437 --> 01:02:55,339
We're sorry we treated you
like a little kid.

1297
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:57,574
It's just...
you're growing up so fast,

1298
01:02:57,674 --> 01:02:59,576
we were afraid
you didn't need us anymore.

1299
01:02:59,676 --> 01:03:03,247
I'll always need you guys.
No matter how big I get.

1300
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:07,117
How come we never
talk like that?

1301
01:03:07,217 --> 01:03:09,920
- Because... shut up!
- Are you kidding me?

1302
01:03:14,859 --> 01:03:16,493
Five, six, seven.

1303
01:03:16,593 --> 01:03:18,362
- Oh!
- Up top!

1304
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:20,630
Yeah!
Five hundred gumdrops, buddy.

1305
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:24,268
Thunder chili is served.

1306
01:03:26,603 --> 01:03:29,739
Billy, we just got invited
to our first high school party.

1307
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,408
- Cool!
- Can I come?

1308
01:03:32,776 --> 01:03:35,279
Just kidding. Text me the deets.

1309
01:03:37,081 --> 01:03:39,049
You know,
I hate to admit it,

1310
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:41,285
but I missed you guys
when you were gone.

1311
01:03:41,385 --> 01:03:44,121
- Even you, Hank.
- Thanks, Colosso.

1312
01:03:44,221 --> 01:03:46,123
And you missed me too, right?

1313
01:03:46,223 --> 01:03:48,825
Thanks, Colosso.

1314
01:03:49,493 --> 01:03:52,696
<i>Alert! Alert!</i>
<i>President Kickbutt approaching.</i>

1315
01:03:52,796 --> 01:03:54,331
What now?

1316
01:03:57,334 --> 01:04:00,204
Sorry to interrupt your evening,
Thundermans.

1317
01:04:00,304 --> 01:04:02,572
I've come to apologize.

1318
01:04:03,307 --> 01:04:04,608
- Really?
- Yes.

1319
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:06,977
Firing the best superheroes
in the Hero League

1320
01:04:07,077 --> 01:04:09,513
was the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

1321
01:04:09,613 --> 01:04:12,883
And I once had dinner
with Inside-Out Man.

1322
01:04:14,919 --> 01:04:17,254
We understand. Rules are rules.

1323
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:19,756
The rules said I had to fire you

1324
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,391
for injuring a fellow supe.

1325
01:04:21,491 --> 01:04:25,395
But since the V-Team
weren't actually supes,

1326
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:28,365
I'd like to offer you
your jobs back.

1327
01:04:28,465 --> 01:04:30,734
If... you'll take them back.

1328
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,141
We'll do it under one condition.

1329
01:04:37,241 --> 01:04:38,675
I'll name Phoebe my VP

1330
01:04:38,775 --> 01:04:42,279
and have a team of stylists
available to Max 24/7.

1331
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:44,681
Not that, but thank you.

1332
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:49,186
We'd like this house to be
the new T-Force headquarters.

1333
01:04:49,286 --> 01:04:51,788
So we can always
put family first.

1334
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:54,791
Well,

1335
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:57,394
this is highly unusual...

1336
01:04:58,162 --> 01:05:01,831
and I'm honored to welcome the
T-Force back to the Hero League!

1337
01:05:03,867 --> 01:05:06,203
I'll have your badges and suits
delivered in the morning.

1338
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,437
And the keys to the mega yacht.

1339
01:05:07,537 --> 01:05:09,006
And designer utility belt
collection.

1340
01:05:09,106 --> 01:05:10,407
All right!

1341
01:05:10,507 --> 01:05:12,009
Which one of you blabbermouths

1342
01:05:12,109 --> 01:05:13,577
spilled the beans?

1343
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:17,881
Thunder Monitor?

1344
01:05:17,982 --> 01:05:19,783
<i>Way ahead of you.</i>

1345
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:24,788
- And where were we?
- Let's get that chili going.

1346
01:05:24,888 --> 01:05:26,056
- Yeah!
- Yeah, let's!

1347
01:05:26,156 --> 01:05:27,657
Hang on.
Does anyone else

1348
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,027
have the feeling
that we forgot something?

1349
01:05:32,997 --> 01:05:34,298
What was that?

1350
01:05:39,836 --> 01:05:42,039
The Blue Hunk,

1351
01:05:42,139 --> 01:05:44,541
reporting for duty.

1352
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:47,244
Don't forget Iron Punch.

1353
01:05:47,344 --> 01:05:49,479
Ow! That was my foot.

1354
01:05:51,515 --> 01:05:54,251
Hey! You blew out my sparkles!

1355
01:05:57,354 --> 01:05:59,556
Where is everybody?

1356
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:01,491
This might be a problem.

1357
01:06:01,591 --> 01:06:03,293
One we can deal with later?

1358
01:06:07,431 --> 01:06:09,266
Great! Back to Family Night.

1359
01:06:09,366 --> 01:06:10,534
- How about that chili?
- Let's go!

1360
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:11,835
- Me first!
- Chili time!

1361
01:06:11,935 --> 01:06:14,371
I call butt groove!

1362
01:06:28,852 --> 01:06:31,121
<i>We've been</i>
<i>watching you, Colosso.</i>

1363
01:06:31,855 --> 01:06:33,590
<i>My colleagues and I</i>
<i>were wondering</i>

1364
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:37,261
<i>if you'd be interested</i>
<i>in a little assignment.</i>

1365
01:06:37,361 --> 01:06:39,496
I'm listening.
