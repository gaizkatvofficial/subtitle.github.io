1
00:01:42,994 --> 00:01:45,236
Another glass of...

2
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:47,601
...rosé?

3
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:52,738
No.
The hour is long past.

4
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:53,805
Check.

5
00:01:58,042 --> 00:01:59,074
Check!

6
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,806
The case, Santos.

7
00:02:27,806 --> 00:02:30,006
My case. Stand back!

8
00:02:30,006 --> 00:02:31,348
Do not advance!

9
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:32,976
The case, Santos.

10
00:02:32,976 --> 00:02:35,187
Halt! Evildoer.

11
00:02:35,187 --> 00:02:37,486
The case, Santos.

12
00:02:37,486 --> 00:02:40,654
Not on your life, waiter.

13
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,798
Oh, God.

14
00:03:19,057 --> 00:03:20,122
Go.

15
00:03:45,257 --> 00:03:46,984
Oh, Jamie!

16
00:03:46,984 --> 00:03:48,920
<i>Neither Sukie
nor Jamie are here right now.</i>

17
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,262
<i>Leave a message.</i>

18
00:03:50,262 --> 00:03:51,626
<i>Hey, Jamie.</i>

19
00:03:51,626 --> 00:03:53,122
<i>Are you there?</i>

20
00:03:53,122 --> 00:03:54,992
<i>Just wondering,
are you and Sukie</i>

21
00:03:54,992 --> 00:03:57,060
- <i>going to shot night tonight?</i>
- Oh, my God!

22
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,337
<i>I don't want to be
stuck there not knowing anyone.</i>

23
00:03:59,337 --> 00:04:00,470
<i>Maybe Carla's going.</i>

24
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,966
<i>Do you know if Carla's going?</i>

25
00:04:01,966 --> 00:04:03,033
Are you going?

26
00:04:04,408 --> 00:04:05,607
<i>Anyway,
call me if you would.</i>

27
00:04:05,607 --> 00:04:07,070
Come on, back to mama.

28
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,808
<i>Hope you and Sukie
are doing well.</i>

29
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:10,777
<i>Miss you, friend. It's Marian.</i>

30
00:04:13,782 --> 00:04:15,353
Hey. Marian.

31
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,685
Hi, Bart.

32
00:04:17,685 --> 00:04:20,655
Say, what are you doing
tomorrow night?

33
00:04:20,655 --> 00:04:22,118
There's a Phish concert.

34
00:04:22,118 --> 00:04:23,460
What?

35
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,396
Phish concert.

36
00:04:25,396 --> 00:04:27,695
Great jam band,
at the Civic Center.

37
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:30,258
Yeah, oh, I...

38
00:04:30,258 --> 00:04:31,259
P-H.

39
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,404
I know how to spell Phish.

40
00:04:33,404 --> 00:04:35,197
Y-Yeah, of course.
I didn't mean to...

41
00:04:35,197 --> 00:04:37,903
- Y-You know, I just meant...
- Sorry, I have an engagement.

42
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,169
Okay. Bummer.

43
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:42,171
Didn't mean to, you know...

44
00:04:42,171 --> 00:04:43,447
That's fine.

45
00:04:43,447 --> 00:04:45,383
Anyhoo, what about...

46
00:04:45,383 --> 00:04:47,418
Please don't use
that expression.

47
00:04:47,418 --> 00:04:49,354
- What expression?
-"Anyhoo."

48
00:04:49,354 --> 00:04:51,719
It's not an expression.

49
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:53,391
What is it?

50
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:56,053
A word.

51
00:04:56,053 --> 00:04:58,055
Please don't use that word.

52
00:04:58,055 --> 00:05:00,596
Okay. You-you free Wednesday?

53
00:05:00,596 --> 00:05:01,993
Plus, it's not even a word.
Not really.

54
00:05:01,993 --> 00:05:03,632
Okay, sure.
Free for dinner Wednesday?

55
00:05:03,632 --> 00:05:05,502
There's a new place
near me, Montana's.

56
00:05:05,502 --> 00:05:07,031
It's very good.

57
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:08,901
Yeah, the food is trendy,
but it's super gourmet.

58
00:05:08,901 --> 00:05:11,310
No, I have an engagement
Wednesday.

59
00:05:12,137 --> 00:05:14,379
Okay. Huh. Wednesday, too.

60
00:05:15,844 --> 00:05:18,878
People don't usually
call them "engagements."

61
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:21,485
Do I tell you how to speak?

62
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:23,883
Yes.

63
00:05:23,883 --> 00:05:25,588
The fact remains.

64
00:05:25,588 --> 00:05:26,985
The engagement.

65
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:28,624
That's right.

66
00:05:51,108 --> 00:05:52,274
Oh, my.

67
00:05:52,274 --> 00:05:54,012
Oh, my God. Oh!

68
00:05:55,015 --> 00:05:56,311
My God!

69
00:06:02,218 --> 00:06:04,726
<i>Neither Sukie
nor Jamie are here right now.</i>

70
00:06:04,726 --> 00:06:06,992
<i>Leave a message.</i>

71
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,159
Jesus, Marian,
don't call me during sex.

72
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:10,732
Yes, I am going tonight.

73
00:06:10,732 --> 00:06:12,294
<i>During sex?</i>

74
00:06:13,537 --> 00:06:15,132
- Hi, Sukie.
<i>- Wow.</i>

75
00:06:17,805 --> 00:06:19,708
- Who? Here?
<i>- Yes, there.</i>

76
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,480
Oh, no one's here, babe.

77
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,373
- I was just masturbating.
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>

78
00:06:25,373 --> 00:06:26,616
Me... me time.

79
00:06:28,585 --> 00:06:30,686
Let me turn the video down.

80
00:06:41,831 --> 00:06:42,764
No.

81
00:06:42,764 --> 00:06:44,700
- What?
- No.

82
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:46,537
No what, Carla?

83
00:06:46,537 --> 00:06:48,066
You're not wearing that.

84
00:06:49,135 --> 00:06:51,333
- I just came from work.
- I came from Toledo.

85
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,510
I don't dress like it.

86
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,842
- Is Jamie here?
- Okay, look.

87
00:06:54,842 --> 00:06:57,108
Keep the coat on.
Take the shirt off underneath.

88
00:06:57,108 --> 00:06:58,714
And flaunt my breasts?

89
00:06:58,714 --> 00:07:00,551
I'm not here to peddle my wares.

90
00:07:00,551 --> 00:07:02,014
Why else would you be here?

91
00:07:02,014 --> 00:07:03,620
To socialize.

92
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,215
Hello, girls.

93
00:07:06,524 --> 00:07:10,352
All I hear lately is "Y2K, Y2K."

94
00:07:10,352 --> 00:07:12,354
But Jamie Dobbs
is here to say...

95
00:07:12,354 --> 00:07:14,422
Why not 2K?

96
00:07:16,325 --> 00:07:18,426
New millennium, bring it on.

97
00:07:20,131 --> 00:07:24,366
Oh, yeah. It's the last
body shot competition of 1999

98
00:07:24,366 --> 00:07:25,840
here at Sugar 'n Spice,

99
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,205
and Jamie is
last month's winner,

100
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:30,581
so we are gonna salt you up.

101
00:07:32,044 --> 00:07:34,211
Show us where
the first lick goes, babe.

102
00:07:34,211 --> 00:07:36,785
So, first lick...

103
00:07:39,086 --> 00:07:40,382
Here.

104
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,693
God, look at that slut.

105
00:07:43,693 --> 00:07:44,760
Oh. Hi, Sukie.

106
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,421
Don't put that woman

107
00:07:46,421 --> 00:07:48,291
in front of a crowd
with a microphone.

108
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:51,602
- And then second lick...
- Well, she likes to entertain.

109
00:07:51,602 --> 00:07:53,703
Ooh!
Take it off! Take it off!

110
00:07:55,331 --> 00:07:56,464
Here.

111
00:07:58,466 --> 00:08:00,270
And then she gets
this reinforcement.

112
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,976
- And then third lick...
- Do you know who she's fucking?

113
00:08:02,976 --> 00:08:04,714
I don't know that
she's seeing anyone.

114
00:08:04,714 --> 00:08:06,309
She's seeing you, of course.

115
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:08,179
Can I have your shirt?

116
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:09,521
Here.

117
00:08:11,314 --> 00:08:12,722
She's a free spirit.

118
00:08:12,722 --> 00:08:14,152
I admire her.

119
00:08:14,152 --> 00:08:15,857
Free.
Yeah, that's the problem.

120
00:08:15,857 --> 00:08:18,453
Put a meter on her pussy,
we could all retire!

121
00:08:18,453 --> 00:08:19,762
That's not fair, Sukie.

122
00:08:19,762 --> 00:08:24,899
And a lime wedge... right here!

123
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:28,430
Pull that out!

124
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,740
That is not a public receptacle!

125
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,105
- Somebody's gonna get hit.
- Oh. Hi, Sukie.

126
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,308
I've had it with love.

127
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:40,915
I know bards and troubadours
are high on it,

128
00:08:40,915 --> 00:08:42,851
but I don't believe
it's relevant to the modern

129
00:08:42,851 --> 00:08:45,282
20th-- soon-to-be 21st--
century lesbian.

130
00:08:45,282 --> 00:08:47,185
Here are some carrots.
Those peas are thawed.

131
00:08:47,185 --> 00:08:49,792
- This right here is
what it gets you.
- Mm-hmm.

132
00:08:49,792 --> 00:08:51,629
So I've hatched a plan,
my friend.

133
00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:52,960
If you'll come help me

134
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,258
move my shit
out of Sukie's tomorrow...

135
00:08:54,258 --> 00:08:55,666
I'm not getting
in the middle of that.

136
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,129
I have my own problems.

137
00:08:57,129 --> 00:08:58,999
What problems?

138
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:00,495
Internal.

139
00:09:00,495 --> 00:09:02,068
- Internal?
- Yes.

140
00:09:02,068 --> 00:09:03,773
I don't know
how else to put it.

141
00:09:03,773 --> 00:09:06,039
Problems with
what I feel internally.

142
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,942
How can you have
internal problems?

143
00:09:07,942 --> 00:09:09,944
You got your ass all bricked up.

144
00:09:09,944 --> 00:09:13,112
I'm not certain, honey darling,
that you have ever

145
00:09:13,112 --> 00:09:17,149
reached deep inside any orifice
to scoop out your soul

146
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:19,954
and fling it shamelessly
at a fellow human being

147
00:09:19,954 --> 00:09:23,155
and humiliate yourself
and grovel and weep

148
00:09:23,155 --> 00:09:25,894
and feel your ego
completely disintegrate,

149
00:09:25,894 --> 00:09:28,028
otherwise known as
the glory of love.

150
00:09:28,028 --> 00:09:29,766
Please don't eat those peas.

151
00:09:29,766 --> 00:09:32,362
Now, my plan is:
you come help me pack,

152
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:34,969
- and then we two...
- I can't. I'm leaving town.

153
00:09:34,969 --> 00:09:36,674
What? I am, too.
That was my plan.

154
00:09:36,674 --> 00:09:37,741
Where are you going?

155
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:39,336
Tallahassee, Florida.

156
00:09:39,336 --> 00:09:41,646
Why would anybody go
to Tallahassee, Florida?

157
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:43,307
My Aunt Ellis lives there.

158
00:09:43,307 --> 00:09:44,946
Can't she move?

159
00:09:44,946 --> 00:09:47,014
Tallahassee is very nice.

160
00:09:47,014 --> 00:09:49,016
It's not glitzy and gross
like Miami.

161
00:09:49,016 --> 00:09:50,545
It has live oak
and Spanish moss.

162
00:09:50,545 --> 00:09:53,790
Me and Aunt Ellis go to
the St. Marks Wildlife Preserve.

163
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,023
There's good birding.

164
00:09:56,023 --> 00:09:57,695
Birding?

165
00:09:57,695 --> 00:09:59,422
How have I missed out on this?

166
00:09:59,422 --> 00:10:01,028
It's very pleasant.

167
00:10:01,028 --> 00:10:04,031
So you just came up with this
wild hair in your ass to bird.

168
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:06,132
I've been unhappy,

169
00:10:06,132 --> 00:10:08,365
and I'm starting to snap
at people at work,

170
00:10:08,365 --> 00:10:09,806
and it's not fair to them.

171
00:10:09,806 --> 00:10:12,600
I'm only impatient with myself.

172
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,305
Well, we can fix that.

173
00:10:14,305 --> 00:10:16,142
We'll have you running right
in no time.

174
00:10:16,142 --> 00:10:18,177
That's why we take
this trip together, honey babe.

175
00:10:18,177 --> 00:10:21,015
We get our shit together, together.

176
00:10:21,015 --> 00:10:22,786
See, I was gonna take
some time off,

177
00:10:22,786 --> 00:10:25,316
get a drive-away,
just go potluck anywhere.

178
00:10:25,316 --> 00:10:26,691
Now you can come with me,

179
00:10:26,691 --> 00:10:28,693
and we can go to Tallahassee
and bird.

180
00:10:28,693 --> 00:10:30,354
What's a drive-away?

181
00:10:30,354 --> 00:10:31,696
Free one-way rental.

182
00:10:31,696 --> 00:10:33,698
You deliver the car
to wherever some client

183
00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:35,029
of the drive-away company
wants it,

184
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:37,130
if they got one going
near your destination.

185
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,836
I don't know
if you'll like Aunt Ellis.

186
00:10:39,836 --> 00:10:42,201
Are you kidding? A birder?

187
00:10:42,201 --> 00:10:45,204
I'll wear
my great big old straw hat,

188
00:10:45,204 --> 00:10:48,174
and she is going to
L-O-V-E love me.

189
00:10:48,174 --> 00:10:50,011
You know how
parents and such love me.

190
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:51,782
They think I got charisma.

191
00:10:51,782 --> 00:10:54,213
"Oh, Marian,
who's your loquacious friend?

192
00:10:54,213 --> 00:10:55,720
"I just love that
chatty little girl.

193
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,787
Isn't she something?"

194
00:10:56,787 --> 00:10:58,217
I'm not sure.

195
00:10:58,217 --> 00:10:59,757
Don't go finding a problem here.

196
00:10:59,757 --> 00:11:01,583
This is going to be
F-U-N-N fun, girl.

197
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,091
Just come help me move my stuff
out of Sukie's tomorrow.

198
00:11:04,091 --> 00:11:06,654
Don't worry,
she's not even gonna be there.

199
00:11:06,654 --> 00:11:08,161
<i>Oh, God!</i>

200
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:09,833
Take it! Oh, God!

201
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,066
Sukie, don't.
What are you doing?

202
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:14,431
I don't want it anymore.

203
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:16,433
You said
she wouldn't be here.

204
00:11:16,433 --> 00:11:19,876
Sukie, I'm just taking
my own stuff.

205
00:11:19,876 --> 00:11:21,405
That was a gift.

206
00:11:21,405 --> 00:11:22,978
I wanted you to have it.

207
00:11:22,978 --> 00:11:27,543
I don't want it if we're not
going to both use it!

208
00:11:27,543 --> 00:11:29,919
Sukie, it's your wall dildo.

209
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,481
No, no, no, no.

210
00:11:31,481 --> 00:11:33,252
And take Alice, too.

211
00:11:33,252 --> 00:11:34,924
I never liked her.

212
00:11:34,924 --> 00:11:36,618
And she won't stop barking!

213
00:11:36,618 --> 00:11:39,060
How can I take the dog, Sukie?
I don't have a home.

214
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,556
Remember, you kicked me out?

215
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:44,593
Take Alice. Take the wall dildo.

216
00:11:44,593 --> 00:11:46,738
It's your dildo,
Susanne.

217
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,138
Curlie's Drive-Away,

218
00:11:51,138 --> 00:11:53,206
Pennsylvania's most trusted
name in car delivery.

219
00:11:53,206 --> 00:11:54,570
Curlie speaking.

220
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,912
<i>Okay,
it's going to Tallahassee.</i>

221
00:11:55,912 --> 00:11:57,639
Uh-huh. Tallahassee, Florida.

222
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,509
<i>Yeah, you have something
to write this down?</i>

223
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:02,710
Yes, I'm writing it down.
<i>- To 14 Tinywick Road.</i>

224
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,788
Right.
<i>- Tallahassee.</i>

225
00:12:03,788 --> 00:12:04,954
Sure.
<i>- You got it?</i>

226
00:12:04,954 --> 00:12:06,582
- Right. Got it.
- Can you help us?

227
00:12:06,582 --> 00:12:08,892
<i>And it's got to be there
by end of day tomorrow.</i>

228
00:12:08,892 --> 00:12:10,685
By tomorrow.
<i>- No later.</i>

229
00:12:10,685 --> 00:12:12,192
Uh-huh.
<i>- Okay.</i>

230
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:14,293
Okay.
<i>- Over and out.</i>

231
00:12:15,395 --> 00:12:18,198
Can you help us?
We need a drive-away.

232
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:21,267
$250 deposit and a reference.

233
00:12:21,267 --> 00:12:22,664
A reference?

234
00:12:22,664 --> 00:12:24,501
Somebody local
I can break his balls

235
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:26,701
if you don't show up
where you're supposed to.

236
00:12:26,701 --> 00:12:28,406
His balls.

237
00:12:28,406 --> 00:12:31,244
Can the reference
be a woman?
We don't know a lot of men.

238
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,444
No kidding.

239
00:12:33,444 --> 00:12:36,117
- Where do you want to go?
- Tallahassee.

240
00:12:37,582 --> 00:12:39,087
Tallahassee?

241
00:12:39,087 --> 00:12:41,386
What's wrong with Tallahassee?
It's very nice.

242
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,058
There's Spanish moss
and live oak.

243
00:12:43,058 --> 00:12:44,191
I think Curlie here...

244
00:12:44,191 --> 00:12:45,929
Don't call me Curlie.

245
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,866
Isn't your name Curlie?

246
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:50,032
My name is Curlie.

247
00:12:50,032 --> 00:12:51,836
We just met. It's too familiar.

248
00:12:51,836 --> 00:12:53,904
Have you ever been
to Tallahassee?

249
00:12:53,904 --> 00:12:55,202
No, I got good sense.

250
00:12:55,202 --> 00:12:57,974
- Your car is a Dodge Aries.
- Oh.

251
00:12:57,974 --> 00:13:00,504
Okay. Is that a good car?

252
00:13:00,504 --> 00:13:02,077
Not really.

253
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,707
You sell those shirts?

254
00:13:05,707 --> 00:13:07,742
There's also a place
here in Wilmington--

255
00:13:07,742 --> 00:13:09,711
fantastic dyke bar,
the Butter Churn.

256
00:13:09,711 --> 00:13:11,922
And this place,
Levi's Barbecue in Charleston.

257
00:13:11,922 --> 00:13:13,781
Memphis-style barbecue,
really good.

258
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:14,991
Everyone goes
to Charlie Vergos',

259
00:13:14,991 --> 00:13:16,289
- but it's just...
- Jamie.

260
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:17,455
It's a straight shot
to Tallahassee.

261
00:13:17,455 --> 00:13:18,720
Down and across.

262
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,227
Right here's the world's
largest Dixie cup

263
00:13:20,227 --> 00:13:21,789
outside of Mitchell, Georgia.

264
00:13:21,789 --> 00:13:23,527
Direct route, down and across.

265
00:13:23,527 --> 00:13:26,200
We don't need to see
the world's largest Dixie cup.

266
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,005
We don't need to enjoy life,
but as long as we're here...

267
00:13:29,005 --> 00:13:31,370
The world's largest Dixie cup
is not life.

268
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,878
It's a straight shot on
the interstate, down and across.

269
00:13:33,878 --> 00:13:35,308
The interstate is not life.

270
00:13:35,308 --> 00:13:37,244
It is, more than
the world's largest Dixie cup.

271
00:13:37,244 --> 00:13:39,180
You're the one
that wanted to go birding.
That's nature.

272
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,544
What's a dyke bar?
That's not nature?

273
00:13:40,544 --> 00:13:42,546
Even a Dixie cup,
you could make an argument.

274
00:13:42,546 --> 00:13:44,020
He said it was a rush job.

275
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,153
We're supposed to have
the car there tomorrow.

276
00:13:45,153 --> 00:13:46,517
Tomorrow can wait a day.

277
00:13:46,517 --> 00:13:48,024
We could even go to Miami.

278
00:13:48,024 --> 00:13:49,289
Bikinis and high heels.

279
00:13:51,357 --> 00:13:53,029
A medical doctor?

280
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:54,624
Or a reverend?

281
00:13:54,624 --> 00:13:58,793
Yeah, no, we don't have
a discount for men of God, no.

282
00:13:58,793 --> 00:14:00,971
No, not for medical doctors, either.

283
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:02,665
Make up your mind--
which are you?

284
00:14:02,665 --> 00:14:05,470
It doesn't matter.
We have no discounts.

285
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,913
Our everyday low prices
are already rock bottom.

286
00:14:08,913 --> 00:14:11,278
Thank you for calling Curlie's.

287
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,919
Welcome to Curlie's Drive-Away.

288
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:18,483
Well, we're here.

289
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,024
Okay. Who are you?

290
00:14:21,851 --> 00:14:24,654
- The car.
- The car?

291
00:14:24,654 --> 00:14:26,326
The Dodge Aries.

292
00:14:26,856 --> 00:14:28,592
The Dodge Aries?

293
00:14:28,592 --> 00:14:29,934
What are you, a mynah bird?

294
00:14:29,934 --> 00:14:31,100
I'm Curlie.

295
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,970
I understand that.

296
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,631
You're not the Dodge.

297
00:14:35,502 --> 00:14:38,701
What do you mean,
we're not the Dodge?

298
00:14:48,515 --> 00:14:50,713
What's the big deal?
The car isn't ours.

299
00:14:50,713 --> 00:14:53,254
But it's art, and the car
is ours till Tallahassee.

300
00:14:53,254 --> 00:14:56,488
And once we get to Tallahassee,
it stops being art
and starts being vandalism.

301
00:14:56,488 --> 00:14:58,688
Fuckety-fuck's sake, Marian,
it'll come off with a little

302
00:14:58,688 --> 00:15:00,327
- soap and water.
- It won't.

303
00:15:00,327 --> 00:15:02,296
- Won't what?
- Come off with soap and water.

304
00:15:02,296 --> 00:15:04,760
- Well, how do you know?
- I tried.

305
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,828
Marian, it's art.

306
00:15:06,828 --> 00:15:08,170
Stop saying it's art.

307
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,831
That doesn't end all discussion.

308
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:11,041
We're gonna be driving through

309
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,109
some conservative towns--
the South.

310
00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:14,902
- The Bible Belt.
- Mm, don't I know it.

311
00:15:14,902 --> 00:15:16,871
Honey, I grew up
where the Bible Belt

312
00:15:16,871 --> 00:15:18,642
meets the ass crack
of the Pecos River.

313
00:15:18,642 --> 00:15:20,908
Fort Worth is nowhere near
the "Pay-cos" River.

314
00:15:20,908 --> 00:15:23,350
That's "Peck-us,"
honey darling.

315
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,957
And the car art is just a part
of my larger undertaking.

316
00:15:25,957 --> 00:15:27,189
My project.

317
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:29,224
What's your project?

318
00:15:29,224 --> 00:15:32,931
Loosening you up so we can
get you laid, sugar sweet.

319
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,329
How long's it been?

320
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:39,102
Weeks?

321
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,303
Months?

322
00:15:43,603 --> 00:15:44,569
Oh, my God, Marian.

323
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,934
Don't tell me it's been years.

324
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:48,870
H-How many years? Who was it?

325
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,213
You've had sex since
what's-her-name, haven't you?

326
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:52,808
Donna.

327
00:15:52,808 --> 00:15:54,315
Yeah, Donna.

328
00:15:57,419 --> 00:15:59,056
Oh, my God.

329
00:15:59,553 --> 00:16:01,718
Oh, my God. Donna?

330
00:16:02,622 --> 00:16:04,886
She work for Al Gore now?

331
00:16:04,886 --> 00:16:06,261
Nader.

332
00:16:06,261 --> 00:16:08,593
That's right.
She just looks like Al Gore.

333
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,332
Wait a minute.

334
00:16:12,236 --> 00:16:15,270
You said people of yours
would come in for it.

335
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:18,933
Yes, I did.

336
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:22,277
You call with a drop-off
in Tallahassee,

337
00:16:22,277 --> 00:16:23,773
and then these broads come in

338
00:16:23,773 --> 00:16:26,248
and say they're ready
to go to Tallahassee.

339
00:16:26,248 --> 00:16:28,283
You gave them the car.

340
00:16:28,283 --> 00:16:30,087
You don't know who they were?

341
00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:31,781
I told you their names.

342
00:16:31,781 --> 00:16:33,222
Their names, yes, but...

343
00:16:33,222 --> 00:16:35,059
This place is a dump.

344
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:37,160
They drive the car
instead of you.

345
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,326
Is that bad?

346
00:16:38,326 --> 00:16:39,888
Bad if they find the goods.

347
00:16:39,888 --> 00:16:42,363
This place is a pigsty.
Why don't you get a girl in?

348
00:16:42,363 --> 00:16:43,958
I like clutter.

349
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,300
They didn't have
a cellular phone?

350
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,532
Sterile doesn't work for me.

351
00:16:46,532 --> 00:16:48,204
He asked you a question,
dick-yank.

352
00:16:48,204 --> 00:16:49,766
- Dick-yank?
- Flint.

353
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:50,998
I'm a dick-yank?

354
00:16:50,998 --> 00:16:52,406
Don't antagonize.

355
00:16:52,406 --> 00:16:54,001
It's like talking
to a bucket of wet cement.

356
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:55,937
You wouldn't know wet cement
if it bit you in the ass.

357
00:16:55,937 --> 00:16:57,543
And you would?

358
00:16:57,543 --> 00:16:59,908
So, there's no way
to get in contact with them?

359
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,779
Not per se.

360
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:04,253
"Per se"?!

361
00:17:04,253 --> 00:17:06,717
They left a local number.

362
00:17:06,717 --> 00:17:09,852
Everybody's got to leave
a local number.

363
00:17:09,852 --> 00:17:11,623
Someone whose balls I can break.

364
00:17:15,858 --> 00:17:18,036
Now you've gone and done it.

365
00:17:22,073 --> 00:17:26,000
Susanne Shinkleman,
2431 North Garnet.

366
00:17:28,805 --> 00:17:31,511
You better hope your friends
deliver that car.

367
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,283
Tomorrow.

368
00:17:37,453 --> 00:17:39,189
This is great.

369
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:41,554
This is so slutty.
I love this.

370
00:17:41,554 --> 00:17:44,260
- Hope they have postcards.
- Uh, Jamie?

371
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,163
All right,
let's put on our war paint.

372
00:17:46,163 --> 00:17:47,362
The Butter Churn awaits.

373
00:17:47,362 --> 00:17:48,759
Jamie,
I think I'd prefer to...

374
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:50,728
No. No, don't even.

375
00:17:50,728 --> 00:17:51,993
You come with me.

376
00:17:51,993 --> 00:17:53,764
I'll show you how this is done.

377
00:18:02,445 --> 00:18:04,709
Hiya. Do you know
where the Butter Churn is?

378
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,315
It's a dyke bar.

379
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,549
Or do you have, like,
a <i>Time Out Wilmington?</i>

380
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:12,486
I mean, is there one with,
uh, gay/lesbian listings?

381
00:18:12,486 --> 00:18:14,488
You wouldn't have one,
but do you know

382
00:18:14,488 --> 00:18:17,623
if there's a newsstand
or a lesbian bookstore?

383
00:18:17,623 --> 00:18:20,626
You know, Sapphic Wonders,
something like that?

384
00:18:24,731 --> 00:18:26,302
Hello?

385
00:18:31,835 --> 00:18:33,507
Confidence.

386
00:18:33,507 --> 00:18:36,070
You got to show that you're
comfortable with the physical.

387
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,446
This isn't like meeting somebody
at a NOW convention,

388
00:18:38,446 --> 00:18:40,415
where you talk about
dismantling the patriarchy.

389
00:18:40,415 --> 00:18:42,153
Jamie, I have done this before.

390
00:18:42,153 --> 00:18:43,748
It's just like this.

391
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,255
One message.

392
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:47,818
You dig the female body.

393
00:18:47,818 --> 00:18:49,160
Your body.

394
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,195
You're like this.

395
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:53,989
Not like this.

396
00:18:54,761 --> 00:18:57,058
"Let's dismantle
the patriarchy."

397
00:18:57,058 --> 00:18:58,125
I have done this before.

398
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,533
I am not a schoolmarm.

399
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:01,095
You fuck people
that work for Ralph Nader.

400
00:19:01,095 --> 00:19:03,031
- Not only.
- Only in the last four years.

401
00:19:03,031 --> 00:19:04,736
Three years.

402
00:19:06,102 --> 00:19:07,574
And four months and 14 days.

403
00:19:09,609 --> 00:19:12,480
<i>♪ Peanut, peanut butter ♪</i>

404
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,042
Okay.

405

but it stuck to my teeth... ♪</i>

406

407
00:19:17,045 --> 00:19:18,882
Very much so.

408
00:19:18,882 --> 00:19:20,488
Okay.

409
00:19:21,887 --> 00:19:23,458
Who looks good to you?

410
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,758
<i>♪ Peanut, peanut butter... ♪</i>

411
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:28,265
They all look fine.

412
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:30,366
Fine?

413
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:31,664
Like, "You'll do"?

414
00:19:31,664 --> 00:19:33,534
"Please, please
come home with me, baby.

415
00:19:33,534 --> 00:19:34,997
"You seem totally okay.

416
00:19:34,997 --> 00:19:36,702
Are there any other mediocre
ones like you at home?"

417
00:19:36,702 --> 00:19:38,341
I didn't say
they all looked mediocre.

418
00:19:38,341 --> 00:19:39,705
I said they all looked fine.

419
00:19:39,705 --> 00:19:42,477
Yeah, but not in
the sense of "super fine."

420
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:45,315
In the sense of
"fine, whatever."

421
00:19:45,315 --> 00:19:47,218
Why are you jousting with me?

422
00:19:48,111 --> 00:19:49,616
I'm not jousting.

423
00:19:49,616 --> 00:19:50,848
I'm asking which of these women

424
00:19:50,848 --> 00:19:52,586
you want to throw up
against the wall

425
00:19:52,586 --> 00:19:54,148
and fuck like
there's no tomorrow.

426
00:19:54,148 --> 00:19:56,392
Look, Jamie, I'm not a
"throw up against the wall

427
00:19:56,392 --> 00:19:58,262
and fuck the daylights out of"
kind of person.

428
00:19:58,262 --> 00:19:59,758
Stop trying to make me
something I'm not.

429
00:19:59,758 --> 00:20:02,024
I'm just trying to
get you laid, sugar sweet.

430
00:20:02,024 --> 00:20:03,190
They sense it,

431
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,532
whether you want to fuck them

432
00:20:04,532 --> 00:20:05,995
or you think they're just fine.

433
00:20:05,995 --> 00:20:07,469
I have to be me.

434
00:20:07,469 --> 00:20:09,504
It has to be done
with authenticity.

435
00:20:09,504 --> 00:20:11,506
- You mean with authority.
- I mean with authenticity.

436
00:20:11,506 --> 00:20:14,201
Authenticity gets you somebody
that works for Ralph Nader.

437
00:20:14,201 --> 00:20:15,708
You don't know
what our life was like.

438
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,446
You know nothing
about its worth.

439
00:20:17,446 --> 00:20:18,876
Then why didn't
the two of you move

440
00:20:18,876 --> 00:20:20,878
to Santa Fe and synchronize
your menstrual cycles?

441
00:20:20,878 --> 00:20:22,044
That didn't happen.

442
00:20:22,044 --> 00:20:24,145
That's why you're here
in a dyke bar

443
00:20:24,145 --> 00:20:25,487
looking for cheap, sleazy sex.

444
00:20:25,487 --> 00:20:26,884
No, I'm not.

445
00:20:27,821 --> 00:20:28,820
This is not me.

446
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,953
You're right.
I can't do this.

447
00:20:29,953 --> 00:20:31,856
No, Marian.

448
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:35,728
I'm sorry, honey girl.
I-I'm saying you can do this.

449
00:20:35,728 --> 00:20:37,334
You can do this.

450
00:20:37,334 --> 00:20:39,270
You can be cheap.
I promise, honey girl.

451
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,568
Your best self.

452
00:20:40,568 --> 00:20:41,833
Jamie, I know
you're well-intentioned,

453
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,538
but this really isn't
right for me.

454
00:20:43,538 --> 00:20:46,475
You should stay and enjoy
your night on the town.

00:21:26,649 --> 00:21:29,210

Hello.

473
00:21:39,255 --> 00:21:42,828

No.

No, no.

- Oh. Okay.

477

481

483
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:35,842
Good.

484

repressed in New England.

487
00:23:43,817 --> 00:23:46,380
That is why we are going
the other way.

488
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,788
Although there was
this one chick

489
00:23:47,788 --> 00:23:49,460
I screwed once
from New Hampshire.

490
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,121
Uh, she got her tongue
so far in me,

491
00:23:51,121 --> 00:23:53,288
I swore it was gonna
wriggle out my asshole.

492
00:23:53,288 --> 00:23:54,861
No, I'm not kidding.

493
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:56,764
They say that there's
advanced yoga people

494
00:23:56,764 --> 00:23:58,502
in India supposedly
who can do that.

495
00:23:58,502 --> 00:24:00,504
Black belts in cunnilingus.

496
00:24:00,504 --> 00:24:02,869
They can even
cunniling themselves.

497
00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:05,168
They got pictures of it
in, like, medical texts.

498
00:24:05,168 --> 00:24:06,477
You got to ask the librarian.

499
00:24:06,477 --> 00:24:08,435
They don't keep 'em
in the stacks.

500
00:24:08,435 --> 00:24:10,074
Who wrote your book?

501
00:24:11,011 --> 00:24:13,616
Henry James...

502
00:24:13,616 --> 00:24:15,849
American writer.

503
00:24:15,849 --> 00:24:18,016
Famous family. His brother, too.

504
00:24:18,016 --> 00:24:19,083
Rick?

505
00:24:20,053 --> 00:24:21,558
No, I'm kidding.

506
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:23,417
I know who Henry James is.

507
00:24:23,417 --> 00:24:24,957
White and uptight.

508
00:24:25,861 --> 00:24:29,258
They had us read
<i>Portrait of a Lady</i> in school.

509
00:24:29,258 --> 00:24:31,128
Boy, that was a great read.

510
00:24:31,128 --> 00:24:34,131
Like somebody dragging day-old
spaghetti across my tits.

511
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:36,936
That's a very apt simile.

512
00:24:36,936 --> 00:24:39,609
- His prose is labyrinthine.
- Yeah.

513
00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:42,040
Put me off the whole book thing.

514
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,273
Henry James is, in fact,
the reason that I don't read.

515
00:24:44,273 --> 00:24:46,341
- Uh-huh.
- Except road signs.

516
00:24:46,341 --> 00:24:48,552
Uh-huh, yeah. I don't think
you should've brought
someone back to the room.

517
00:24:49,984 --> 00:24:51,445
Okay.

518
00:24:51,445 --> 00:24:52,787
I knew this was coming.

519
00:24:52,787 --> 00:24:54,525
How do you think I felt?

520
00:24:54,525 --> 00:24:56,120
You told me to have
a night on the town.

521
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,353
Yeah, people say things.
It's not always what they feel.

522
00:24:58,353 --> 00:25:00,663
Yeah, well, I'm from Texas.
We don't read minds.

523
00:25:00,663 --> 00:25:02,027
We operate on
a handshake basis.

524
00:25:02,027 --> 00:25:03,897
- What does that mean?
-"Hiya. How you doing?

525
00:25:03,897 --> 00:25:05,261
"How much for that Cadillac car?

526
00:25:05,261 --> 00:25:07,296
How would you like to have
oral sex?" Texas!

527
00:25:07,296 --> 00:25:08,902
- Okay.
- Where you from, girl?

528
00:25:08,902 --> 00:25:10,134
- Not Texas.
- I know that.

529
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,433
- Well, then why'd you ask?
- I...

No. I'm sorry.

00:25:32,794 --> 00:25:33,960
Why are you sorry?

539
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,457
You're good. I'm a little...

540
00:25:36,457 --> 00:25:37,832
No, I'm a big baby sometimes.

541
00:25:37,832 --> 00:25:40,802
Uncle Gino's!

542
00:25:41,904 --> 00:25:44,542
You are not going
to believe this.

543
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,270
See over there?

544
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,678
UNG soccer team.

545
00:25:48,678 --> 00:25:49,976
Uh-huh.

546
00:25:49,976 --> 00:25:52,110
I was in line next to Doreen,
the captain.

547
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,243
Uh-huh.

548
00:25:53,243 --> 00:25:54,915
They're very committed lesbians,

549
00:25:54,915 --> 00:25:56,081
and they're on their way
to Marietta, Georgia,

550
00:25:56,081 --> 00:25:57,720
which is practically on our way.

551
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,018
Not exactly.

552
00:25:59,018 --> 00:26:00,723
We were supposed to deliver
the car today.

553
00:26:00,723 --> 00:26:02,087
Should we look at the map,
see how long...

554
00:26:02,087 --> 00:26:04,155
Forget the map.
After today's game,

555
00:26:04,155 --> 00:26:06,421
these girls are gonna have
a basement party.

556
00:26:06,421 --> 00:26:07,763
And guess who's invited.

557
00:26:07,763 --> 00:26:09,193
I'm sure you are.

558
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:10,260
Nuh-uh.

559
00:26:11,461 --> 00:26:13,065
Us.

560
00:26:13,065 --> 00:26:14,231
You see?

561
00:26:14,231 --> 00:26:16,706
Shit happens when
you eat at Uncle Gino's.

562
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,237
Goal! Goal!

563
00:27:02,578 --> 00:27:04,116
Hello?

564
00:27:04,116 --> 00:27:05,986
<i>Well,
here I am, my thumb up my ass.</i>

565
00:27:05,986 --> 00:27:08,417
- They didn't.
- <i>No.</i>

566
00:27:08,417 --> 00:27:10,694
That's all right.

- Yes, sir.

Should've known
it was about that cunt!

You-you shouldn't do that.

And where's that?

648
00:32:31,311 --> 00:32:33,181
Some motel. I don't know.

649
00:32:33,181 --> 00:32:35,117
You don't know?

650
00:32:35,117 --> 00:32:37,086
I can't remember the name.

651
00:32:37,086 --> 00:32:39,088
A motel on the highway.

652
00:32:39,088 --> 00:32:40,650
And where you coming from?

653
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:41,915
A house.

654
00:32:41,915 --> 00:32:43,521
Whose house?

655
00:32:43,521 --> 00:32:44,720
I don't know.

656
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,392
It was a slumber party.

657
00:32:47,461 --> 00:32:50,330
Little old for slumber parties,
aren't you, miss?

658
00:32:51,168 --> 00:32:54,004
Look, mister...

659
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,618
You know what?

660
00:33:16,556 --> 00:33:18,787
I'm gonna drop you off at home.

661
00:33:18,787 --> 00:33:20,954

<i>Hey, handsome.</i>

676
00:36:26,449 --> 00:36:28,042
Hey, handsome.

677
00:36:28,042 --> 00:36:30,143
Want to get plastered?

678
00:36:33,819 --> 00:36:35,522
I'll drive
when it's my turn.

679
00:36:35,522 --> 00:36:37,524
At the end of three hours.

680
00:36:37,524 --> 00:36:39,625
I have no sympathy for you,
my friend.

681
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:41,792
You could've just asked her,
and you'd be fine right now.

682
00:36:41,792 --> 00:36:44,366
I just asked. She answered.

683
00:36:44,366 --> 00:36:45,928
But you cannot relate
to the public,

684
00:36:45,928 --> 00:36:48,238
which, in a service profession,
is a big fucking handicap.

685
00:36:48,238 --> 00:36:49,602
And that sound

686
00:36:49,602 --> 00:36:51,241
is beginning to get irritating.

687
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:52,737
Well, your lectures
are getting irritating.

688
00:36:52,737 --> 00:36:55,245
I don't lecture, my friend.
That's my point.

689
00:36:55,245 --> 00:36:57,379
I take people in. I react.

690
00:36:57,379 --> 00:36:59,546
I read people
to get what I want.

691
00:36:59,546 --> 00:37:01,614
You, though,
you think life is this

692
00:37:01,614 --> 00:37:03,781
orderly series of people
to beat the shit out of.

693
00:37:03,781 --> 00:37:06,014
Well, real life
is not like that.

694
00:37:06,014 --> 00:37:08,423
You only see it that way
because you're not nourished

695
00:37:08,423 --> 00:37:11,591
by human contact, the human
give-and-take, so forth.

696
00:37:11,591 --> 00:37:13,593
Uh-uh. "Me want, me take."

697
00:37:13,593 --> 00:37:15,023
That's what you're
comfortable with.

698
00:37:15,023 --> 00:37:16,530
- Yeah, yeah.
- Caveman shit.

699
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,894
You don't engage
the whole person.

700
00:37:17,894 --> 00:37:20,028
Well, you did a great job
helping me engage

701
00:37:20,028 --> 00:37:23,229
that very agile harpy.

702
00:37:23,229 --> 00:37:24,769
Didn't have to.

703
00:37:24,769 --> 00:37:26,870
No need whatsoever
for the physical approach,

704
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,169
which you couldn't see
because you don't savor

705
00:37:29,169 --> 00:37:30,676
the stuff of life.

706
00:37:30,676 --> 00:37:32,381
I'm not a sissy boy,
if that's what you mean.

707
00:37:32,381 --> 00:37:34,614
Kiss my ass. I...

708
00:37:35,914 --> 00:37:38,387
- Hello?
<i>- Okay, we're on track.</i>

709
00:37:38,387 --> 00:37:40,389
<i>Marian Pallavi was picked up
for vagrancy</i>

710
00:37:40,389 --> 00:37:42,754
<i>last night in Marietta, Georgi.</i>

711
00:37:42,754 --> 00:37:44,888
<i>- Just north of Atlanta.</i>
- On it.

712
00:37:45,957 --> 00:37:47,528
Georgia.

713
00:38:00,477 --> 00:38:01,707
Thank you.

714
00:38:02,743 --> 00:38:03,775
For what?

715
00:38:04,514 --> 00:38:06,613
Just picking me up.

716
00:38:06,613 --> 00:38:08,450
Am I not gonna pick you up?

717
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,276
Hard not to.

718
00:38:10,276 --> 00:38:12,586
"Ma'am, your friend here
is in the hoosegow.
Care to come get her?"

719
00:38:12,586 --> 00:38:14,390
I'll come get you
all day, every day.

720
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:16,282
I will not let a friend of mine
rot in prison

721
00:38:16,282 --> 00:38:18,493
longer than is
absolutely necessary.

722
00:38:18,493 --> 00:38:21,628
And so I say thank you.

723
00:38:26,866 --> 00:38:29,636
Course, you ain't told me
how you come to be in prison,

724
00:38:29,636 --> 00:38:32,232
and I've been careful
not to ask,

725
00:38:32,232 --> 00:38:34,707
but damn, Marian,

726
00:38:34,707 --> 00:38:38,238
landing yourself in prison is
a very hopeful sign for you.

727
00:38:38,238 --> 00:38:40,240
I think it was jail,
not prison.

728
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,780
Oh. I'm sorry.

729
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,178
Uh, you ain't told me
how you come to be in jail.

730
00:38:44,178 --> 00:38:45,982
It wasn't hell-raising.

731
00:38:45,982 --> 00:38:47,753
Sorry to disappoint.

732
00:38:47,753 --> 00:38:50,624
A policeman didn't like my tone.

733
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,922
Oh.

734
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,595
You copped some attitude.

735
00:38:55,224 --> 00:38:56,861
I don't have attitude.

736
00:38:58,535 --> 00:39:00,469
Marian, if I may,

737
00:39:00,469 --> 00:39:02,735
there are certain things in life

738
00:39:02,735 --> 00:39:05,540
which you got to sense
and understand

739
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,674
in order to live life,

740
00:39:07,674 --> 00:39:10,710
and one of the things that
you got to understand is, uh...

741
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:13,042
well, all these
funny little creatures

742
00:39:13,042 --> 00:39:15,517
that you probably noticed
walking around on two legs,

743
00:39:15,517 --> 00:39:17,079
we call 'em human beings.

744
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:19,884
Got to understand
what makes 'em tick.

745
00:39:19,884 --> 00:39:22,425
And your whole social situation,

746
00:39:22,425 --> 00:39:23,888
you got to understand
what that is.

747
00:39:23,888 --> 00:39:24,790
Uh-huh.

748
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,220
You know what that means?

749
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,562
"Social situation"?

750
00:39:27,562 --> 00:39:29,465
I know what
"social situation" means.

751
00:39:29,465 --> 00:39:30,664
Okay, good.

752
00:39:30,664 --> 00:39:32,633
So, the whole thing
with a cop is--

753
00:39:32,633 --> 00:39:34,899
and you should remember this
for future reference--

754
00:39:34,899 --> 00:39:38,364
when you're in
a social situation with a cop,

755
00:39:38,364 --> 00:39:40,267
there ain't no social situation.

756
00:39:40,267 --> 00:39:43,204
There's a "keep your fucking
mouth shut" situation.

757
00:39:43,204 --> 00:39:45,272
There's a "yes, sir" situation
is what there is.

758
00:39:45,272 --> 00:39:47,340
Believe me, honey doll,
I've been dating a cop

759
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,847
for two years now, and...

760
00:39:48,847 --> 00:39:50,552
I ain't talking through
my vulva here.

761
00:39:50,552 --> 00:39:52,950
Thank you. I understand.

762
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,117
But if authority
is being abused,

763
00:39:55,117 --> 00:39:57,724
- there's an obligation to...
- Holy shit.

764
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:00,760
Florida.

765
00:40:05,129 --> 00:40:06,733
Lesbian...

766
00:40:06,733 --> 00:40:11,540
don't let the sun
go down on you here.

767
00:40:31,626 --> 00:40:34,057
You okay?

768
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,993
Spare tire.

769
00:40:50,845 --> 00:40:52,013
What?

770
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,783
Something burning?

771
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:14,834
Jamie, it's cold.

772
00:41:17,366 --> 00:41:18,640
Don't touch it.

773
00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:21,940
I saw this movie once where

774
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,547
they come across this box,
the people in the movie,

775
00:41:24,547 --> 00:41:26,043
and they opened the box,

776
00:41:26,043 --> 00:41:29,849
and it was, like,
really, really bad.

777
00:41:44,492 --> 00:41:46,998
Head!

778
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:58,273
No, I'm kidding.

779
00:41:58,273 --> 00:42:01,045
It was a minor traffic accident.

780
00:42:01,045 --> 00:42:02,508
Fast stop.

781
00:42:02,508 --> 00:42:05,786
His, uh, face hit the wheel.

782
00:42:05,786 --> 00:42:07,953
Looking at a pretty girl,
weren't you, Flint?

783
00:42:09,724 --> 00:42:11,693
No more looking at
pretty girls for you, right?

784
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:14,960
That's right.

785
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,831
So, are they, like,
wanted or something?

786
00:42:17,831 --> 00:42:20,669
Oh, no, no. No, they're not
in trouble at all.

787
00:42:20,669 --> 00:42:22,495
Just drove off
with something we need.

788
00:42:22,495 --> 00:42:24,101
Didn't even know they had it.

789
00:42:24,101 --> 00:42:26,906
So, what were you all
doing here last night?

790
00:42:27,777 --> 00:42:30,305
Just making out.

791
00:42:30,305 --> 00:42:32,208
Oh, yeah?

792
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:33,715
With who?

793
00:42:35,915 --> 00:42:38,049
No kiss-and-tell, huh?

794
00:42:39,688 --> 00:42:42,119
Anyway, we need to find
those girls to get our...

795
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,990
sample case back.

796
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:47,795
And when we heard Doreen here
paid Marian's fine, we thought,

797
00:42:47,795 --> 00:42:49,390
well, you girls might know
where they're headed.

798
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:52,030
How did you know about
its being Doreen's check?

799
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:54,296
We have contacts
in law enforcement.

800
00:42:58,973 --> 00:43:00,500
No, no.

801
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,842
We should just call the cops.

802
00:43:01,842 --> 00:43:03,239
We will, Jamie.

803
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:06,473
First, we should see
what's in here.

804
00:43:06,473 --> 00:43:08,013
Why? I don't want to look.

805
00:43:08,013 --> 00:43:10,048
- Why do I have to look?
- Jamie, listen.

806
00:43:10,048 --> 00:43:12,479
Whoever sliced that head off
knows who we are.

807
00:43:12,479 --> 00:43:14,052
This might tell us
who they are,

808
00:43:14,052 --> 00:43:16,021
so we won't be
at a disadvantage.

809
00:43:16,021 --> 00:43:18,386
The police can find out,
and the police can protect us.

810
00:43:18,386 --> 00:43:20,190
Protect us?

811
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,522
They're not the Secret Service,
and we're not Chelsea Clinton.

812
00:43:22,522 --> 00:43:23,996
What do we lose by looking?

813
00:43:25,395 --> 00:43:26,900
Look.

814
00:43:27,804 --> 00:43:30,035
I just want to know
what's going on.

815
00:43:31,269 --> 00:43:33,038
This might tell us.

816
00:43:33,843 --> 00:43:35,139
I bet it's locked.

817
00:43:59,231 --> 00:44:01,869
- We got to call the cops.
- Why?

818
00:44:01,869 --> 00:44:03,233
That was awful.

819
00:44:03,233 --> 00:44:05,202
You just said
not to call the cops.

820
00:44:05,202 --> 00:44:06,808
In ignorance.

821
00:44:06,808 --> 00:44:08,205
No, what you said was true.

822
00:44:08,205 --> 00:44:09,976
The cops could think
you're involved.

823
00:44:09,976 --> 00:44:11,538
You just spent
the night in jail.

824
00:44:11,538 --> 00:44:12,979
For vagrancy.

825
00:44:12,979 --> 00:44:15,377
We wouldn't have anything
to do with... that.

826
00:44:15,377 --> 00:44:16,719
Okay, honey, cool your jets.

827
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:17,951
Here's what we do.

828
00:44:17,951 --> 00:44:19,953
First, we get to Tallahassee.

829
00:44:19,953 --> 00:44:21,383
Bye!

830
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:25,893
How about next time,
you let me do all the talking?

831
00:44:25,893 --> 00:44:27,422
Sure, gassing is
what you're good at.

832
00:44:27,422 --> 00:44:29,193
Well it sure as hell
ain't what you're good at.

833
00:44:29,193 --> 00:44:31,096
I'm not a suck-up or a salesman.

834
00:44:31,096 --> 00:44:32,361
Uh-huh.
You think you would've gotten

835
00:44:32,361 --> 00:44:33,868
the address
where they're headed?

836
00:44:33,868 --> 00:44:36,101
I don't think so, Mr. Sunshine.

837
00:44:36,101 --> 00:44:38,004
Okay, we've got
some hard driving to do.

838
00:44:38,004 --> 00:44:40,039
Bye!

839
00:44:44,144 --> 00:44:45,847
Welcome to El Conquistador.

840
00:44:45,847 --> 00:44:48,410
Yeah, hiya. Do you have a room
for two right away?

841
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:50,852
Uh, we do have one available.
Yes. How many nights?

842
00:44:50,852 --> 00:44:53,415
Well, tonight,
and then we'll play it by ear.

843
00:44:53,415 --> 00:44:54,823
You take the Rainbow Card?

844
00:44:54,823 --> 00:44:56,385
Uh, I'm sure we do.

845
00:44:56,385 --> 00:44:58,453
Yes, actually, that's just
a, uh, Visa specialty card.

846
00:44:58,453 --> 00:45:00,323
Yeah, but they give
a percentage of each purchase

847
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:02,424
to gay, lesbian, bi,
transgender charities.

848
00:45:02,424 --> 00:45:03,964
You do that, right?

849
00:45:03,964 --> 00:45:05,196
Well, the issuer would be
the one to take care of that.

850
00:45:05,196 --> 00:45:06,736
Do you have
a super reinforced safe

851
00:45:06,736 --> 00:45:08,331
for sensitive materials?

852
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:09,772
We do have in-room safes

853
00:45:09,772 --> 00:45:11,807
for any valuables
that you may have.

854
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:13,567
This place is
lesbian-friendly, right?

855
00:45:13,567 --> 00:45:15,371
Uh, yes. Uh, well, sure.

856
00:45:15,371 --> 00:45:17,274
We're friendly to anyone
who wants to stay.

857
00:45:17,274 --> 00:45:18,341
Do you have ice?

858
00:45:23,546 --> 00:45:27,581
<i>♪ I've been waitin' on you,
girl... ♪</i>

859
00:45:27,581 --> 00:45:29,286
This is it?

860
00:45:30,553 --> 00:45:32,223
They said Farm Road 80.

861
00:45:33,028 --> 00:45:34,764
What's the matter?

862
00:45:34,764 --> 00:45:36,931
Afraid of the stuff of life?

863
00:45:36,931 --> 00:45:40,264
<i>♪ Lovin' another guy ♪</i>

864
00:45:41,971 --> 00:45:45,973
<i>♪ Ooh, babe ♪</i>

865
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:49,042

866
00:45:51,673 --> 00:45:55,785

867
00:45:55,785 --> 00:45:58,744
<i>♪ I love you... ♪</i>

868
00:45:58,744 --> 00:46:02,055
Is this, um... Slappy's?

869
00:46:02,055 --> 00:46:03,991
That's right.

870
00:46:06,424 --> 00:46:10,723
Have you seen two, um,
nonlocal women come in here?

871
00:46:10,723 --> 00:46:12,164
That's one of them.

872
00:46:14,168 --> 00:46:15,398
I was sittin' here listening

873
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:17,103
to Junior Kimbrough
a couple years back.

874
00:46:17,103 --> 00:46:20,370
One girl come in here,
appear to be to me a half local.

875
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:23,472
I don't recollect two
come in here any time recent.

876
00:46:26,708 --> 00:46:28,576
Now, that's true.

877
00:46:28,576 --> 00:46:30,479
Love will bite your ass.

878
00:46:33,748 --> 00:46:37,618
<i>♪ Ooh, babe ♪</i>

879
00:46:37,618 --> 00:46:39,994
<i>♪ I love you. ♪</i>

880
00:46:41,228 --> 00:46:43,096
Oh, I can send Sukie.

881
00:46:43,096 --> 00:46:45,131
But why would these people
just be waiting there

882
00:46:45,131 --> 00:46:46,594
in the drive-away office?

883
00:46:46,594 --> 00:46:47,870
Well, clearly, this was not

884
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:49,498
your garden-variety
decapitation.

885
00:46:49,498 --> 00:46:51,005
This was some kind of a...

886
00:46:51,005 --> 00:46:52,941
Well, I don't know what it was,

887
00:46:52,941 --> 00:46:55,603
but they know
we have their stuff.

888
00:46:55,603 --> 00:46:56,846
Yeah?

889
00:46:56,846 --> 00:46:59,541
Look, Marian,
they can't find us.

890
00:46:59,541 --> 00:47:02,214
Maybe they're waiting
for us to find them.

891
00:47:02,214 --> 00:47:04,117
That's the only place
we'd know to call.

892
00:47:04,117 --> 00:47:06,284
But why would we get
in touch with them?

893
00:47:07,188 --> 00:47:09,188
Sell it back, shake 'em down.

894
00:47:09,188 --> 00:47:11,784
Which, incidentally,
is not such a bad idea.

895
00:47:11,784 --> 00:47:13,192
Jamie.

896
00:47:13,192 --> 00:47:14,897
Look, I didn't invent extortion.

897
00:47:14,897 --> 00:47:16,899
But, Jamie,
why would Susanne help us?

898
00:47:16,899 --> 00:47:18,296
She hates you.

899
00:47:18,296 --> 00:47:21,365
Oh, she's had
two days to cool off.

900
00:47:21,365 --> 00:47:23,532
Get the fuck back
in that lockup.

901
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:26,909
Officer Kracik said
I could speak to my attorney.

902
00:47:26,909 --> 00:47:29,340
Attorney?
Are you a college boy?

903
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:32,508
Officer Kracik said
I could speak to my lawyer.

904
00:47:32,508 --> 00:47:34,840
Officer Kracik
ain't running booking.

905
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,545
I'm running booking, jackass.

906
00:47:36,545 --> 00:47:38,679
- He said...
- You want me to walk over there

907
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:40,285
and kick your number-running ass

908
00:47:40,285 --> 00:47:42,287
back into
the Delaware fucking River?

909
00:47:42,287 --> 00:47:45,125
Who's running booking?

910
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:46,896
- You are.
- Who is?

911
00:47:46,896 --> 00:47:49,030
- You are.
- No fucking shit!

912
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:50,691
- Shink!
- Yeah.

913
00:47:50,691 --> 00:47:52,066
Telephone.

914
00:47:53,498 --> 00:47:54,794
Sergeant Shinkleman.

915
00:47:54,794 --> 00:47:56,763
Hey. It's me.

916
00:47:56,763 --> 00:47:58,468
<i>Oh, what a lovely surprise.</i>

917
00:47:58,468 --> 00:48:00,800
Sukie, come on, now.
Let's be friends. I...

918
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,275
Did the two creeps find you?
<i>- What?</i>

919
00:48:03,275 --> 00:48:05,244
The two weirdos looking for you.

920
00:48:05,244 --> 00:48:06,509
I tried to be helpful.

921
00:48:07,413 --> 00:48:09,413
Uh, but who were they?
<i>- How should I know?</i>

922
00:48:09,413 --> 00:48:11,316
Bill collectors,
herpes patients.

923
00:48:11,316 --> 00:48:13,186
Two more people
you fucked over somehow.

924
00:48:13,186 --> 00:48:15,991
<i>- George and Lennie.</i>
- George and Lennie?

925
00:48:17,126 --> 00:48:19,852
<i>Of Mice and Men.</i>
Have you read any books?

926
00:48:19,852 --> 00:48:21,524
Books, maybe not, but, sweetie,

927
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:23,394
I'm gonna help you break
a big murder case.

928
00:48:23,394 --> 00:48:25,693
"Break a big murder case"?

929
00:48:25,693 --> 00:48:28,498
<i>Just go over
to Curlie's Drive-Away.</i>

930
00:48:28,498 --> 00:48:30,533
Curlie's Drive-Away?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

931
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:33,305
<i>And you ask Curlie about...</i>

932
00:48:33,305 --> 00:48:35,670
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Turn that down!

933
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:38,772
Ask him about the what
in the attaché case?

934
00:48:38,772 --> 00:48:41,148
<i>You should see what they got
locked up in that thing.</i>

935
00:48:41,148 --> 00:48:42,710
Jamie, that is about

936
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:45,416
the dumbest thing
I've ever heard, and I'm a cop.

937
00:48:45,416 --> 00:48:47,418
Why would I make it up?
Just go to Curlie's Drive-Away.

938
00:48:47,418 --> 00:48:48,991
I guarantee you someone's there.

939
00:48:48,991 --> 00:48:51,587
You guarantee?
I'm supposed to believe you?

940
00:48:51,587 --> 00:48:54,029
Fine. You know what?
If no one's there,

941
00:48:54,029 --> 00:48:55,855
I'll take Alice.

942
00:48:55,855 --> 00:48:57,461
<i>Really? Swear?</i>

943
00:48:57,461 --> 00:48:59,694
Yes, I swear. I pussy-promise.
I will take the dog.

944
00:48:59,694 --> 00:49:02,466
You'll never have to deal
with her again.

945
00:49:03,337 --> 00:49:05,568
<i>A juke joint where?</i>

946
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:07,603
Wetumpka, Alabama.

947
00:49:07,603 --> 00:49:09,242
Well, outside of Wetumpka.

948
00:49:09,242 --> 00:49:10,507
They hadn't been there,

949
00:49:10,507 --> 00:49:13,939
but a very personable
music lover

950
00:49:13,939 --> 00:49:15,611
told us of another juke joint

951
00:49:15,611 --> 00:49:17,514
- fairly close by called...
- You see?

952
00:49:17,514 --> 00:49:18,713
Stop!

953
00:49:18,713 --> 00:49:20,484
Called Ike's.

954
00:49:21,355 --> 00:49:23,355
<i>Maybe he said "Mike's."</i>

955
00:49:23,355 --> 00:49:25,093
<i>Maybe he said "Mike."</i>

956
00:49:25,093 --> 00:49:27,260
Uh, "Mike" or... But whatever.

957
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:29,130
I think the soccer team
was just confused

958
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:31,132
about which joint
these girls were going to,

959
00:49:31,132 --> 00:49:32,694
so we're gonna drive...

960
00:49:32,694 --> 00:49:35,400
Stop saying words.

961
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,073
One of the girls
finally used a credit card.

962
00:49:38,073 --> 00:49:39,635
They arrived in Tallahassee

963
00:49:39,635 --> 00:49:43,177
and checked into a hotel
called El Conquistador.

964
00:49:44,004 --> 00:49:45,377
Tallahassee.

965
00:49:45,377 --> 00:49:47,016
<i>I want you to get
your asses over there</i>

966
00:49:47,016 --> 00:49:49,117
<i>and take care of it right away.</i>

967
00:49:49,117 --> 00:49:50,613
Not a juke joint.

968
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:52,252
You should arrive
by early morning.

969
00:49:52,252 --> 00:49:53,385
I'll meet you there.

970
00:49:53,385 --> 00:49:55,651
Uh, I'll level with you, Chief.

971
00:49:55,651 --> 00:49:57,620
Flint and me could use
a little shut-eye.

972
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,556
We have not slept
since the night before last,

973
00:49:59,556 --> 00:50:01,657
and we...

974
00:50:01,657 --> 00:50:03,263
Hello?

975
00:50:04,497 --> 00:50:06,695
- Chief?
- Who's in Tallahassee?

976
00:50:07,698 --> 00:50:09,170
Certainly.

977
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:11,106
There are a number of places
I can recommend locally,

978
00:50:11,106 --> 00:50:12,536
or right here at the hotel,

979
00:50:12,536 --> 00:50:15,077
we have Espadrilles
for casual dining,

980
00:50:15,077 --> 00:50:16,705
or we have Baxter's by the Pool,

981
00:50:16,705 --> 00:50:19,741
which is our more elegant venue
down in the lower level.

982
00:50:20,876 --> 00:50:22,183
Maybe we should stay here.

983
00:50:22,183 --> 00:50:23,712
Replenish the ice.

984
00:50:28,222 --> 00:50:30,323
This is great, but how...

985
00:50:30,323 --> 00:50:32,721
Ladies, are we enjoying
a beverage this evening?

986
00:50:34,263 --> 00:50:36,395
Rainbow.

987
00:50:36,395 --> 00:50:37,528
Yes.

988
00:50:37,528 --> 00:50:39,992
Uh, can we get
some champagne, please?

989
00:50:39,992 --> 00:50:41,730
Like, a really, really good one?

990
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:42,797
Of course.

991
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:46,834
Won't you have to pay
for the card at some point?

992
00:50:46,834 --> 00:50:48,440
Theoretically.

993
00:50:56,879 --> 00:50:58,120
So...

994
00:51:00,014 --> 00:51:03,158
I've been thinking
about it, and...

995
00:51:04,557 --> 00:51:08,020
...finally dawned on me that
you are not the kind of person

996
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:11,727
that a girl brings to
a roadside motel for a quickie.

997
00:51:12,565 --> 00:51:14,631
Now, I have heard of
the more soulful sex

998
00:51:14,631 --> 00:51:17,634
where you have a nice dinner
and conversation first

999
00:51:17,634 --> 00:51:19,570
so it all comes out of
someplace deeper,

1000
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:22,408
but I usually have stuff to do.

1001
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:25,213
Perrier-Jouët Belle Epoque '95.

1002
00:51:25,213 --> 00:51:27,743
You mean you want
to sleep with me?

1003
00:51:28,713 --> 00:51:32,286
Marian, you have got to have
a good, steamy fuck.

1004
00:51:32,286 --> 00:51:34,288
Something I decided

1005
00:51:34,288 --> 00:51:35,784
last night
while I was lying in bed

1006
00:51:35,784 --> 00:51:38,787
before I started masturbating,
and I figure,

1007
00:51:38,787 --> 00:51:43,055
it's important to me,
I should take care of it myself.

1008
00:51:43,055 --> 00:51:44,529
Especially since, with you,

1009
00:51:44,529 --> 00:51:46,564
it's got to be with somebody
who cares for you.

1010
00:51:46,564 --> 00:51:47,632
Am I right?

1011
00:51:48,634 --> 00:51:51,140
Can't just be a finger
jiggling your clit and adios.

1012
00:51:52,407 --> 00:51:54,209
- Thank you.
- My pleasure. Madame?

1013
00:51:54,209 --> 00:51:55,738
Yes, please.

1014
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:57,938
But is it a good idea
for us to have sex?

1015
00:51:57,938 --> 00:51:59,544
I mean, we're good friends,

1016
00:51:59,544 --> 00:52:01,546
and maybe it's not supposed
to be more than that.

1017
00:52:01,546 --> 00:52:02,976
Maybe we shouldn't risk
ruining it.

1018
00:52:02,976 --> 00:52:06,584
Look, you can always find
reasons to not have sex,

1019
00:52:06,584 --> 00:52:09,554
and if you think about them
too much, guess what.

1020
00:52:09,554 --> 00:52:11,754
- You never have sex.
- Exactly.

1021
00:52:11,754 --> 00:52:13,723
Like my high school
guidance counselor.

1022
00:52:13,723 --> 00:52:16,330
She was always saying
that this or that

1023
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:18,200
- would be inappropriate.
- Uh-huh.

1024
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,466
But when I finally
got her to relax,

1025
00:52:22,096 --> 00:52:23,403
the sex was great.

1026
00:52:23,403 --> 00:52:25,273
Ladies, have we decided?

1027
00:52:27,475 --> 00:52:29,673
Don't rush us, buddy.

1028
00:52:30,412 --> 00:52:33,710
First, we'll dance.

1029
00:52:44,657 --> 00:52:48,527
Maybe I do overthink things.

1030
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,530
Yeah.

1031
00:52:52,665 --> 00:52:55,534
Got to keep that brain loose,
let that mind fly.

1032
00:52:59,505 --> 00:53:02,739
There was this one time
I was with Debbie Augenblick.

1033
00:53:02,739 --> 00:53:04,070
Ah, you know Debbie.

1034
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:07,139
She's got this humongous dildo
she's got mounted

1035
00:53:07,139 --> 00:53:08,712
on a Black & Decker
circular sander,

1036
00:53:08,712 --> 00:53:11,880
and she had me going
like my brains were gonna

1037
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,651
come out the top
of my freaking skull.

1038
00:53:13,651 --> 00:53:16,082
I mean, I came like the
Grand Burlington motherfuck...

1039
00:53:16,082 --> 00:53:21,461
<i>♪ Watch the sunrise
from a tropic isle ♪</i>

1040
00:53:23,223 --> 00:53:26,928
<i>♪ Just remember, darling ♪</i>

1041
00:53:26,928 --> 00:53:29,469
<i>♪ All the while ♪</i>

1042
00:53:31,473 --> 00:53:36,245
<i>♪ You belong to me... ♪</i>

1043
00:56:08,696 --> 00:56:10,322
One accomplishment.

1044
00:56:10,322 --> 00:56:12,566
Huh? Name me one.

1045
00:56:12,566 --> 00:56:15,030
At least I'm in the arena
dealing with people.

1046
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:16,966
Those girls wound you up
like a top.

1047
00:56:17,936 --> 00:56:20,772
Flint, have you ever
fucked a woman

1048
00:56:20,772 --> 00:56:22,510
on a creaky porch swing

1049
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:24,237
on a warm summer evening--
crickets, so forth?

1050
00:56:24,237 --> 00:56:27,548
I mean, just fucked her
like there's no tomorrow,

1051
00:56:27,548 --> 00:56:29,418
trousers around your ankles,

1052
00:56:29,418 --> 00:56:31,816
belt jangling,
yelling to beat the band,

1053
00:56:31,816 --> 00:56:34,555
slamming away
like a Cincinnati jackhammer.

1054
00:56:34,555 --> 00:56:36,590
Yes, people might stroll by

1055
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:38,119
and see you
looking foolish up there

1056
00:56:38,119 --> 00:56:39,560
slapping ham on the veranda,

1057
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:42,596
but that is the price you pay
for interaction.

1058
00:56:42,596 --> 00:56:45,126
If this is too messy for you,
then you will spend

1059
00:56:45,126 --> 00:56:47,766
the rest of
your miserable fucking life

1060
00:56:47,766 --> 00:56:50,802
just hitting people and then
pulling your measly little pud.

1061
00:56:50,802 --> 00:56:52,166
Can't wait to tell the chief.

1062
00:56:52,166 --> 00:56:54,509
Yeah, and why don't you
also tell him

1063
00:56:54,509 --> 00:56:56,445
that you're
a social fucking imbecile

1064
00:56:56,445 --> 00:56:58,139
that I've been carrying
on my back

1065
00:56:58,139 --> 00:57:00,416
all the way from Philadelphia!

1066
00:57:18,533 --> 00:57:20,161
Help.

1067
00:57:29,106 --> 00:57:30,677
"Big case."

1068
00:57:31,471 --> 00:57:33,075
That woman.

1069
00:57:36,652 --> 00:57:39,378
Won't anybody save Curlie?

1070
00:58:00,335 --> 00:58:02,170
Wake me in Tallahassee.

1071
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:03,842
Yes, sir.

1072
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:27,761
Honey, we eating soon?

1073
00:59:27,761 --> 00:59:29,598
Okay.

1074
00:59:31,591 --> 00:59:33,833
Oh. All right.

1075
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:07,394
Jamie?

1076
01:00:07,394 --> 01:00:12,366
Waited for you
as long as I could.

1077
01:00:14,601 --> 01:00:16,612
Jamie, no!

1078
01:00:24,785 --> 01:00:26,347
Jamie, why?

1079
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:33,992
Oh, my God.

1080
01:00:33,992 --> 01:00:35,323
Marian.

1081
01:00:36,458 --> 01:00:38,227
Sir?

1082
01:00:38,227 --> 01:00:39,833
- Sir.
- Hmm?

1083
01:00:40,902 --> 01:00:42,836
Tallahassee, sir.

1084
01:00:42,836 --> 01:00:45,597
Where to, exactly?

1085
01:00:45,597 --> 01:00:47,808
Yes, um...

1086
01:00:48,602 --> 01:00:49,744
The track.

1087
01:00:49,744 --> 01:00:51,812
Dog track? Yes, sir.

1088
01:00:51,812 --> 01:00:53,605
Those penises are trouble,
Jamie.

1089
01:00:53,605 --> 01:00:55,079
Oh, come on now.

1090
01:00:55,079 --> 01:00:57,917
I thought you were
gonna loosen up.

1091
01:00:57,917 --> 01:00:59,853
You gonna work your way
through all of them?

1092
01:00:59,853 --> 01:01:02,152
No. I like this one.

1093
01:01:03,155 --> 01:01:05,727
Oh, come on. Don't be mad.

1094
01:01:06,356 --> 01:01:07,553
Last night was beautiful,

1095
01:01:07,553 --> 01:01:09,225
but you fell asleep
and I didn't get my turn

1096
01:01:09,225 --> 01:01:10,831
on the waterslide,
if you know what I'm saying.

1097
01:01:10,831 --> 01:01:12,657
Okay! -All right!

1098
01:01:12,657 --> 01:01:15,066
Everyone, relax. Stay calm.

1099
01:01:15,066 --> 01:01:17,002
We're here for two things.

1100
01:01:18,333 --> 01:01:20,137
Careful with that thing,
you fucking moron!

1101
01:01:20,137 --> 01:01:21,842
Screw you!

1102
01:01:21,842 --> 01:01:23,668
We're here for two items.

1103
01:01:23,668 --> 01:01:25,076
Whoa. She's naked.

1104
01:01:25,076 --> 01:01:27,474
All right, no big deal.
Just a naked lady.

1105
01:01:27,474 --> 01:01:28,849
We're here for two items.

1106
01:01:28,849 --> 01:01:30,983
Yes, this. Please and thank you.

1107
01:01:30,983 --> 01:01:33,084
- And the head box.
- Head box!

1108
01:01:33,084 --> 01:01:34,888
Fuck you!
Don't you fucking lecture me!

1109
01:01:34,888 --> 01:01:36,956
All right, ladies.
No need to panic. One more time.

1110
01:01:36,956 --> 01:01:38,991
Please and thank you.
We're all friends here.

1111
01:01:38,991 --> 01:01:41,620
Two items. Don't panic. Okay.

1112
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:43,864
Let's get this show on the road.

1113
01:01:45,558 --> 01:01:47,802
Yeah, baby.

1114
01:01:47,802 --> 01:01:55,040
You're such a big, bouncy,
beautiful baby.

1115
01:01:56,109 --> 01:01:58,846
Love doesn't have to die, baby.

1116
01:02:00,608 --> 01:02:02,344
Whoa.

1117
01:02:02,344 --> 01:02:04,753
This is so groovy.

1118
01:02:04,753 --> 01:02:07,756
Now I can love you forever.

1119
01:02:07,756 --> 01:02:09,384
Whoa.

1120
01:02:09,384 --> 01:02:10,792
And ever

1121
01:02:11,652 --> 01:02:15,357
and ever and ever

1122
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:20,494
- and ever and ever.
- And ever and ever.

1123
01:02:20,494 --> 01:02:24,971
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1124
01:02:24,971 --> 01:02:29,074
Never to wilt,
never to wane.

1125
01:02:29,074 --> 01:02:33,705
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1126
01:02:33,705 --> 01:02:38,017
Never to wilt,
never to wane.

1127
01:02:38,017 --> 01:02:41,746
Never to wilt, never to wane.

1128
01:02:41,746 --> 01:02:45,420
Never to wilt...

1129
01:02:49,226 --> 01:02:50,964
Took 'em straight here.

1130
01:02:50,964 --> 01:02:52,130
Haven't debriefed 'em, Chief.

1131
01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:54,132
Figured you want to do
the talking.

1132
01:02:57,731 --> 01:02:59,434
This is all they had?

1133
01:02:59,434 --> 01:03:01,172
What's all they had?

1134
01:03:02,307 --> 01:03:06,848
Ladies, you're a day late
and a dick short.

1135
01:03:06,848 --> 01:03:08,883
What are you talking about?

1136
01:03:08,883 --> 01:03:11,116
The senator's penis
is not in the case!

1137
01:03:11,116 --> 01:03:13,613
- Not in the...
- Well, that just figures.

1138
01:03:13,613 --> 01:03:15,285
Come on, girls.

1139
01:03:15,285 --> 01:03:16,990
Where's the last phallus?

1140
01:03:20,191 --> 01:03:22,490
You didn't check the case
before you left?

1141
01:03:22,866 --> 01:03:24,459
I-I...

1142
01:03:24,459 --> 01:03:26,098
He's been stepping on his dick
the whole way down, Chief.

1143
01:03:26,098 --> 01:03:28,001
What have you done, jerk-off?

1144
01:03:28,001 --> 01:03:29,871
I got the Spanish guy's head,
Einstein!

1145
01:03:29,871 --> 01:03:31,334
They gave you the combination,

1146
01:03:31,334 --> 01:03:33,336
and it still took you
15 minutes!

1147
01:03:33,336 --> 01:03:35,041
- I never slip up.
- Right, left,

1148
01:03:35,041 --> 01:03:36,845
past the first number.

1149
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:53,224
The senator is a good man.

1150
01:03:54,095 --> 01:03:56,997
He smoked marijuana
once in college.

1151
01:03:56,997 --> 01:03:58,361
Many of us did.

1152
01:03:58,361 --> 01:04:00,869
It was a different time.

1153
01:04:00,869 --> 01:04:03,938
He went to a party
and met a hippie chick,

1154
01:04:03,938 --> 01:04:06,468
Tiffany Plaster Caster.

1155
01:04:12,608 --> 01:04:13,915
Housekeeping.

1156
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:20,185
She took a plaster cast
of his excited...

1157
01:04:21,881 --> 01:04:23,221
...thing.

1158
01:04:24,587 --> 01:04:28,523
She made one model
of each of her "old men."

1159
01:04:31,132 --> 01:04:33,660
At the time, the senator
didn't know that someday

1160
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:36,905
he'd be called on to serve
his community, his state,

1161
01:04:36,905 --> 01:04:39,534
and perhaps someday, his nation.

1162
01:04:41,604 --> 01:04:42,834
He was just a kid.

1163
01:04:46,145 --> 01:04:50,149
His penis passed
from hand to hand.

1164
01:04:50,149 --> 01:04:52,283
Finally ended up
with an international collector

1165
01:04:52,283 --> 01:04:55,187
named
Alejandro Santos y Obrador.

1166
01:04:55,187 --> 01:04:58,586
You saw him, sort of.

1167
01:05:13,502 --> 01:05:16,802
This penis cannot become
a piece of merchandise.

1168
01:05:16,802 --> 01:05:19,442
Think of it: eBay,

1169
01:05:19,442 --> 01:05:23,743
"Senator Gary Channel's
ding-dong, lightly used."

1170
01:05:23,743 --> 01:05:26,218
Comments, reviews.

1171
01:05:26,218 --> 01:05:28,616
Think of what
it would do to him.

1172
01:05:28,616 --> 01:05:32,994
His children, his family,
his career.

1173
01:05:36,263 --> 01:05:39,198
We're not unreasonable.

1174
01:05:39,198 --> 01:05:40,969
We'll gladly pay for it.

1175
01:05:41,895 --> 01:05:42,927
We just...

1176
01:05:42,927 --> 01:05:44,896
Will you please shut up!

1177
01:05:44,896 --> 01:05:46,106
That wasn't my idea!

1178
01:05:46,106 --> 01:05:47,734
I was just trying
to keep us awake.

1179
01:05:47,734 --> 01:05:48,801
I was experimenting.

1180
01:05:48,801 --> 01:05:50,077
But you liked it.

1181
01:05:50,077 --> 01:05:51,375
- No, I didn't!
- I could tell.

1182
01:05:51,375 --> 01:05:53,113
Hey, it was the Irish coffee.
I was drunk!

1183
01:05:53,113 --> 01:05:54,543
Drunk on cock.

1184
01:05:54,543 --> 01:05:56,347
- No! I didn't.
- It's not my thing.

1185
01:05:56,347 --> 01:05:58,019
I was just trying
to help you be a man.

1186
01:05:58,019 --> 01:05:59,911
- To understand life.
- No!

1187
01:05:59,911 --> 01:06:02,518
- The stuff of life!
- No, no, no!

1188
01:06:05,092 --> 01:06:08,029
God, man,
what are you doing?!

1189
01:06:41,493 --> 01:06:42,525
Mommy.

1190
01:07:04,483 --> 01:07:06,186
All right, we have to
get back to the hotel

1191
01:07:06,186 --> 01:07:07,682
and grab the penis
out of the bed.

1192
01:07:07,682 --> 01:07:08,947
Then we switch hotels.

1193
01:07:08,947 --> 01:07:11,059
You grab the penis.
I'll meet you at the hotel.

1194
01:07:11,059 --> 01:07:12,489
Okay. The La Lanterna.

1195
01:07:12,489 --> 01:07:14,887
I'll check in
under the name Abzug.

1196
01:07:14,887 --> 01:07:17,131
- Where are you going?
- Art store.

1197
01:07:24,303 --> 01:07:26,470
Next customer, please.

1198
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:29,275
Shinkleman.
Going to Tallahassee.

1199
01:07:29,275 --> 01:07:31,002
Don't ask me why.

1200
01:07:33,807 --> 01:07:35,578
<i>Committee to Reelect.</i>

1201
01:07:35,578 --> 01:07:37,415
I need to speak to the senator.

1202
01:07:37,415 --> 01:07:40,946
<i>Well, who should I say
is calling?</i>

1203
01:07:40,946 --> 01:07:43,355
Someone who has his...

1204
01:07:44,853 --> 01:07:47,062
...personal effects.

1205
01:08:17,985 --> 01:08:20,491
<i>Who is this?</i>

1206
01:08:20,491 --> 01:08:21,822
Senator?

1207
01:08:21,822 --> 01:08:24,297
<i>Yes. Who is this?</i>

1208
01:08:24,297 --> 01:08:27,168
Somebody who wants
a million dollars.

1209
01:08:27,168 --> 01:08:30,765
If you can get it by tonight,
you can have your thing back.

1210
01:08:30,765 --> 01:08:32,404
Everybody's things.

1211
01:08:32,404 --> 01:08:35,176
I'll tell you where to bring
the money. Come alone.

1212
01:08:35,176 --> 01:08:37,178
If you're not alone,

1213
01:08:37,178 --> 01:08:39,213
believe me, I'll know it.

1214
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:50,455
Someone named Jamie Dobbs

1215
01:08:50,455 --> 01:08:52,050
made a phone call
from here last night.

1216
01:08:52,050 --> 01:08:53,326
Uh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

1217
01:08:54,956 --> 01:08:56,824
Well, this is for her.

1218
01:08:56,824 --> 01:08:58,265
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.

1219
01:08:58,265 --> 01:08:59,530
You've missed them.

1220
01:08:59,530 --> 01:09:02,269
Um, her-her friend
just checked them out.

1221
01:09:22,225 --> 01:09:23,851
Done.

1222
01:09:25,855 --> 01:09:26,887
With what?

1223
01:09:26,887 --> 01:09:29,230
Tell you later.
I'm gonna clean up.

1224
01:09:30,057 --> 01:09:31,595
Want to join me?

1225
01:10:01,055 --> 01:10:02,593
Jamie.

1226
01:10:04,729 --> 01:10:06,333
I want...

1227
01:10:06,333 --> 01:10:07,928
Uh-huh?

1228
01:10:07,928 --> 01:10:10,997
I... I-I want...

1229
01:10:10,997 --> 01:10:13,505
What do you want, sugar sweet?

1230
01:10:15,608 --> 01:10:18,103
I want to make love
with the senator's penis.

There's the head of one of the
bigger Fortune 500 companies.

1253
01:12:34,549 --> 01:12:37,649
The owner of
a large-market football team.

1254
01:12:39,246 --> 01:12:40,850

crackhead phone call about?

Wha-What do you mean?
How'd you know I'd be here?

How many dyke bars are there

1285
01:14:25,592 --> 01:14:27,220
they put us in the back
of a Toyota Tercel

1286
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:29,024
and took us to the dog track,
and I'm sure

1287
01:14:29,024 --> 01:14:30,894
they were gonna kill us,
but lucky for us,

1288
01:14:30,894 --> 01:14:32,698
they had left
the most important penis behind.

1289
01:14:32,698 --> 01:14:35,932
Well, you've had a full day.

1290
01:14:38,838 --> 01:14:41,102
She's yours now.

1291
01:14:42,468 --> 01:14:45,141
Hang on. This doesn't look good.

1292
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:03,927
Motherfucker.

1293
01:15:12,707 --> 01:15:14,608
What's she chasing?

1294
01:15:14,608 --> 01:15:16,038
Yeah.

1295
01:15:16,777 --> 01:15:18,106
We forgot to tell you about

1296
01:15:18,106 --> 01:15:20,339
the suave guy's head
in the hatbox.

1297
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:30,657
Boy, I think
I could win against him.

1298
01:15:30,657 --> 01:15:32,659
And now we get to just
keep on going.

1299
01:15:32,659 --> 01:15:35,090
Who's gonna complain
if we keep the car?

1300
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:37,389
Things could not have
worked out better.

1301
01:15:37,389 --> 01:15:39,633
Well, I guess.

1302
01:15:40,361 --> 01:15:42,031
What's wrong?

1303
01:15:42,031 --> 01:15:46,101
I am fully aware that the
senator is a terrible person,

1304
01:15:46,101 --> 01:15:48,466
but I have to admit,

1305
01:15:48,466 --> 01:15:50,336
I'll miss his...

1306
01:15:50,336 --> 01:15:51,744
No worries, girl.

1307
01:15:52,505 --> 01:15:54,241
I made a cast.

1308
01:15:54,241 --> 01:15:55,880
And two copies.

1309
01:15:57,653 --> 01:15:59,114
Great.

1310
01:15:59,114 --> 01:16:00,687
But why two?

1311
01:16:00,687 --> 01:16:02,282
For each other.

1312
01:16:02,282 --> 01:16:04,449
Ladies, your visitor is here.

1313
01:16:04,449 --> 01:16:06,484
Can we get our car?

1314
01:16:06,484 --> 01:16:09,960
You know, hers and hers.

1315
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:14,965
Aunt Ellis.

1316
01:16:16,265 --> 01:16:17,770
Oh, hello, darling.

1317
01:16:17,770 --> 01:16:19,365
- She's your aunt?
- Uh-huh.

1318
01:16:19,365 --> 01:16:20,773
Uncle John met her in church.

1319
01:16:20,773 --> 01:16:22,566
Watch what you say.
She's very religious.

1320
01:16:22,566 --> 01:16:24,810
So good to see you.

1321
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:27,010
This is my friend Jamie.

1322
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:28,616
Oh, how are you,
young lady?

1323
01:16:28,616 --> 01:16:30,112
This your first time
in Tallahassee?

1324
01:16:30,112 --> 01:16:32,884
Yes, ma'am,
and what a beautiful city.

1325
01:16:32,884 --> 01:16:35,689
- Not like Miami.
- Oh, no, no.

1326
01:16:35,689 --> 01:16:37,922
Not like Miami.

1327
01:16:37,922 --> 01:16:39,891
You able to stay with us long?

1328
01:16:39,891 --> 01:16:41,354
No, unfortunately...

1329
01:16:41,354 --> 01:16:43,059
Right after birding,
we're off to Massachusetts.

1330
01:16:43,059 --> 01:16:45,127
- We just decided last night.
- Jamie.

1331
01:16:45,127 --> 01:16:46,931
Well, what do they have
in Massachusetts

1332
01:16:46,931 --> 01:16:49,527
that we don't have right here
in North Florida?

1333
01:16:49,527 --> 01:16:51,639
Women can get married there.

1334
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:57,205
To each other?

1335
01:16:59,682 --> 01:17:01,011
Hmm.

1336
01:17:02,014 --> 01:17:04,784
Well, that's an innovation.

1337
01:17:19,427 --> 01:17:21,295
