1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,507
(ominous music)

2
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,363
[Joey] Let's just do it from here.

3
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:26,891
Alright, Dan?

4
00:00:26,891 --> 00:00:27,766
[Dan] Yeah.

5
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,578
[Joey] All right, the security camera's just there

6
00:00:31,578 --> 00:00:33,378
[Dan] Where those two pillars are?

7
00:00:33,378 --> 00:00:35,418
The gas tank though, you've got the big tank there.

8
00:00:35,418 --> 00:00:38,200
The gas chamber is, it's more to the right,

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,473
it's more towards the puff.

10
00:00:40,612 --> 00:00:43,279
(ominous music)

11
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,298
[Joey] So my heart's pounding.

12
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:50,733
My body was saying, get the hell out of here.

13
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,868
My worst nightmares were coming through.

14
00:00:53,868 --> 00:00:54,960
I'd have to leave it.

15
00:00:56,043 --> 00:00:57,048
(suspenseful music)

16
00:00:57,048 --> 00:00:59,109
If I'm not willing to risk my life

17
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:00,708
to expose what's happening to them,

18
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,853
then I don't really care about it enough.

19
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,494
(upbeat music)

20
00:01:06,494 --> 00:01:09,704
You're on private property, bye-bye.

21
00:01:09,704 --> 00:01:12,663
(machine whirring)

22
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:19,396
(ominous music)

23
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,318
[Joey's Father] Hey Joey, what do you got from there?

24
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:34,578
So, ever since I was a little kid,

25
00:01:34,578 --> 00:01:37,623
I was always an animal lover, but I really love pigs.

26
00:01:39,244 --> 00:01:41,058
(upbeat music)

27
00:01:41,058 --> 00:01:43,098
Honestly think the catalyst
for me loving pigs so much

28
00:01:43,098 --> 00:01:44,688
was the movie "Babe".

29
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:47,085
And after watching that I would
always draw pictures of pigs

30
00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:49,008
and I was at school making cutouts of pigs,

31
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:52,308
and they were just the main
characters in all my drawings.

32
00:01:52,308 --> 00:01:54,648
My name is Joey, I'm from the northern suburbs

33
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:56,478
of South Australia.

34
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:58,758
I come from a broken home and my dad left

35
00:01:58,758 --> 00:02:00,138
when I was really young.

36
00:02:00,138 --> 00:02:01,698
From about the age of 14,

37
00:02:01,698 --> 00:02:04,128
I started experimenting with drugs.

38
00:02:04,128 --> 00:02:06,648
I started becoming acclimated
to street violence actually.

39
00:02:06,648 --> 00:02:08,238
Things progressed, like what happens

40
00:02:08,238 --> 00:02:10,098
is the environment starts to shape you.

41
00:02:10,098 --> 00:02:12,858
The violence started to step up a notch as well

42
00:02:12,858 --> 00:02:16,818
and it was just a crazy, crazy world.

43
00:02:16,818 --> 00:02:17,748
'Cause when you start getting

44
00:02:17,748 --> 00:02:20,028
to higher level organized crime,

45
00:02:20,028 --> 00:02:21,648
there's starting to be power struggles,

46
00:02:21,648 --> 00:02:23,208
there starting to be wars on the streets,

47
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,458
and there was shootings, and
assassinations were happening.

48
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,858
There were stabbings but it was the amount of drugs

49
00:02:27,858 --> 00:02:30,018
I was using that started to spiral my mental health.

50
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:31,608
And it happens over the course of years.

51
00:02:31,608 --> 00:02:34,548
And yeah, so I always had a gun on me for protection.

52
00:02:34,548 --> 00:02:37,518
You're really stupid if you
didn't actually in that world.

53
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:39,708
And I remember one night I
was on the run from the police

54
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,618
and they caught up with me at a cheap hotel,

55
00:02:42,618 --> 00:02:46,893
and they found the firearm down my trousers, and bang,

56
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,798
it was the sobriety that prison gave me

57
00:02:51,798 --> 00:02:54,918
that made me start analyzing
my life from a new perspective.

58
00:02:54,918 --> 00:02:57,408
I started seeing that my actions have reactions

59
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,818
and I started thinking to myself,

60
00:02:58,818 --> 00:03:00,648
do I really wanna stay here for the rest of my life?

61
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:02,190
'Cause that's where I'm going.

62
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:04,308
(gentle music)

63
00:03:04,308 --> 00:03:05,898
So when I got released from prison,

64
00:03:05,898 --> 00:03:07,488
it was an amazing feeling.

65
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:11,328
I was like so grateful for my
freedom, and to see my family,

66
00:03:11,328 --> 00:03:13,818
and I just knew what I'd lost,

67
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,098
and I knew what I could lose at that point.

68
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:21,140
But that sobriety is what made
me change my whole mindset.

69
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,228
I started to really think of my future

70
00:03:24,228 --> 00:03:27,303
and I started thinking, what the gang life, not for me.

71
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,288
That was one of the most anxious times in my life

72
00:03:30,288 --> 00:03:31,938
actually being sober and leaving the gangs

73
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:34,548
and I had an existential crisis.

74
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,508
I didn't know who I was.

75
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:39,258
I had an identity crisis but I stayed strong

76
00:03:39,258 --> 00:03:42,693
and stayed sober, and that
was the beginning of my new life.

77
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,038
So people might think it's pretty funny

78
00:03:46,038 --> 00:03:47,478
for an ex-gang member,

79
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:51,108
but even to this day I still really love pigs.

80
00:03:51,108 --> 00:03:52,878
You are my favorite animal ever.

81
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:54,299
Look at you.

82
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,687
Hello, hello.

83
00:03:58,886 --> 00:03:59,778
I just love pigs.

84
00:03:59,778 --> 00:04:00,611
Hey, bud.

85
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:02,110
Do I get a cuddle?

86
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:02,943
I love their demeanor.

87
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:04,938
I love their intelligence.

88
00:04:04,938 --> 00:04:08,028
I love the way that they care for their families.

89
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:11,268
Some are playful, some are lazy,

90
00:04:11,268 --> 00:04:14,058
and they all have their own unique personalities.

91
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:16,068
They're all individuals.

92
00:04:16,068 --> 00:04:17,510
What do you know about pigs?

93
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,331
[Interviewee 1] They're cute when they're small,

94
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:20,739
and they trot around and stuff.

95
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:21,651
[Joey] They're cute.

96
00:04:21,651 --> 00:04:24,768
Let's see, pigs are a domestic and wild animal.

97
00:04:24,768 --> 00:04:26,778
They're found throughout the world

98
00:04:26,778 --> 00:04:28,818
and people think they're dirty

99
00:04:28,818 --> 00:04:30,287
but they're actually quite clean.

100
00:04:30,287 --> 00:04:31,691
They got a curly tail.

101
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:33,566
A little like noses.

102
00:04:36,155 --> 00:04:37,578
They've got a language of their own.

103
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:39,858
Have many varieties and colors.

104
00:04:39,858 --> 00:04:41,538
[Joey] So what do you know about pigs?

105
00:04:41,538 --> 00:04:46,580
They live in pens and we tend to eat a lot of them.

106
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,738
I don't know much about pig.

107
00:04:48,738 --> 00:04:51,273
I know you can get the most meat off of them.

108
00:04:52,377 --> 00:04:53,628
(ominous music)

109
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:56,193
Easy to keep good for sausages, bacon.

110
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,718
[Joey] What many people don't know about pigs

111
00:04:59,718 --> 00:05:01,818
is everything that happens to them in order to end up

112
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:03,123
on the supermarket shelf.

113
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,948
I can't blame anyone for not knowing.

114
00:05:06,948 --> 00:05:09,348
I had been fooled for most of my life,

115
00:05:09,348 --> 00:05:11,778
but when I found out what was really going on,

116
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,313
I had to do everything in my power to expose it.

117
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:18,956
(ominous music)

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,098
The majority of pigs in the
UK are killed in gas chambers.

119
00:05:25,098 --> 00:05:27,498
The meat industry say it's humane,

120
00:05:27,498 --> 00:05:29,268
but they definitely don't want the public to see

121
00:05:29,268 --> 00:05:30,860
what's going on inside of them.

122
00:05:32,357 --> 00:05:35,024
(ominous music)

123
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,428
No one has ever planted cameras
inside of a UK gas chamber.

124
00:05:40,428 --> 00:05:41,703
I needed to change that,

125
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:44,118
but it would be the most dangerous thing

126
00:05:44,118 --> 00:05:45,963
I've ever attempted in my life.

127
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,508
For months I studied gas chamber blueprints.

128
00:05:50,508 --> 00:05:52,848
I had to consider so many different variables.

129
00:05:52,848 --> 00:05:54,843
Any mistake could be fatal.

130
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,389
(ominous music)

131
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,100
I couldn't do this alone.

132
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,418
So I asked my partner Tarion
to come along for the journey

133
00:06:05,418 --> 00:06:08,088
and I turned to Dan to go in as an undercover employee.

134
00:06:08,088 --> 00:06:09,030
Put a ladder here.

135
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,603
This here is the access point.

136
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,248
And then we will climb up there

137
00:06:16,248 --> 00:06:19,308
and walk across the roof to the stairwell.

138
00:06:19,308 --> 00:06:22,068
Yeah, there's a stairwell, external stairwell.

139
00:06:22,068 --> 00:06:26,809
Once we get on there, then it's just a walk around

140
00:06:26,809 --> 00:06:28,188
and then the pigs are here.

141
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:30,152
So I'm 53 years old, you know what I mean?

142
00:06:30,152 --> 00:06:32,118
I should be sat at home in me slippers and my pipe now.

143
00:06:32,118 --> 00:06:33,741
But I need to do it.

144
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:34,968
I need to do it.

145
00:06:34,968 --> 00:06:38,433
I spent 48 years of my life paying for this abuse.

146
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,318
So I've got a lot of karma to pay back.

147
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,518
You know what I mean?

148
00:06:43,518 --> 00:06:44,943
A lot of karma to pay back.

149
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,728
And this is the only way I know how to do it.

150
00:06:49,728 --> 00:06:52,788
Because we know what's happening to the animals,

151
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,948
we can't just sit by and let that happen.

152
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:58,728
We have to do everything in our power to help them.

153
00:06:58,728 --> 00:07:02,088
Joey started planning this
even before we met in 2019

154
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,498
when he first told me about it all,

155
00:07:03,498 --> 00:07:06,185
I was like, you are planning to do what?

156
00:07:06,185 --> 00:07:07,608
It was just so many things to think about

157
00:07:07,608 --> 00:07:10,938
and it was something that
we were discussing every night

158
00:07:10,938 --> 00:07:13,428
and every day for almost a year.

159
00:07:13,428 --> 00:07:16,578
So if God forsake anything does happen,

160
00:07:16,578 --> 00:07:19,113
most I can do is ring 999.

161
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,961
He looks like a Frank.

162
00:07:22,961 --> 00:07:24,201
You look like a Frank.

163
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:25,034
I wouldn't get away with Frank.

164
00:07:25,034 --> 00:07:26,178
He's Frank all over.

165
00:07:26,178 --> 00:07:27,408
You get away with Benny though.

166
00:07:27,408 --> 00:07:28,788
Yeah, you definitely get away with Benny.

167
00:07:28,788 --> 00:07:29,621
I'm a Benny.

168
00:07:29,621 --> 00:07:31,650
Yeah, you look like a Benny.

169
00:07:32,608 --> 00:07:35,275
(ominous music)

170
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:42,782
This one is yours.

171
00:07:42,782 --> 00:07:45,491
(ominous music)

172
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:50,649
So that's my lifeline.

173
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,397
(ominous music)

174
00:07:56,137 --> 00:07:59,637
We wear these and then we wear the hats.

175
00:08:00,635 --> 00:08:01,468
Mask.

176
00:08:03,847 --> 00:08:07,427
Yeah, we've gotta be carrying that.

177
00:08:07,427 --> 00:08:10,136
(ominous music)

178
00:08:16,544 --> 00:08:18,622
Test, test check.

179
00:08:18,622 --> 00:08:21,331
(ominous music)

180
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,268
When Joey and I first met, I didn't know

181
00:08:35,268 --> 00:08:37,668
that he was a well-known activist

182
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:39,528
and when we were getting to know each other

183
00:08:39,528 --> 00:08:41,208
I learned all about his background,

184
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,978
how he turned his life around

185
00:08:42,978 --> 00:08:45,191
and began his work for animals.

186
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,717
Animals do not want to die.

187
00:08:47,619 --> 00:08:48,597
It's just the world we live in.

188
00:08:48,597 --> 00:08:50,598
It's a frustrating situation not being able to run

189
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:51,438
and help these pigs.

190
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:53,615
But the best way we can help is to advocate for them

191
00:08:53,615 --> 00:08:55,458
and be their voice.

192
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:58,788
And things have stepped up and stepped up

193
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,678
as I've been an activist over the years,

194
00:09:00,678 --> 00:09:02,478
and I keep pushing the envelope.

195
00:09:02,478 --> 00:09:03,858
Understand that the language

196
00:09:03,858 --> 00:09:06,558
of what they're trying to
say but suffering is universal.

197
00:09:06,558 --> 00:09:07,878
You can see in their eyes.

198
00:09:07,878 --> 00:09:10,308
So in 2015, Animal Liberation Victoria

199
00:09:10,308 --> 00:09:13,698
released an investigation into the gas chambers

200
00:09:13,698 --> 00:09:15,498
in Victoria, Australia.

201
00:09:15,498 --> 00:09:16,668
[Reporter] The action coincided

202
00:09:16,668 --> 00:09:18,558
with the release of footage, the group claims

203
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,718
shows abuse in the pork industry.

204
00:09:20,718 --> 00:09:23,268
Members say it's part of a two-year investigation

205
00:09:23,268 --> 00:09:26,328
where one of the activists
infiltrated a gas chamber.

206
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:28,548
That was the first time I'd ever seen pigs

207
00:09:28,548 --> 00:09:29,658
in gas chambers.

208
00:09:29,658 --> 00:09:32,208
And it was extremely shocking to me.

209
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,578
I didn't even know they were using these machines.

210
00:09:34,578 --> 00:09:35,958
I'd heard about them in history,

211
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,238
I didn't know they were using 'em on animals.

212
00:09:38,238 --> 00:09:41,745
And the idea you get when you hear about,

213
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:43,608
oh, the meat industry used gas chambers

214
00:09:43,608 --> 00:09:45,858
is they must be using some type of sleeping gas.

215
00:09:45,858 --> 00:09:48,558
So it must be painless.

216
00:09:48,558 --> 00:09:50,838
And it's the impression that the marketing

217
00:09:50,838 --> 00:09:52,608
of the meat gives you.

218
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:55,248
It's like well it's humane slaughter,

219
00:09:55,248 --> 00:09:56,613
but that's not the case.

220
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,288
I did center my activism around gas chambers

221
00:10:00,288 --> 00:10:01,368
from that point onwards.

222
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:03,648
It would be one of my main talking points

223
00:10:03,648 --> 00:10:06,768
because to me I couldn't believe these machines

224
00:10:06,768 --> 00:10:09,408
actually existed to kill these intelligent beings.

225
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:14,450
Do you know about gas chamber in the meat industry?

226
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:15,990
Gas chambers?

227
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,946
Not in the meat industry, no.

228
00:10:16,946 --> 00:10:19,286
Do you know about gas chambers?

229
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,119
Yeah.

230
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:20,952
For pigs?

231
00:10:20,952 --> 00:10:22,758
Ah, really?

232
00:10:22,758 --> 00:10:25,248
I thought you were talking
about the Second World War

233
00:10:25,248 --> 00:10:26,081
or something.

234
00:10:26,081 --> 00:10:27,185
Yeah, but.

235
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:28,018
Oh, I didn't know.

236
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:28,905
I don't know anything about it

237
00:10:28,905 --> 00:10:30,048
but I rather not know really

238
00:10:30,048 --> 00:10:34,248
'cause it's pretty nasty, innit really?

239
00:10:34,248 --> 00:10:35,523
They gas the pigs?

240
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,578
Yeah.

241
00:10:37,578 --> 00:10:40,173
Do you know anything about CO2 gas chambers?

242
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:42,673
Yeah.

243
00:10:42,673 --> 00:10:43,506
See this is why we're talking to people actually,

244
00:10:43,506 --> 00:10:44,785
'cause a lot of people don't know.

245
00:10:44,785 --> 00:10:45,618
No.

246
00:10:45,618 --> 00:10:47,178
[Joey] The first gas chamber was designed in the 1850s

247
00:10:47,178 --> 00:10:49,770
by the British physician, Benjamin Ward Richardson.

248
00:10:50,988 --> 00:10:53,208
In 1952 with the rise of factory farming,

249
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,848
Hormel Foods introduced the
concept of CO2 gas stunning

250
00:10:55,848 --> 00:10:58,938
to the meat industry in the
USA, the practice was adopted

251
00:10:58,938 --> 00:11:01,728
by the famous wiener manufacturer, Oscar Mayer,

252
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:04,142
notorious for advertising
their product to children

253
00:11:04,142 --> 00:11:07,941
♪ Oh, I'd love to be an Oscar Mayer wiener ♪

254
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:10,698
By 1970, CO2 was introduced in Europe

255
00:11:10,698 --> 00:11:13,398
and in 1988 gas chamber manufacturer, Butina,

256
00:11:13,398 --> 00:11:16,278
had a hundred installations across the EU.

257
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:17,658
Right from the outset,

258
00:11:17,658 --> 00:11:20,118
the industry promoted this method as humane.

259
00:11:20,118 --> 00:11:21,678
This pamphlet from the seventies claimed

260
00:11:21,678 --> 00:11:23,770
that the animals are gently put to sleep.

261
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,358
So gas chambers are used across the world

262
00:11:26,358 --> 00:11:28,548
on many different species of animals.

263
00:11:28,548 --> 00:11:31,158
The spent egg-laying hens will be gassed.

264
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:32,478
The little male chicks that don't make it

265
00:11:32,478 --> 00:11:34,698
to the egg industry will be gassed.

266
00:11:34,698 --> 00:11:37,068
We got chickens in the meat industry are gassed.

267
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:39,018
Turkeys as well are gassed.

268
00:11:39,018 --> 00:11:42,648
There's also sometimes it's used on salmon and fish.

269
00:11:42,648 --> 00:11:47,448
But the main method for pigs across Australia,

270
00:11:47,448 --> 00:11:51,468
the US, Europe, and the UK is a CO2 gas chamber.

271
00:11:51,468 --> 00:11:53,418
Is there a humane way to do this?

272
00:11:53,418 --> 00:11:56,568
How would you feel if you were used for your body,

273
00:11:56,568 --> 00:11:58,218
confined into a cage, and the only thing

274
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,408
you had to look forward to at the end of your life

275
00:12:00,408 --> 00:12:01,473
is a gas chamber?

276
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,888
So when I found out about the chambers,

277
00:12:03,888 --> 00:12:05,568
I started campaigning in Australia

278
00:12:05,568 --> 00:12:07,998
and then I took it to the world stage, and went to the UK,

279
00:12:07,998 --> 00:12:09,348
and done a lot of campaigns over there.

280
00:12:09,348 --> 00:12:10,728
I've been in slaughterhouse myself.

281
00:12:10,728 --> 00:12:12,678
I've been out the front of gas chambers in Manchester,

282
00:12:12,678 --> 00:12:14,538
and hearing pigs scream for their lives.

283
00:12:14,538 --> 00:12:16,428
High-welfare slaughter is a fairytale,

284
00:12:16,428 --> 00:12:17,463
that is nonsense.

285
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:19,968
But everything sort of went up a notch

286
00:12:19,968 --> 00:12:23,133
when I come across this notorious
gas chamber in Manchester.

287
00:12:25,316 --> 00:12:26,988
(ominous music)

288
00:12:26,988 --> 00:12:28,188
Pilgrim's Pride is owned

289
00:12:28,188 --> 00:12:31,038
by the Brazilian multinational giant JBS,

290
00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:32,780
the world's largest meat producer.

291
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,058
Its customers include

292
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:38,238
just about every major
supermarket chain you can think of,

293
00:12:38,238 --> 00:12:40,788
plus several fast food outlets.

294
00:12:40,788 --> 00:12:43,518
On the Manchester site alone, some three-quarters

295
00:12:43,518 --> 00:12:46,203
of a million pigs are gassed and killed each year.

296
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,698
It has been a focus of a lot
of animal rights protestors

297
00:12:49,698 --> 00:12:50,531
over the years.

298
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:52,420
A lot of people know about this place.

299
00:12:54,387 --> 00:12:57,054
(ominous music)

300
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,878
It's actually notorious
because it's located smack bang

301
00:13:01,878 --> 00:13:03,168
in a suburban area.

302
00:13:03,168 --> 00:13:04,728
There's actually a path

303
00:13:04,728 --> 00:13:06,468
that goes down the back of the chamber

304
00:13:06,468 --> 00:13:08,118
where people walk their dogs

305
00:13:08,118 --> 00:13:10,188
and you can hear the pigs screaming

306
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:11,703
and it's really haunting.

307
00:13:12,753 --> 00:13:15,740
(pigs screaming)

308
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,848
[Dog walker] You know the screams are pigs.

309
00:13:16,848 --> 00:13:17,681
[Joey] Yeah.

310
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:18,748
[Dog Walker 2] Well, yeah,

311
00:13:18,748 --> 00:13:19,581
but mom used to like vegetarian food as well.

312
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:20,414
[Dog walker] I used to, I told you my mom used to live

313
00:13:20,414 --> 00:13:21,684
in the third house on there.

314
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:22,517
[Joey] Yeah.

315
00:13:22,517 --> 00:13:23,350
[Dog walker] I used to see 'em queuing up.

316
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,183
[Joey] Yeah.

317
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:25,016
[Dog walker] They was screaming.

318
00:13:25,016 --> 00:13:25,849
[Dog Walker 2] I used to live on Wall Street,

319
00:13:25,849 --> 00:13:28,020
and the trucks had come,

320
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,058
and I could hear from my bedroom window,

321
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,488
the pigs would wake us up about seven in the morning,

322
00:13:31,488 --> 00:13:32,755
screaming.

323
00:13:32,755 --> 00:13:33,588
[Dog walker] Yeah.

324
00:13:33,588 --> 00:13:34,421
[Dog Walker 2] And then my mum said to me,

325
00:13:34,421 --> 00:13:35,254
they know they're gonna die.

326
00:13:35,254 --> 00:13:36,087
[Dog walker] Of course, they do,

327
00:13:36,087 --> 00:13:36,920
they know it's coming.

328
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,958
They can sense it, yeah.

329
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,428
I had that thought to myself,

330
00:13:40,428 --> 00:13:42,678
I thought if I really care about these animals,

331
00:13:42,678 --> 00:13:46,128
these animals have to experience that terror

332
00:13:46,128 --> 00:13:48,498
before they go down into
that gas, and they're screaming,

333
00:13:48,498 --> 00:13:50,241
and they're like little infants in their mind.

334
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:55,283
They don't understand, and they scream in terror,

335
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,028
and beg for mercy and no one cares.

336
00:13:59,028 --> 00:14:01,128
And I heard those screams for so many years

337
00:14:01,128 --> 00:14:05,238
and I thought they have to experience

338
00:14:05,238 --> 00:14:08,478
a horrible factory farm and go into this death pit.

339
00:14:08,478 --> 00:14:13,008
And if I'm not willing to risk my life

340
00:14:13,008 --> 00:14:14,328
to expose what's happening to them,

341
00:14:14,328 --> 00:14:16,578
then I don't really care about it enough.

342
00:14:16,578 --> 00:14:18,918
And that's sort of the way I evaluated it in my mind.

343
00:14:18,918 --> 00:14:20,808
I was like, I've gotta do this.

344
00:14:20,808 --> 00:14:22,158
I have to do this.

345
00:14:22,158 --> 00:14:25,863
And it was something inside of me pushing me to do it.

346
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:33,065
(pigs screaming)

347
00:14:33,065 --> 00:14:35,774
(ominous music)

348
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,328
Placing cameras inside of these chambers

349
00:14:41,328 --> 00:14:42,948
wasn't gonna be easy.

350
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:45,228
That slaughterhouse is very secure.

351
00:14:45,228 --> 00:14:47,385
There's workers there 24/7,

352
00:14:47,385 --> 00:14:49,758
there's CCTV that's constantly operating

353
00:14:49,758 --> 00:14:52,022
and there are security guards on site.

354
00:14:52,022 --> 00:14:54,180
Get out.

355
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,594
You're on private property.

356
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:56,552
Bye-Bye.

357
00:14:56,552 --> 00:14:57,385
Private property

358
00:14:57,385 --> 00:14:58,260
Bye-Bye.

359
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:03,318
They wouldn't let someone
like me get a job at this place.

360
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:05,238
I'm a well-known person.

361
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,158
I've got a large social media presence

362
00:15:07,158 --> 00:15:10,458
so I couldn't be the one to go into this place.

363
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:13,008
So the plan was we needed a worker to go in there,

364
00:15:13,008 --> 00:15:15,363
do some groundwork, find out about the place.

365
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,508
I can't do everything,

366
00:15:17,508 --> 00:15:20,000
but I had a pretty good person in mind who could.

367
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,538
Breaking news and some activists

368
00:15:26,538 --> 00:15:30,138
have chained themselves off
and caused a total shutdown.

369
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,638
The police are there.

370
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:33,348
So we're gonna see how close we can get.

371
00:15:33,348 --> 00:15:34,638
See if we can get some footage.

372
00:15:34,638 --> 00:15:36,348
Maybe go live on Instagram.

373
00:15:36,348 --> 00:15:37,181
[Police Officer] Stay back a bit.

374
00:15:37,181 --> 00:15:38,434
[Dan] Alright.

375
00:15:38,434 --> 00:15:39,267
You don't need to touch me, mate.

376
00:15:39,267 --> 00:15:41,298
I just thought he's really courageous

377
00:15:41,298 --> 00:15:43,890
and he'd be the perfect person to go in undercover.

378
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,514
Okay.

379
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:48,978
So I went for the induction.

380
00:15:48,978 --> 00:15:51,528
What I did find funny was the woman

381
00:15:51,528 --> 00:15:54,018
who was taking the induction,

382
00:15:54,018 --> 00:15:57,648
she talked about the vegan
activists outside, who protest.

383
00:15:57,648 --> 00:16:01,848
And I've been one of those a few times over the months.

384
00:16:01,848 --> 00:16:04,308
And then she turned around and she said,

385
00:16:04,308 --> 00:16:07,743
but don't worry there's a lot of security at this place.

386
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:14,030
So there'd be no vegan activists
getting inside the factory.

387
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,407
Boop, she looked right at me

388
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,468
and I just couldn't help but smile.

389
00:16:18,468 --> 00:16:22,503
And I'm here, I'm already here, girl.

390
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,648
So this is where the pigs are kept.

391
00:16:27,648 --> 00:16:31,848
The pigs were kept in horrible dirty conditions.

392
00:16:31,848 --> 00:16:33,590
As you can hear they're screaming.

393
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,410
They were scared.

394
00:16:36,331 --> 00:16:38,478
(pigs screaming)

395
00:16:38,478 --> 00:16:41,767
I'm going to try and hide this camera somewhere.

396
00:16:43,891 --> 00:16:46,908
They were kept in rooms right next to the gas chamber.

397
00:16:46,908 --> 00:16:48,950
So they come up here, come up this ramp,

398
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,370
come into the gas chamber here.

399
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:03,297
(pigs screaming)

400
00:17:03,297 --> 00:17:05,497
They come out the gas chamber there,

401
00:17:05,497 --> 00:17:08,223
which is right next door to where the pigs are kept,

402
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,828
and this is the fell floor.

403
00:17:13,828 --> 00:17:15,753
Yeah, it's not very nice work at all.

404
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,518
The induction itself gave me a bit of indication

405
00:17:19,518 --> 00:17:22,908
about what type of people that they employ.

406
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:26,478
People who haven't got any qualifications,

407
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:29,298
can only basic reading and writing skills,

408
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,918
which it isn't a bad thing.

409
00:17:30,918 --> 00:17:31,805
I don't see that as a bad thing,

410
00:17:31,805 --> 00:17:35,313
but it just speaks volumes about the type of work.

411
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:39,378
People who work in slaughterhouses

412
00:17:39,378 --> 00:17:41,268
when they're engaging in the killing

413
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,708
or harmful behavior towards animals.

414
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,628
That's quite a traumatic experience,

415
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:47,718
especially if they have high
empathy towards animals.

416
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:49,218
And that traumatic experience

417
00:17:49,218 --> 00:17:52,128
can lead to mental health difficulties.

418
00:17:52,128 --> 00:17:54,078
So people who work in slaughterhouses

419
00:17:54,078 --> 00:17:57,198
are significantly more likely
to experience depression,

420
00:17:57,198 --> 00:17:59,628
anxiety, and other mental health difficulties

421
00:17:59,628 --> 00:18:02,448
where they're now having to work out a way to cope

422
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:06,078
with those experiences so
that they can get the job done.

423
00:18:06,078 --> 00:18:08,298
Being low-income workers,

424
00:18:08,298 --> 00:18:10,038
they don't feel like they can leave this job

425
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:10,938
and go and do something else.

426
00:18:10,938 --> 00:18:13,008
They have to find a way to get through it.

427
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,164
Yeah.

428
00:18:14,164 --> 00:18:16,638
So animals are the primary
victims of slaughterhouses,

429
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:19,608
but the workers there are also affected.

430
00:18:19,608 --> 00:18:21,528
My research focuses on the social

431
00:18:21,528 --> 00:18:22,518
and psychological factors

432
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:26,088
associated with why people harm animals.

433
00:18:26,088 --> 00:18:29,478
But more recently I've become
interested in this paradox

434
00:18:29,478 --> 00:18:32,238
of people who can legally kill animals

435
00:18:32,238 --> 00:18:34,758
and whether that's a psychological harm on them.

436
00:18:34,758 --> 00:18:38,688
So you can have two people
who commit the exact same act.

437
00:18:38,688 --> 00:18:41,898
One will be a cow, one will be a dog, but one will be paid

438
00:18:41,898 --> 00:18:43,790
and one will be convicted of offense.

439
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,308
What you'll find is that
there are typically two types

440
00:18:49,308 --> 00:18:51,348
of people who work in slaughterhouses.

441
00:18:51,348 --> 00:18:54,018
You'll have the one type
where they are self-selecting

442
00:18:54,018 --> 00:18:55,308
that form of employment.

443
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:57,198
There's something about
working in a slaughterhouse

444
00:18:57,198 --> 00:18:59,538
that draws them in.

445
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,818
Unfortunately, they tend to be the type of people

446
00:19:01,818 --> 00:19:04,638
who want to act out their aggression.

447
00:19:04,638 --> 00:19:08,388
They wanna act out more
antisocial ideas in that environment

448
00:19:08,388 --> 00:19:10,248
and they get paid to do that.

449
00:19:10,248 --> 00:19:13,278
The other type are the people who probably

450
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:14,778
would be considered a bit more vulnerable

451
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,968
because they've been trying to get employment

452
00:19:16,968 --> 00:19:19,458
in any sphere that they can.

453
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,678
But the slaughterhouse is the one opportunity

454
00:19:21,678 --> 00:19:24,018
that they've been successful in gaining

455
00:19:24,018 --> 00:19:27,618
and as a result they are not coming in with the idea

456
00:19:27,618 --> 00:19:29,688
to harm animals or kill animals,

457
00:19:29,688 --> 00:19:31,008
they just know that this is a job

458
00:19:31,008 --> 00:19:32,538
where they're gonna have to do this.

459
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:36,048
Not understanding what impact it might have on them

460
00:19:36,048 --> 00:19:37,503
and their wider family.

461
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,028
I worked at the slaughterhouse in Manchester.

462
00:19:41,028 --> 00:19:43,938
For me, it would've been the last place I wanted to work,

463
00:19:43,938 --> 00:19:47,253
but because I was on such hard times, I needed the job.

464
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,958
My misses were pregnant and was about to have a baby.

465
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:54,228
So for me, it wasn't a second guess of a question that,

466
00:19:54,228 --> 00:19:56,628
yes, on Monday I start there.

467
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,027
So I started on a Monday.

468
00:19:59,027 --> 00:20:00,978
(ominous music)

469
00:20:00,978 --> 00:20:03,218
You walk in and the first thing you see

470
00:20:03,218 --> 00:20:05,868
is piglets hanging from the ceiling

471
00:20:05,868 --> 00:20:08,220
and hooks going through the skin.

472
00:20:09,165 --> 00:20:11,508
And below them is just a river bed of blood

473
00:20:11,508 --> 00:20:14,508
that's just flowing all the way through the abattoir.

474
00:20:14,508 --> 00:20:16,518
And in the background, you can hear the piglets

475
00:20:16,518 --> 00:20:17,895
squealing for their lives.

476
00:20:17,895 --> 00:20:20,658
And it was our job to remove the pig's toenails

477
00:20:20,658 --> 00:20:22,338
and to burn, singe the hair off.

478
00:20:22,338 --> 00:20:26,238
And we'd rotate, me and this lad, and I seen

479
00:20:26,238 --> 00:20:31,280
and witnessed one of them
rip pig's eyeball out of its head

480
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,668
and kick it across the abattoir floor.

481
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:38,238
And they all just started
laughing between each other.

482
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:41,328
Nobody stood back in horror
and went, what are you doing?

483
00:20:41,328 --> 00:20:43,576
They become so desensitized to it.

484
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,998
They're there every day, a lot of them 12 hours a day.

485
00:20:46,998 --> 00:20:48,858
They have been for 20 years.

486
00:20:48,858 --> 00:20:51,648
I had to run out of the abattoir and ring my partner

487
00:20:51,648 --> 00:20:53,898
and say, I can't physically do this.

488
00:20:53,898 --> 00:20:54,773
It's not right.

489
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,908
The screaming I feel stays with me.

490
00:20:58,908 --> 00:21:02,118
But even more so than the eye.

491
00:21:02,118 --> 00:21:03,910
I know that doesn't sound the best,

492
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:08,470
but just hearing them, it's
like hearing a person scream

493
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,938
before they're killed.

494
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:14,235
They just echo through the abattoir

495
00:21:14,235 --> 00:21:17,155
and it's something of nightmares.

496
00:21:17,155 --> 00:21:19,451
(pigs screaming)

497
00:21:19,451 --> 00:21:21,708
Hearts, lungs, guts.

498
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,738
Yeah, I work in slaughterhouses.

499
00:21:24,738 --> 00:21:28,818
And I would be assessing for disease,

500
00:21:28,818 --> 00:21:31,818
any issues within the carcass
and looking at the tails.

501
00:21:31,818 --> 00:21:35,628
And sometimes you'd end up going down to the gut room

502
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:39,858
and looking at how many
worms were coming out and stuff.

503
00:21:39,858 --> 00:21:42,548
You're quite a pivotal role as a vet in the industry

504
00:21:42,548 --> 00:21:47,590
in that you work with Red
Tractor, RSPCA, laboratories,

505
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,408
pharmaceutical companies, nutritionists,

506
00:21:51,408 --> 00:21:54,288
geneticists, and of course, the producers.

507
00:21:54,288 --> 00:21:56,838
And then four years I spent as a pig vet,

508
00:21:56,838 --> 00:21:58,878
so commercial pig vet.

509
00:21:58,878 --> 00:22:03,920
And that involved working
with hundreds of Britain's farms

510
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,768
covering a huge area of England.

511
00:22:06,768 --> 00:22:08,838
I mean they stink as well, these places,

512
00:22:08,838 --> 00:22:12,828
you can smell the fear, the gut contents,

513
00:22:12,828 --> 00:22:16,818
the excrement, the blood, like hot blood,

514
00:22:16,818 --> 00:22:18,123
burning skin and hair.

515
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,338
Yeah, the slaughterhouse work
has obviously stayed with me

516
00:22:22,338 --> 00:22:24,363
for some time.

517
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,748
Working in slaughterhouses

518
00:22:26,748 --> 00:22:28,998
is quite a traumatic experience.

519
00:22:28,998 --> 00:22:32,238
There's no amount of
preparation that people can have,

520
00:22:32,238 --> 00:22:33,378
even though they're going in

521
00:22:33,378 --> 00:22:34,728
knowing that they're gonna kill animals.

522
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:37,758
But once you walk through
the door, all the sensory stimuli

523
00:22:37,758 --> 00:22:40,008
that you experience is overwhelming.

524
00:22:40,008 --> 00:22:42,648
And so as much as possible to keep,

525
00:22:42,648 --> 00:22:44,478
maintain that employment,

526
00:22:44,478 --> 00:22:47,088
people will develop these coping mechanisms

527
00:22:47,088 --> 00:22:48,588
to look after themselves.

528
00:22:48,588 --> 00:22:50,688
Unfortunately, they can be quite problematic

529
00:22:50,688 --> 00:22:52,518
like drugs or alcohol.

530
00:22:52,518 --> 00:22:55,548
This could spill out in terms of aggression

531
00:22:55,548 --> 00:22:57,978
and violence in their personal lives.

532
00:22:57,978 --> 00:22:59,028
That could be in their homes

533
00:22:59,028 --> 00:23:00,918
or it could be out amongst others.

534
00:23:00,918 --> 00:23:03,318
I often drive by the slaughterhouse

535
00:23:03,318 --> 00:23:05,271
but I live five minutes up the road.

536
00:23:05,271 --> 00:23:08,598
So every time I do it takes me back to that place

537
00:23:08,598 --> 00:23:11,328
of where I can hear them screams,

538
00:23:11,328 --> 00:23:13,278
I can see that river of blood,

539
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:17,200
I can see them people abusing the carcasses

540
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:23,508
and it's not nice, it stays with me.

541
00:23:23,508 --> 00:23:24,900
It stays with me every day.

542
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,343
I'm already here, girl.

543
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:39,498
So then she talked about the shifts

544
00:23:39,498 --> 00:23:42,228
and she said there's a hygiene team that worked

545
00:23:42,228 --> 00:23:45,318
from four till midnight, which
I jumped up straight away,

546
00:23:45,318 --> 00:23:46,458
I says, I'll do that.

547
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,478
She was so happy

548
00:23:47,478 --> 00:23:50,550
because nobody wants to do that job you see.

549
00:23:51,617 --> 00:23:52,568
(ominous music)

550
00:23:52,568 --> 00:23:53,401
To be honest with you,

551
00:23:53,401 --> 00:23:57,218
this was the first major investigation I directed.

552
00:23:57,218 --> 00:23:59,388
So I was a little bit out of my depth,

553
00:23:59,388 --> 00:24:04,248
but I gave Dan some hidden cameras to start planting.

554
00:24:04,248 --> 00:24:07,248
Then on the following Monday I started,

555
00:24:07,248 --> 00:24:11,928
so what I did in the first
week was I started walking in

556
00:24:11,928 --> 00:24:14,988
and looking at places to place my camera

557
00:24:14,988 --> 00:24:19,455
and then just making a move towards them,

558
00:24:19,455 --> 00:24:22,308
and looking suspicious, and climbing on things,

559
00:24:22,308 --> 00:24:23,178
and looking over things.

560
00:24:23,178 --> 00:24:24,468
And I did this every day to see

561
00:24:24,468 --> 00:24:28,518
that if I got pulled in the office and I never did.

562
00:24:28,518 --> 00:24:33,093
So that was that, everything was set in place.

563
00:24:35,697 --> 00:24:38,364
(ominous music)

564
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,268
So Dan was looking for an opportunity

565
00:24:41,268 --> 00:24:44,200
to start placing these cameras and he ended up

566
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,973
placing them in a pretty good positions.

567
00:24:48,816 --> 00:24:51,483
(ominous music)

568
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,996
Yeah.

569
00:24:54,996 --> 00:24:56,790
So Dan first got me the kill floor footage

570
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:58,758
and when I saw it, I was like wow,

571
00:24:58,758 --> 00:25:00,978
we've really got a glimpse from inside of here.

572
00:25:00,978 --> 00:25:03,228
There'll be someone there
slapping the pigs on the back

573
00:25:03,228 --> 00:25:05,328
and pushing 'em into another compartment

574
00:25:05,328 --> 00:25:07,311
and then a mechanical door pushes them in.

575
00:25:07,311 --> 00:25:09,498
It's all machines and pushing

576
00:25:09,498 --> 00:25:11,088
these sentient conscious beings

577
00:25:11,088 --> 00:25:13,758
into this sort of death chamber.

578
00:25:13,758 --> 00:25:16,593
And then the door comes closing down behind the pigs.

579
00:25:18,697 --> 00:25:21,364
(ominous music)

580
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:28,128
I could see the footage
that he got from the kill floor.

581
00:25:28,128 --> 00:25:29,688
It's just something out of a horror story.

582
00:25:29,688 --> 00:25:32,778
These poor little childlike beings being strung up

583
00:25:32,778 --> 00:25:34,458
and stabbed to death all day.

584
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:35,598
Thousands of them.

585
00:25:35,598 --> 00:25:37,638
The pigs, their dead, lifeless bodies

586
00:25:37,638 --> 00:25:39,858
being dragged out by their little trotters

587
00:25:39,858 --> 00:25:40,998
and hanging down there.

588
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:42,048
It's just a pool of blood.

589
00:25:42,048 --> 00:25:47,090
And then, but I needed Dan to to get a glimpse

590
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,428
of inside the chamber.

591
00:25:48,428 --> 00:25:51,978
So I only asked them to put a
camera on the top of the hatch

592
00:25:51,978 --> 00:25:53,688
to get a glimpse of what happens

593
00:25:53,688 --> 00:25:54,980
to the pigs from the top.

594
00:25:56,835 --> 00:25:59,502
(ominous music)

595
00:26:02,317 --> 00:26:06,650
I looked in that gas chamber and it's really deep.

596
00:26:08,378 --> 00:26:11,000
I mean I was even going to plant a camera in the bottom

597
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,318
of the gas chamber and when I lifted the hatch

598
00:26:12,318 --> 00:26:13,635
and stuck my head and I could just smell the gas

599
00:26:13,635 --> 00:26:15,333
and I went dizzy instantly.

600
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:17,515
And I put that down, I thought no.

601
00:26:17,515 --> 00:26:18,663
Sod that, no way.

602
00:26:20,133 --> 00:26:21,858
(pigs screaming)

603
00:26:21,858 --> 00:26:23,028
What we're looking at here is the top

604
00:26:23,028 --> 00:26:25,503
of a two-story gas chamber sunk into the ground.

605
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:32,628
A carousel system of cages
takes the animals from the top

606
00:26:32,628 --> 00:26:35,118
right down to the bottom where the concentration

607
00:26:35,118 --> 00:26:36,933
of CO2 gas is deadliest.

608
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,058
So you can see the pigs going in,

609
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:42,678
you can see them from the top there.

610
00:26:42,678 --> 00:26:44,268
There's just one extra part we needed

611
00:26:44,268 --> 00:26:45,948
and that was inside the chambers

612
00:26:45,948 --> 00:26:49,068
to see what actually happens to their behavior

613
00:26:49,068 --> 00:26:50,748
when they're in that gas.

614
00:26:50,748 --> 00:26:52,068
But it's not gonna be easy either

615
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,978
to get a camera inside the cage.

616
00:26:54,978 --> 00:26:56,298
It's another level of risk.

617
00:26:56,298 --> 00:26:58,518
So you couldn't just do it as a worker in there

618
00:26:58,518 --> 00:27:00,978
and messing around on a ladder.

619
00:27:00,978 --> 00:27:03,858
It was something that needed a lot of planning.

620
00:27:03,858 --> 00:27:07,158
We needed to take in so many different variables,

621
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:10,188
there were so many different
things that could go wrong.

622
00:27:10,188 --> 00:27:11,953
Yeah, so this is the-

623
00:27:11,953 --> 00:27:13,627
I can't work that out.

624
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,188
So while planning the next phase of the mission,

625
00:27:16,188 --> 00:27:18,858
I wanted to hear from the
people who were still involved

626
00:27:18,858 --> 00:27:20,478
with the use of gas chambers.

627
00:27:20,478 --> 00:27:22,578
I wanted to see why they
were still using gas chambers

628
00:27:22,578 --> 00:27:24,063
to kill pigs.

629
00:27:24,063 --> 00:27:25,428
(ominous music)

630
00:27:25,428 --> 00:27:28,458
Especially, since the science on CO2 being so cruel

631
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:29,913
had been around for decades.

632
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:34,488
So it ended up, we reached
out to around 40 organizations

633
00:27:34,488 --> 00:27:37,038
including 12 animal research scientists.

634
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:39,858
And either no one got back at all

635
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,868
or people were just trying to handball us off

636
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:44,088
to other organizations.

637
00:27:44,088 --> 00:27:47,088
But finally, there was a breakthrough.

638
00:27:47,088 --> 00:27:48,978
The first to respond to our requests

639
00:27:48,978 --> 00:27:51,108
were some members involved with animal welfare

640
00:27:51,108 --> 00:27:53,088
For more than quarter of a century,

641
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:56,568
scientists have been clear that high levels

642
00:27:56,568 --> 00:27:58,518
of carbon dioxide for killing pigs

643
00:27:58,518 --> 00:28:01,875
causes severe respiratory distress.

644
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:05,208
And that the animals show a profound aversion

645
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:07,338
to that killing method.

646
00:28:07,338 --> 00:28:10,608
And this was not only the case

647
00:28:10,608 --> 00:28:12,438
from independent scientists,

648
00:28:12,438 --> 00:28:14,838
but the method has also been condemned

649
00:28:14,838 --> 00:28:19,158
by the UK's only government's
farm animal welfare council,

650
00:28:19,158 --> 00:28:21,258
way back in 2003.

651
00:28:21,258 --> 00:28:24,138
The European Union's own scientific committee,

652
00:28:24,138 --> 00:28:26,838
EFSA, condemned it in 2004

653
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:31,038
and reaffirmed that condemnation in 2020.

654
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:32,658
The science is clear.

655
00:28:32,658 --> 00:28:37,700
Killing pigs using carbon
dioxide is absolutely inhumane.

656
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,973
CO2 is currently used
because it's in the legislation.

657
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:45,228
The Animal Welfare Committee does not have a remit

658
00:28:45,228 --> 00:28:47,958
on what goes into legislation and what doesn't.

659
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:50,658
We only advise what could be in the legislation

660
00:28:50,658 --> 00:28:51,978
and what doesn't.

661
00:28:51,978 --> 00:28:57,020
So clearly we said in 2003 that
CO2 was not the best method

662
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,470
for using for the stunning pigs

663
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,528
and that we should phase it out if at all possible.

664
00:29:03,528 --> 00:29:07,818
That this cruel and
scientifically condemned method

665
00:29:07,818 --> 00:29:11,568
by scientist after scientist is now being adopted

666
00:29:11,568 --> 00:29:15,618
by the industry in the UK and internationally

667
00:29:15,618 --> 00:29:18,558
as the humane way to kill pigs.

668
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:19,638
Why is that?

669
00:29:19,638 --> 00:29:22,128
Because they can kill more pigs

670
00:29:22,128 --> 00:29:24,918
in the same premises at a lower cost.

671
00:29:24,918 --> 00:29:26,049
Yeah.

672
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:27,378
So in 2003, the Animal Welfare Committee,

673
00:29:27,378 --> 00:29:30,978
who are an arm of Defra called
for a ban on CO2 gas chambers

674
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:34,098
and they wanted that implemented
within the next five years.

675
00:29:34,098 --> 00:29:35,748
But that never happened.

676
00:29:35,748 --> 00:29:38,088
Our recommendation is to Defra

677
00:29:38,088 --> 00:29:43,130
and Defra's minister obviously
receives that information

678
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,903
and then can advise what action should be taken.

679
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,371
Alright.

680
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:53,283
I think maybe 'cause we're in
London, we should go to Defra.

681
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,898
So it'd been four months and we still hadn't gotten

682
00:29:56,898 --> 00:29:59,568
a response from these organizations,

683
00:29:59,568 --> 00:30:03,828
and I just got so sick of being hand-balled around

684
00:30:03,828 --> 00:30:06,411
and there was only one thing left to do.

685
00:30:06,411 --> 00:30:07,623
This is Defra.

686
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:09,910
[Security Guard] Hey.

687
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:10,743
Hey, mate.

688
00:30:10,743 --> 00:30:11,718
And a security guard stopped us out in the front

689
00:30:11,718 --> 00:30:13,208
and said no, you can't film in here.

690
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:14,628
Is this Defra here?

691
00:30:14,628 --> 00:30:16,098
[Security Guard] You can't film this in this bit.

692
00:30:16,098 --> 00:30:17,367
You've gotta stay there.

693
00:30:17,367 --> 00:30:18,304
Oh, that's all right.

694
00:30:18,304 --> 00:30:19,137
Do you wanna pass a message on

695
00:30:19,137 --> 00:30:20,887
that we are making a documentary,

696
00:30:20,887 --> 00:30:24,150
we want to speak to someone from the Defra office?

697
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,536
I dunno how you do it, but-

698
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:28,316
Oh, we're just gonna be filming out here anyway.

699
00:30:28,316 --> 00:30:29,149
No worries.

700
00:30:29,149 --> 00:30:31,615
[Security Guard] Thank you.

701
00:30:31,615 --> 00:30:32,648
(buzzer ringing)

702
00:30:32,648 --> 00:30:33,558
So we rang the buzzer

703
00:30:33,558 --> 00:30:35,988
at the British Meat Processes Association

704
00:30:35,988 --> 00:30:37,233
and no one was there.

705
00:30:38,219 --> 00:30:39,010
[BMPA Employee] You've reached

706
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,698
the British Meat Processes Association,

707
00:30:40,698 --> 00:30:41,898
how can I help you?

708
00:30:41,898 --> 00:30:44,208
We're just making an independent documentary

709
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:46,428
on the meat industry and we've been trying to email

710
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:49,788
to get someone from the industry to make a statement.

711
00:30:49,788 --> 00:30:51,408
Pilgrim's didn't get back to us either,

712
00:30:51,408 --> 00:30:53,388
so we decided to visit them at their headquarters.

713
00:30:53,388 --> 00:30:56,088
We've got a bunch of people making comments

714
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:59,928
and we don't have the other side making any comment.

715
00:30:59,928 --> 00:31:00,761
Have a seat.

716
00:31:00,761 --> 00:31:02,254
Yeah.

717
00:31:02,254 --> 00:31:03,787
[Pilgrim's Pride Employee] Sorry, who are you?

718
00:31:03,787 --> 00:31:04,827
My name's Joe.

719
00:31:04,827 --> 00:31:09,869
We're making a film on pig welfare, CO2, have mentioned.

720
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,668
Are you filming with that camera at the moment?

721
00:31:13,668 --> 00:31:17,148
We wanna ask those who
pride themselves on high-welfare

722
00:31:17,148 --> 00:31:20,088
and use gas chambers, why they use gas chambers,

723
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:21,547
why they use CO2?

724
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:25,635
[BMPA Employee] Well, I
think it's fairly well documented

725
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:30,228
that it's one of the humane methods of slaughter?

726
00:31:30,228 --> 00:31:31,938
Well, it's humane slaughter.

727
00:31:31,938 --> 00:31:34,368
[BMPA Employee] But actually,
we're all working from home,

728
00:31:34,368 --> 00:31:38,388
so unfortunately, there isn't anybody in the office.

729
00:31:38,388 --> 00:31:42,378
So yeah, well, they actually tried to get us in touch

730
00:31:42,378 --> 00:31:45,998
with the Farm Animal Welfare
Council but when we reached out

731
00:31:45,998 --> 00:31:47,688
to you guys for an interview.

732
00:31:47,688 --> 00:31:50,470
So clearly we said thousand in 2003.

733
00:31:51,413 --> 00:31:54,408
But the Farm Animal Welfare
Council, they actually called

734
00:31:54,408 --> 00:31:57,468
for a ban of CO2 gas chambers back in 2003.

735
00:31:57,468 --> 00:31:59,410
[BMPA Employee] I hadn't been aware.

736
00:32:00,612 --> 00:32:03,888
We declined to give a comment.

737
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:04,721
Why is that?

738
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:06,378
But we really wanna ask you

739
00:32:06,378 --> 00:32:09,505
because you only use gas chambers here.

740
00:32:09,505 --> 00:32:10,398
[Pilgrim's Pride Employee] Yep.

741
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:12,525
And you're predominantly pigs.

742
00:32:12,525 --> 00:32:13,358
[Pilgrim's Pride Employee] And I think

743
00:32:13,358 --> 00:32:15,828
it's widely accepted that gas stunning

744
00:32:15,828 --> 00:32:20,870
is currently the most humane
way of stunning animals.

745
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,995
Again humane slaughter.

746
00:32:23,995 --> 00:32:25,228
[Pilgrim's Pride Employee] And I know

747
00:32:25,228 --> 00:32:27,588
that there's a huge amount of research

748
00:32:27,588 --> 00:32:30,498
going into alternative methods at the moment.

749
00:32:30,498 --> 00:32:34,338
When you say it's the most humane method currently,

750
00:32:34,338 --> 00:32:36,213
but you're looking for alternatives,

751
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,748
why are you still killing pigs

752
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,838
if you know that that method is cruel?

753
00:32:40,838 --> 00:32:42,288
We told you we're making a documentary

754
00:32:42,288 --> 00:32:44,148
so there's no suspicion of us being a threat.

755
00:32:44,148 --> 00:32:45,528
There's no crime being committed.

756
00:32:45,528 --> 00:32:47,238
She looks like who works there, hey?

757
00:32:47,238 --> 00:32:50,568
But it turns out that the way that DEFRA greeted us

758
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:52,555
was with armed police.

759
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:53,898
[Police Officer 2] But essentially, if we suspect you

760
00:32:53,898 --> 00:32:55,215
of suspicious behavior, which I'm being honest.

761
00:32:55,215 --> 00:32:57,138
But we told 'em we're filming a documentary,

762
00:32:57,138 --> 00:32:59,242
they do legislation for the meat industry.

763
00:32:59,242 --> 00:33:00,075
[Police Officer 2] Oh okay.

764
00:33:00,075 --> 00:33:00,908
[Joey] So we're investigating the meat industry.

765
00:33:00,908 --> 00:33:01,741
[Police Officer 2] Yeah.

766
00:33:01,741 --> 00:33:02,924
We went to Defra see if anyone would come out

767
00:33:02,924 --> 00:33:05,958
'cause we tried to email them, call them.

768
00:33:05,958 --> 00:33:07,578
So we thought we're in the area.

769
00:33:07,578 --> 00:33:09,658
We'll go film a scene out the front of there.

770
00:33:09,658 --> 00:33:10,491
[Police Officer 2] Yeah.

771
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:12,438
They told the police that we were trying to encroach

772
00:33:12,438 --> 00:33:15,228
on the building so they lied to the police.

773
00:33:15,228 --> 00:33:16,188
We had nothing to hide.

774
00:33:16,188 --> 00:33:17,358
We showed 'em the footage.

775
00:33:17,358 --> 00:33:19,698
We're just there to do an interview basically.

776
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:21,648
Yeah, the police were just really nice.

777
00:33:21,648 --> 00:33:24,643
But wish I could say the same for Defra.

778
00:33:24,643 --> 00:33:25,476
[Police Officer 2] Take care.

779
00:33:25,476 --> 00:33:26,309
[Joey] Take care, mate.

780
00:33:26,309 --> 00:33:27,142
No worries, mate.

781
00:33:27,142 --> 00:33:27,975
[Police Officer 2] Enjoy your late lunch.

782
00:33:27,975 --> 00:33:28,808
[Joey] Thank you, mate.

783
00:33:28,808 --> 00:33:29,641
Appreciate it.

784
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:30,474
See you, buddy.

785
00:33:30,474 --> 00:33:31,908
The following week we did get
a written response from Defra.

786
00:33:31,908 --> 00:33:34,188
We are committed to
ensuring all animals are treated

787
00:33:34,188 --> 00:33:37,338
with the utmost respect at all stages of life.

788
00:33:37,338 --> 00:33:40,158
However, the government
recognizes that high concentrations

789
00:33:40,158 --> 00:33:43,008
of carbon dioxide are aversive to pigs.

790
00:33:43,008 --> 00:33:44,448
And alternative stunning methods

791
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:46,758
that can replace this in a commercial environment

792
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:47,928
need to be found.

793
00:33:47,928 --> 00:33:50,538
So this was the UK government telling me

794
00:33:50,538 --> 00:33:53,763
that they treat animals with the utmost respect.

795
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:57,978
How is it respectful to put these conscious,

796
00:33:57,978 --> 00:34:00,678
intelligent beings in a CO2 gas chamber

797
00:34:00,678 --> 00:34:02,568
that they know scientifically

798
00:34:02,568 --> 00:34:05,088
causes them immense suffering and fear?

799
00:34:05,088 --> 00:34:08,178
How on earth is that respect?

800
00:34:08,178 --> 00:34:09,588
They also mentioned the classic line

801
00:34:09,588 --> 00:34:11,403
about UK farming industry.

802
00:34:12,397 --> 00:34:14,268
"The government has a strong track record

803
00:34:14,268 --> 00:34:17,208
for raising the bar when it
comes to welfare measures."

804
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:19,188
This messaging is repeated over and over

805
00:34:19,188 --> 00:34:20,538
by industry spokespeople

806
00:34:20,538 --> 00:34:22,308
until it sinks into the minds of the public.

807
00:34:22,308 --> 00:34:25,608
When you think of UK farming, like what comes to mind?

808
00:34:25,608 --> 00:34:26,898
Free-range farms and everything like that.

809
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,388
So pretty good on the most parts of things.

810
00:34:29,388 --> 00:34:31,639
So UK is some of the highest
standards in the world maybe?

811
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,658
I would say so for sure.

812
00:34:32,658 --> 00:34:33,768
Yeah.

813
00:34:33,768 --> 00:34:34,938
When you're in Tesco, you ever see green grass

814
00:34:34,938 --> 00:34:37,188
and the animals in the grass and stuff like that?

815
00:34:37,188 --> 00:34:38,351
Yeah.

816
00:34:38,351 --> 00:34:39,184
And what does that tell you?

817
00:34:39,184 --> 00:34:40,017
Gives it a good picture.

818
00:34:40,017 --> 00:34:43,608
Mr. Speaker, The conservatives
were elected on a manifesto

819
00:34:43,608 --> 00:34:47,327
with commitments on animal
welfare and the environment.

820
00:34:47,327 --> 00:34:49,716
And so some of the highest animal welfare standards

821
00:34:49,716 --> 00:34:50,549
in the world.

822
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:53,418
Not only will we protect animal welfare standards.

823
00:34:53,418 --> 00:34:55,908
The UK has the highest animal welfare standards.

824
00:34:55,908 --> 00:34:57,708
And we are committing to maintaining

825
00:34:57,708 --> 00:34:59,898
our high standards on animal animal welfare.

826
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:03,408
We will be able to increase
our animal welfare standards.

827
00:35:03,408 --> 00:35:05,898
That will mean that Britain sets the gold standard

828
00:35:05,898 --> 00:35:09,018
for animal welfare and for
protection of animals overall.

829
00:35:09,018 --> 00:35:10,878
We will not compromise on animal welfare.

830
00:35:10,878 --> 00:35:15,048
That means that if anyone
abuses animals in their care

831
00:35:15,048 --> 00:35:16,908
or is cruel to another animal,

832
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:19,848
then they can face up to five years in jail.

833
00:35:19,848 --> 00:35:21,498
So the phrase the UK has some

834
00:35:21,498 --> 00:35:24,258
of the highest welfare standards in the world,

835
00:35:24,258 --> 00:35:25,398
it's something you'll hear a lot.

836
00:35:25,398 --> 00:35:27,338
And one of the biggest perpetrators

837
00:35:27,338 --> 00:35:29,358
of this propaganda from the industry

838
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:32,028
are a group called Red Tractor.

839
00:35:32,028 --> 00:35:33,888
[Narrator] So just by looking for the Red Tractor,

840
00:35:33,888 --> 00:35:36,168
you can see that it was
produced to British standards

841
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:37,488
and is British food.

842
00:35:37,488 --> 00:35:39,348
[Narrator 2] All Red Tractor animals are treated

843
00:35:39,348 --> 00:35:41,808
with compassion and have everything they need

844
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:43,098
for a good quality of life.

845
00:35:43,098 --> 00:35:43,931
[Narrator 3] For peace of mind

846
00:35:43,931 --> 00:35:45,460
about what goes on your table

847
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:49,638
when you shop, just look for the Red Tractor label.

848
00:35:49,638 --> 00:35:51,678
At this point, Red Tractor are a joke.

849
00:35:51,678 --> 00:35:54,198
They've been exposed that many times

850
00:35:54,198 --> 00:35:56,328
that I can't believe they still exist.

851
00:35:56,328 --> 00:35:58,608
But it's almost like they get exposed.

852
00:35:58,608 --> 00:35:59,778
They're all over the newspapers

853
00:35:59,778 --> 00:36:03,708
for being incredibly egregiously cruel to animals.

854
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:06,888
And Red Tractor put out some PR spiel going,

855
00:36:06,888 --> 00:36:08,958
oh, you know, we care about animal welfare,

856
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,538
we take it very seriously and then it just goes away

857
00:36:11,538 --> 00:36:12,678
and people forget about it.

858
00:36:12,678 --> 00:36:14,178
But at this point, Red Tractor

859
00:36:14,178 --> 00:36:17,793
are like a really low benchmark
for animal welfare actually.

860
00:36:20,452 --> 00:36:22,968
(crowd singing indistinctly)

861
00:36:22,968 --> 00:36:25,218
I believe this is the offices here.

862
00:36:25,218 --> 00:36:27,048
There's another one that says feeding ignorance,

863
00:36:27,048 --> 00:36:28,398
which is true.

864
00:36:28,398 --> 00:36:29,808
Red Tractor feed ignorance

865
00:36:29,808 --> 00:36:31,428
because no one ever looks into it.

866
00:36:31,428 --> 00:36:34,278
So many exposes of Red Tractor farms

867
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:37,398
have come from an organization called Viva!,

868
00:36:37,398 --> 00:36:39,798
founded by Juliet Gellatley.

869
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:42,288
My degree is in zoology.

870
00:36:42,288 --> 00:36:47,330
And I have been studying the
impacts of farming on animals

871
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,618
and the wider impacts for a few decades.

872
00:36:51,618 --> 00:36:55,548
Red Tractor is set up by farming groups.

873
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:58,518
Its guarantors are people
like the National Farmers Union,

874
00:36:58,518 --> 00:36:59,838
Dairy UK.

875
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:02,808
It is set up by farmers, for farmers.

876
00:37:02,808 --> 00:37:05,373
There is no independent scrutiny.

877
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:10,788
[Joey] Around 95% of UK pigs are Red Tractor assured

878
00:37:10,788 --> 00:37:12,888
In the industry, essentially, self-policing.

879
00:37:12,888 --> 00:37:14,688
You don't have a government oversight,

880
00:37:14,688 --> 00:37:17,718
you don't have any independent body going in there

881
00:37:17,718 --> 00:37:20,958
that is solely focused on the welfare of animals.

882
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:24,588
They are all schemes to
market products essentially.

883
00:37:24,588 --> 00:37:27,768
And pretty much every supermarket uses Red Tractor

884
00:37:27,768 --> 00:37:29,658
as a way of saying to the public,

885
00:37:29,658 --> 00:37:31,968
hey, this meat has come from an animal

886
00:37:31,968 --> 00:37:34,158
that's being kept in high-welfare conditions.

887
00:37:34,158 --> 00:37:34,991
And guess what?

888
00:37:34,991 --> 00:37:37,294
It's British so it must be good.

889
00:37:37,294 --> 00:37:38,127
(ominous music)

890
00:37:38,127 --> 00:37:43,169
They really need somebody who knows about pigs,

891
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,338
cares about welfare, isn't financially invested

892
00:37:46,338 --> 00:37:50,643
in any of it just to be rocking
up on farms without notice.

893
00:37:51,804 --> 00:37:54,471
(ominous music)

894
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,855
[Joey] Yeah.

895
00:37:56,855 --> 00:37:58,248
So I did some undercover work
during the making of the film

896
00:37:58,248 --> 00:38:00,978
and I've visited a Red Tractor-approved pig farm

897
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:02,133
multiple times.

898
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,748
From the farms that I've seen myself,

899
00:38:05,748 --> 00:38:07,068
which are many across the UK.

900
00:38:07,068 --> 00:38:07,998
Viva! must have filmed

901
00:38:07,998 --> 00:38:10,788
in maybe a hundred different pig farms.

902
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:14,688
The legal requirements for farmed animals in the UK

903
00:38:14,688 --> 00:38:16,503
is appallingly low.

904
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,318
Yeah, Phoenix the hedgehog.

905
00:38:18,318 --> 00:38:19,520
Copy that.

906
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,386
We're gonna make our way over now.

907
00:38:22,386 --> 00:38:25,398
(ominous music)

908
00:38:25,398 --> 00:38:28,398
I usually have a backup team with me just in case

909
00:38:28,398 --> 00:38:30,288
an irate farmer comes out with a shotgun

910
00:38:30,288 --> 00:38:33,288
'cause you never know when
you are actually trespassing

911
00:38:33,288 --> 00:38:34,173
on these farms.

912
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,823
Check this out, she's just given birth.

913
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,410
There's umbilical cord, dead
piglets after birth everywhere

914
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:48,408
and there's a piglet here having some type of seizure.

915
00:38:48,408 --> 00:38:51,888
It looks like the mother's
about to birth more piglets.

916
00:38:51,888 --> 00:38:56,930
These poor, poor, intelligent feeling beings.

917
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,868
What does it say about us as a species

918
00:38:59,868 --> 00:39:01,668
that we can do this to motherhood.

919
00:39:01,668 --> 00:39:05,293
It's supposed to be a time of celebration and joy.

920
00:39:05,293 --> 00:39:08,628
This is actually a dead piglet inside of a sack.

921
00:39:08,628 --> 00:39:12,078
Pigs that are pregnant I have seen in a sanctuary.

922
00:39:12,078 --> 00:39:12,978
And they go along

923
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:15,048
collecting all these different nesting materials

924
00:39:15,048 --> 00:39:17,058
and the other pigs in their family help them.

925
00:39:17,058 --> 00:39:21,303
You can sense that excitement
and that joy at the prospect.

926
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:25,908
And we've just degraded it into something

927
00:39:25,908 --> 00:39:29,208
that's there to make money for people.

928
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:30,228
[Joey] Look at her.

929
00:39:30,228 --> 00:39:32,928
They can never do their nesting behavior.

930
00:39:32,928 --> 00:39:35,688
They've got nothing to
actually build the materials with.

931
00:39:35,688 --> 00:39:39,798
And then they're giving birth into feces often.

932
00:39:39,798 --> 00:39:41,508
This little baby is still moving

933
00:39:41,508 --> 00:39:44,478
and her siblings that are stepping all over her.

934
00:39:44,478 --> 00:39:47,658
The bars prevent them from doing basic mothering

935
00:39:47,658 --> 00:39:49,128
to their own babies.

936
00:39:49,128 --> 00:39:51,738
And again and again, in pretty much every farm

937
00:39:51,738 --> 00:39:53,388
I've ever filmed in, you will see the dead

938
00:39:53,388 --> 00:39:55,188
left with the living.

939
00:39:55,188 --> 00:39:57,003
Poor darling, look.

940
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,203
They are shown no compassion.

941
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,578
They are left there to give birth all night.

942
00:40:04,578 --> 00:40:06,408
There was no carer there.

943
00:40:06,408 --> 00:40:09,318
I was in there for three hours and no one came.

944
00:40:09,318 --> 00:40:11,508
So these piglets are there suffering

945
00:40:11,508 --> 00:40:14,508
in this horrible factory farm.

946
00:40:14,508 --> 00:40:17,058
And then their babies are taken away at just three

947
00:40:17,058 --> 00:40:20,295
to four weeks old, where they're given nothing.

948
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:21,558
And I mean nothing.

949
00:40:21,558 --> 00:40:22,998
They never see sunshine,

950
00:40:22,998 --> 00:40:25,518
they never feel the rain on
their back, they never play.

951
00:40:25,518 --> 00:40:27,408
Play's really important to pigs.

952
00:40:27,408 --> 00:40:29,688
And they cannot develop normally without it.

953
00:40:29,688 --> 00:40:32,118
And so it develops aggression and lots of problems

954
00:40:32,118 --> 00:40:34,038
that go with that.

955
00:40:34,038 --> 00:40:36,787
And by six months old, they're sent to slaughter

956
00:40:36,787 --> 00:40:39,738
and that is all, that's what
the human race gives to them.

957
00:40:39,738 --> 00:40:41,538
[Joey] Around 11 million pigs are slaughtered

958
00:40:41,538 --> 00:40:43,458
in the UK each year.

959
00:40:43,458 --> 00:40:46,698
On top of that, if you work
back with the mortality rates,

960
00:40:46,698 --> 00:40:49,398
there will be 2 million pigs that don't make it

961
00:40:49,398 --> 00:40:53,418
from birth to slaughter at five or six months old.

962
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:56,628
And here's the last one, more after birth,

963
00:40:56,628 --> 00:41:01,248
piglets, suffered mother, abomination.

964
00:41:01,248 --> 00:41:02,508
And for the mothers themselves,

965
00:41:02,508 --> 00:41:06,498
imagine the psychological impact of repeatedly

966
00:41:06,498 --> 00:41:08,178
having your babies taken away.

967
00:41:08,178 --> 00:41:10,248
So remember, these are one
of the most intelligent animals

968
00:41:10,248 --> 00:41:11,118
on the planet.

969
00:41:11,118 --> 00:41:13,908
They know they're going
through the whole process again,

970
00:41:13,908 --> 00:41:15,798
and that they're gonna be put in a cage again,

971
00:41:15,798 --> 00:41:19,278
and they're gonna have their babies taken away again.

972
00:41:19,278 --> 00:41:21,948
And that is the repeated life

973
00:41:21,948 --> 00:41:24,438
of a factory-farmed mother pig.

974
00:41:24,438 --> 00:41:26,748
And is she rewarded at the end of it.

975
00:41:26,748 --> 00:41:27,581
No.

976
00:41:27,581 --> 00:41:29,118
When she gets to four to five years old,

977
00:41:29,118 --> 00:41:32,118
so the number of piglets she produces starts to fall,

978
00:41:32,118 --> 00:41:35,163
she's then slaughtered for cheap meat.

979
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:41,448
You look at the face of the
mothers and it is heartbreaking.

980
00:41:41,448 --> 00:41:45,918
We should be ashamed that we are still doing this,

981
00:41:45,918 --> 00:41:49,616
civilized society today that should know better.

982
00:41:49,616 --> 00:41:52,189
And this is the norm.

983
00:41:52,189 --> 00:41:53,833
My God.

984
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:54,666
Yeah.

985
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:55,499
So I went into another shed

986
00:41:55,499 --> 00:41:57,198
and the piglets were a little bit older,

987
00:41:57,198 --> 00:41:58,968
they were more like little toddlers at that stage,

988
00:41:58,968 --> 00:42:00,438
cute little puppy dogs.

989
00:42:00,438 --> 00:42:02,208
And I was looking down at their little beady eyes

990
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:04,953
looking up at me and they just looked so adorable.

991
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:10,188
And I just thought about the fate that awaited them

992
00:42:10,188 --> 00:42:13,038
and it started to make me feel really sick actually.

993
00:42:13,038 --> 00:42:15,513
So I had another plan.

994
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:21,348
Rescuing pigs isn't straightforward,

995
00:42:21,348 --> 00:42:23,913
their experiences with humans haven't been good.

996
00:42:25,285 --> 00:42:26,898
(somber music)

997
00:42:26,898 --> 00:42:30,093
I had to pick up a pig and the piglet was screaming.

998
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,139
It's okay.

999
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:41,181
So I had to comfort this
piglet and just like a little baby,

1000
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:44,283
they calmed down and then I put them in the bag.

1001
00:42:45,795 --> 00:42:48,378
(somber music)

1002
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:56,478
I didn't want to just rescue one pig

1003
00:42:56,478 --> 00:42:58,248
because they need a companion.

1004
00:42:58,248 --> 00:43:00,168
And I didn't want 'em to be scared or sad.

1005
00:43:00,168 --> 00:43:01,610
So I had to get another one.

1006
00:43:02,961 --> 00:43:04,758
(somber music)

1007
00:43:04,758 --> 00:43:07,038
Again, I reached down to grab another one

1008
00:43:07,038 --> 00:43:10,030
and had to calm the other one
down and put them in the bag.

1009
00:43:12,497 --> 00:43:15,618
(somber music)

1010
00:43:15,618 --> 00:43:18,948
But then what you notice is there's hundreds

1011
00:43:18,948 --> 00:43:20,148
of other piglets in there.

1012
00:43:20,148 --> 00:43:23,418
And the bittersweet part about rescuing animals

1013
00:43:23,418 --> 00:43:25,038
is you can't rescue them all.

1014
00:43:25,038 --> 00:43:30,080
So it's a reality check that most of those animals

1015
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:32,268
won't make it out alive

1016
00:43:32,268 --> 00:43:34,260
and they'll have to continue to suffer.

1017
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:39,182
(somber music)

1018
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,763
It's okay, babies, freedom.

1019
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,363
(somber music)

1020
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:00,023
Beautiful.

1021
00:44:02,121 --> 00:44:04,873
And they won't have to go to the gas chamber.

1022
00:44:04,873 --> 00:44:09,915
So two survivors.

1023
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:13,831
(somber music)

1024
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:18,828
So in the UK, there are charities set up specifically

1025
00:44:18,828 --> 00:44:20,778
to prevent cruelty to animals.

1026
00:44:20,778 --> 00:44:22,428
And why weren't more of 'em speaking out

1027
00:44:22,428 --> 00:44:25,728
against the use of CO2,
particularly the world's oldest

1028
00:44:25,728 --> 00:44:28,638
and largest animal welfare charity, the RSPCA,

1029
00:44:28,638 --> 00:44:32,328
the Royal Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

1030
00:44:32,328 --> 00:44:36,678
And they had Queen Elizabeth, as their patron.

1031
00:44:36,678 --> 00:44:39,498
Legislation will also be brought forward

1032
00:44:39,498 --> 00:44:42,948
to ensure the United Kingdom has and promotes

1033
00:44:42,948 --> 00:44:45,408
the highest standards of animal welfare.

1034
00:44:45,408 --> 00:44:47,658
The high-welfare rhetoric is so ingrained,

1035
00:44:47,658 --> 00:44:49,998
even the queen herself used it in parliament.

1036
00:44:49,998 --> 00:44:51,078
What's the RSPCA?

1037
00:44:51,078 --> 00:44:53,598
It's the Royal Society for the Protection of Animals.

1038
00:44:53,598 --> 00:44:55,518
Who are the RSPCA?

1039
00:44:55,518 --> 00:44:57,588
Are they like the police for animals or is that?

1040
00:44:57,588 --> 00:44:58,458
[Joey] Yeah, that's close.

1041
00:44:58,458 --> 00:44:59,970
That's close.

1042
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:00,803
Animal protection services.

1043
00:45:00,803 --> 00:45:02,088
Yeah, go on.

1044
00:45:02,088 --> 00:45:02,921
Okay.

1045
00:45:02,921 --> 00:45:05,778
The RSPCA is set up to protect animals,

1046
00:45:05,778 --> 00:45:08,432
to prevent cruelty to animals.

1047
00:45:08,432 --> 00:45:11,058
♪ Love, sweet love. ♪

1048
00:45:11,058 --> 00:45:12,798
And when people think of the RSPCA,

1049
00:45:12,798 --> 00:45:14,838
they think, oh, they look after dogs and cats.

1050
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:16,275
They rescue dogs and cats,

1051
00:45:16,275 --> 00:45:19,248
and you might see them
looking after a starving horse.

1052
00:45:19,248 --> 00:45:20,298
So when they think of the RSPCA, they think,

1053
00:45:20,298 --> 00:45:22,548
oh, well they take care of animals.

1054
00:45:22,548 --> 00:45:24,288
Specific animals.

1055
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:26,658
Do you know much about the RSPCA?

1056
00:45:26,658 --> 00:45:30,148
Quite a bit because I do support them.

1057
00:45:30,148 --> 00:45:31,878
I do send them money.

1058
00:45:31,878 --> 00:45:32,711
[Joey] Send them money?

1059
00:45:32,711 --> 00:45:35,598
Because they do, I think they do a brilliant job

1060
00:45:35,598 --> 00:45:38,178
with lost animals and animals

1061
00:45:38,178 --> 00:45:40,141
that haven't been very well treated.

1062
00:45:40,141 --> 00:45:42,678
Yeah, like dogs, and cats, and horses.

1063
00:45:42,678 --> 00:45:43,931
Yeah, any.

1064
00:45:43,931 --> 00:45:44,764
Our cats came from them.

1065
00:45:44,764 --> 00:45:45,597
Oh really?

1066
00:45:45,597 --> 00:45:46,818
When their name goes on something,

1067
00:45:46,818 --> 00:45:49,668
there's an automatic assumption

1068
00:45:49,668 --> 00:45:52,548
that it's high-welfare in some kind of way.

1069
00:45:52,548 --> 00:45:55,098
And so they're manipulating the public's perception

1070
00:45:55,098 --> 00:45:57,198
of what it is that they're buying.

1071
00:45:57,198 --> 00:46:00,138
Outdoor bred pork RSPCA Assured.

1072
00:46:00,138 --> 00:46:03,093
More pork, RSPCA Assured.

1073
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:05,898
RSPCA Assured.

1074
00:46:05,898 --> 00:46:06,731
And what would it tell you?

1075
00:46:06,731 --> 00:46:07,564
What would the logo tell you?

1076
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:09,048
I just hope that it would mean

1077
00:46:09,048 --> 00:46:12,018
that the animal has been
treated in a better condition,

1078
00:46:12,018 --> 00:46:14,523
had a better life in comparison to the other option.

1079
00:46:14,523 --> 00:46:15,356
Okay.

1080
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:17,179
Well, you'd think that the animals

1081
00:46:17,179 --> 00:46:18,726
have been better looked after.

1082
00:46:18,726 --> 00:46:20,177
They've not been mistreated,

1083
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:21,532
they've not been cruelly treated.

1084
00:46:21,532 --> 00:46:22,365
[Joey] Okay.

1085
00:46:22,365 --> 00:46:23,198
I don't know.

1086
00:46:23,198 --> 00:46:25,155
'Cause RSPPCA are people that protect animals,

1087
00:46:25,155 --> 00:46:28,158
but if that was on, if it was on the meat

1088
00:46:28,158 --> 00:46:29,598
then how's that fair?

1089
00:46:29,598 --> 00:46:31,248
'Cause you're killing that animal then.

1090
00:46:31,248 --> 00:46:33,198
Well, that's taking an animal's life, innit?

1091
00:46:33,198 --> 00:46:34,590
Oh, that's made me think a little bit.

1092
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:35,423
Okay, go on.

1093
00:46:35,423 --> 00:46:36,256
Okay.

1094
00:46:36,256 --> 00:46:38,088
No, well, I'm not even trying here, you're going there.

1095
00:46:38,088 --> 00:46:41,568
So when it comes to discriminating between species

1096
00:46:41,568 --> 00:46:44,898
of animals, like a dog should be valued

1097
00:46:44,898 --> 00:46:47,208
and the pig should be on a plate.

1098
00:46:47,208 --> 00:46:49,668
The RSPCA are a big culprit here.

1099
00:46:49,668 --> 00:46:52,038
They sort of perpetuate
how you treat a dog differently

1100
00:46:52,038 --> 00:46:52,871
as you treat a pig.

1101
00:46:52,871 --> 00:46:54,439
Why wouldn't you eat the dog meat?

1102
00:46:54,439 --> 00:46:55,272
Tell me.

1103
00:46:55,272 --> 00:46:56,568
Because I've never had a dog.

1104
00:46:56,568 --> 00:46:57,528
But I really like dogs.

1105
00:46:57,528 --> 00:47:00,678
I'm sure if I'd spent loads of time with pigs in my life

1106
00:47:00,678 --> 00:47:02,207
and I knew loads of people with pet pigs

1107
00:47:02,207 --> 00:47:03,228
that I thought were really cute,

1108
00:47:03,228 --> 00:47:06,213
then I'd have more of a thing against eating pigs.

1109
00:47:07,956 --> 00:47:11,388
(ominous music)

1110
00:47:11,388 --> 00:47:13,458
So the closest most people come to pigs

1111
00:47:13,458 --> 00:47:15,798
is when they see them in the supermarket chopped up

1112
00:47:15,798 --> 00:47:18,138
and wrapped in cellophane on the shelf.

1113
00:47:18,138 --> 00:47:19,878
Most people haven't gone to a sanctuary

1114
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:21,258
and connected with a pig.

1115
00:47:21,258 --> 00:47:23,178
Most people have never been inside a factory farm

1116
00:47:23,178 --> 00:47:25,308
and connected with a pig or connected with a pig

1117
00:47:25,308 --> 00:47:27,438
on a truck outside of a slaughterhouse.

1118
00:47:27,438 --> 00:47:30,768
So if that's the closest people have come to pigs,

1119
00:47:30,768 --> 00:47:33,768
you can see how they'd have this level of disconnect

1120
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:37,998
and how they would just see pigs as food.

1121
00:47:37,998 --> 00:47:40,278
They all have different expressions.

1122
00:47:40,278 --> 00:47:42,918
Some are more scared than the others,

1123
00:47:42,918 --> 00:47:47,868
some are more curious, some
just look tired and relaxed.

1124
00:47:47,868 --> 00:47:51,618
Others just look terrified and worried.

1125
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:54,528
They all have different faces and personalities.

1126
00:47:54,528 --> 00:47:56,538
For me and another activist
who have been out the front

1127
00:47:56,538 --> 00:47:59,388
of slaughterhouses looking
into the eyes of these animals

1128
00:47:59,388 --> 00:48:01,848
who have been inside farms
and witnessing their suffering

1129
00:48:01,848 --> 00:48:04,938
and been on sanctuaries and seeing their behavior,

1130
00:48:04,938 --> 00:48:07,398
and how playful and curious they are, just like dogs.

1131
00:48:07,398 --> 00:48:08,418
It's impossible for us

1132
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:11,193
to see these sentient conscious creatures as food.

1133
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,505
We are born into this world

1134
00:48:20,505 --> 00:48:22,068
and we learn everything about the world.

1135
00:48:22,068 --> 00:48:25,158
We learn about plants, and about colors,

1136
00:48:25,158 --> 00:48:27,498
and about the way the world works,

1137
00:48:27,498 --> 00:48:30,048
and we learn about animals too.

1138
00:48:30,048 --> 00:48:32,568
But as children, we really care about all animals.

1139
00:48:32,568 --> 00:48:34,788
But we're always taught that the dogs and cats at home

1140
00:48:34,788 --> 00:48:37,668
are to be loved, and cared for, and cherished.

1141
00:48:37,668 --> 00:48:39,858
But the pigs, and the cows, and the chickens

1142
00:48:39,858 --> 00:48:41,718
are to be chopped up and put on our plate.

1143
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:43,488
'Cause when they look down
at their plate, what do they see?

1144
00:48:43,488 --> 00:48:48,138
They see chicken or they see
a fish finger or they see ham

1145
00:48:48,138 --> 00:48:51,768
and there might be a picture
of a pig on that packet of ham.

1146
00:48:51,768 --> 00:48:56,418
And as we grow up, society confirms that to us,

1147
00:48:56,418 --> 00:48:59,587
advertising we see fish fingers, and burgers,

1148
00:48:59,587 --> 00:49:03,348
and they are discriminating between these animals

1149
00:49:03,348 --> 00:49:04,698
based on species.

1150
00:49:04,698 --> 00:49:07,728
And these aren't morally relevant differences.

1151
00:49:07,728 --> 00:49:11,178
What's morally relevant are
the fact that both these animals

1152
00:49:11,178 --> 00:49:14,718
are conscious beings who don't want to die.

1153
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:17,538
That's why they both deserve equal treatment.

1154
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:19,330
But that's not the case in society.

1155
00:49:23,102 --> 00:49:24,708
(gentle music)

1156
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:28,398
Pigs are naturally very inquisitive animals

1157
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:31,818
and I mean they're incredibly intelligent animals

1158
00:49:31,818 --> 00:49:35,658
and they can see what's happening, smell, feel.

1159
00:49:35,658 --> 00:49:40,248
They are very social and they are easy to train.

1160
00:49:40,248 --> 00:49:42,138
Exactly the same as dogs.

1161
00:49:42,138 --> 00:49:45,378
There's a lot of evidence
for how complex the behavior

1162
00:49:45,378 --> 00:49:47,388
and the learning ability of pigs is.

1163
00:49:47,388 --> 00:49:51,048
And one of the things which we did was to see

1164
00:49:51,048 --> 00:49:54,018
whether they could learn what you see in a mirror

1165
00:49:54,018 --> 00:49:56,898
and they learn what is in a mirror is over here

1166
00:49:56,898 --> 00:49:58,068
and not over there.

1167
00:49:58,068 --> 00:50:00,168
And they use the information

1168
00:50:00,168 --> 00:50:02,538
and in fact, there's only a limited number of animals

1169
00:50:02,538 --> 00:50:04,548
where that has been demonstrated.

1170
00:50:04,548 --> 00:50:06,744
[Narrator 4] This is hamlet.

1171
00:50:06,744 --> 00:50:08,388
(playful music)

1172
00:50:08,388 --> 00:50:10,638
He's amazed animal psychologists,

1173
00:50:10,638 --> 00:50:14,328
by learning a computer game
designed for chimpanzees,

1174
00:50:14,328 --> 00:50:17,148
Hamlet has to move the cursor into the blue area

1175
00:50:17,148 --> 00:50:18,738
around the screen.

1176
00:50:18,738 --> 00:50:21,318
When he does, he gets a sweet.

1177
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:24,618
The scientists make it
progressively harder for Hamlet,

1178
00:50:24,618 --> 00:50:26,122
yet he succeeds every time.

1179
00:50:26,122 --> 00:50:27,138
[Scientist] Oh, good boy, that was good.

1180
00:50:27,138 --> 00:50:31,608
Pigs have been shown in
studies to have the intelligence,

1181
00:50:31,608 --> 00:50:35,508
the cognitive capacity of a 4-year-old human.

1182
00:50:35,508 --> 00:50:38,358
They outstrip dogs in a lot of tests.

1183
00:50:38,358 --> 00:50:41,598
We've seen pigs painting pictures on the internet

1184
00:50:41,598 --> 00:50:44,868
and doing puzzles that you would expect a child

1185
00:50:44,868 --> 00:50:47,898
to struggle with and they're doing it with ease.

1186
00:50:47,898 --> 00:50:49,878
You can train them to do a lot of things

1187
00:50:49,878 --> 00:50:51,558
at least as well as dogs can.

1188
00:50:51,558 --> 00:50:53,688
I'm doing a PhD here at the department

1189
00:50:53,688 --> 00:50:57,078
and specifically, we compare how dogs and pigs

1190
00:50:57,078 --> 00:50:58,668
communicate with humans.

1191
00:50:58,668 --> 00:50:59,808
And you might think why pigs,

1192
00:50:59,808 --> 00:51:01,878
they are like super different from dogs.

1193
00:51:01,878 --> 00:51:06,588
But interestingly, they shared
common things with dogs

1194
00:51:06,588 --> 00:51:10,083
that make them perfect
for our comparative research.

1195
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,958
What was very surprising for me, first of all,

1196
00:51:14,958 --> 00:51:19,008
is to discover that they can
really adapt to a human family.

1197
00:51:19,008 --> 00:51:21,588
There is a tendency for people, for humans

1198
00:51:21,588 --> 00:51:23,838
to act as though no other species

1199
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:25,338
has any significant ability

1200
00:51:25,338 --> 00:51:26,988
and that humans are enormously different.

1201
00:51:26,988 --> 00:51:30,018
But actually the more you look at other species,

1202
00:51:30,018 --> 00:51:32,448
you find that the similarities are far greater

1203
00:51:32,448 --> 00:51:33,948
than the differences.

1204
00:51:33,948 --> 00:51:36,318
And all the animals we keep as farm animals

1205
00:51:36,318 --> 00:51:40,278
or pets are really quite sophisticated.

1206
00:51:40,278 --> 00:51:43,518
So once people understand
how smart pigs actually are,

1207
00:51:43,518 --> 00:51:46,158
they'll then begin to understand how aware they are

1208
00:51:46,158 --> 00:51:48,798
of when something bad is going to happen to them.

1209
00:51:48,798 --> 00:51:51,678
You look at them in a slaughterhouse situation,

1210
00:51:51,678 --> 00:51:53,268
they experience emotional contagion

1211
00:51:53,268 --> 00:51:55,128
so they can empathize with those around them.

1212
00:51:55,128 --> 00:51:59,388
So hearing those sounds,
smelling what they're smelling,

1213
00:51:59,388 --> 00:52:04,008
and the fact that they are
aware enough to kind of process

1214
00:52:04,008 --> 00:52:06,708
what might be happening there is really,

1215
00:52:06,708 --> 00:52:08,300
it's an awful thought, I think.

1216
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,388
If I'm gonna sell you something, right,

1217
00:52:14,388 --> 00:52:16,008
and you'd feel guilty if you knew,

1218
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:19,016
what would I say to you to make you buy it?

1219
00:52:19,016 --> 00:52:21,318
Stick a free-range label on there,

1220
00:52:21,318 --> 00:52:25,548
that probably would help the
consumer willingness to pay

1221
00:52:25,548 --> 00:52:27,978
and willingness to continue buying that product.

1222
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,208
[Joey] If you like seeing some meat

1223
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:31,878
and one said British-made bacon

1224
00:52:31,878 --> 00:52:34,518
and one said free-range, what would you choose?

1225
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:35,351
Free-range.

1226
00:52:35,351 --> 00:52:36,184
Yeah, same.

1227
00:52:36,184 --> 00:52:40,308
I would feel probably
better about a free-range label.

1228
00:52:40,308 --> 00:52:42,168
Free-range kind of gives me the idea that, yeah,

1229
00:52:42,168 --> 00:52:44,538
they've got more space to roam around.

1230
00:52:44,538 --> 00:52:47,208
A little bit more like open pasture,

1231
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:49,810
a little bit more quality of life

1232
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:52,698
before they get turned into bacon.

1233
00:52:52,698 --> 00:52:55,758
Companies tell us that it's all hunky dory

1234
00:52:55,758 --> 00:52:56,988
and everything's fine,

1235
00:52:56,988 --> 00:52:58,068
easily, they could be lying to us

1236
00:52:58,068 --> 00:53:00,048
and we could just eat it up.

1237
00:53:00,048 --> 00:53:03,288
The public perception of a free-range farm

1238
00:53:03,288 --> 00:53:04,968
would be what you see on the labels.

1239
00:53:04,968 --> 00:53:09,768
So a big stretch of field, lovely grass or plants

1240
00:53:09,768 --> 00:53:12,610
with all these little pigs
running around quite happily.

1241
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,675
I decided to go check out a free-range farm.

1242
00:53:15,675 --> 00:53:16,938
I'd never been to one before

1243
00:53:16,938 --> 00:53:20,208
and I wanted to go see for myself what it was like.

1244
00:53:20,208 --> 00:53:24,408
Approaching this free-range farm, it was idyllic.

1245
00:53:24,408 --> 00:53:26,328
The hills were rolling in green,

1246
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:29,448
and you could see pigs from the highway playing,

1247
00:53:29,448 --> 00:53:30,858
and they had a lot more room.

1248
00:53:30,858 --> 00:53:35,853
It was a stark contrast from
the factory farms I'd been to.

1249
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:40,533
So basically, we kept driving
till we found an entrance.

1250
00:53:42,582 --> 00:53:45,165
(gentle music)

1251
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:50,298
As we walked up.

1252
00:53:50,298 --> 00:53:53,718
I did not expect to see what we witnessed.

1253
00:53:53,718 --> 00:53:55,316
Oh god.

1254
00:53:55,316 --> 00:53:57,289
(ominous music)

1255
00:53:57,289 --> 00:54:00,578
Oh no, oh God.

1256
00:54:00,578 --> 00:54:02,271
(ominous music)

1257
00:54:02,271 --> 00:54:03,783
It's okay, sweetie.

1258
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:06,723
She's cold and scared.

1259
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:10,818
It's okay, darling.

1260
00:54:10,818 --> 00:54:13,323
This is absolutely shocking and sickening.

1261
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:18,633
How long has this pig been here like this for?

1262
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:23,148
This is gross animal neglect.

1263
00:54:23,148 --> 00:54:25,803
This is sickening animal cruelty.

1264
00:54:28,118 --> 00:54:28,951
It's okay.

1265
00:54:30,292 --> 00:54:32,875
(somber music)

1266
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:36,360
[Tarion] Oh my god.

1267
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:38,373
It stinks man.

1268
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:44,510
This smells like dead bodies and rotten feces.

1269
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,540
It's really, it's horrible here.

1270
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:51,708
[Tarion] Oh my God.

1271
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:52,623
The diarrhea.

1272
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:56,193
Just diarrhea just squirting out.

1273
00:54:57,409 --> 00:54:59,992
(somber music)

1274
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:03,170
Yeah, they've all got these hernias, man, hey.

1275
00:55:04,984 --> 00:55:07,567
(somber music)

1276
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:13,698
She's got blood all over her.

1277
00:55:13,698 --> 00:55:16,068
It looks like there's blood here.

1278
00:55:16,068 --> 00:55:17,760
There's blood on this pig's face.

1279
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,698
I felt helpless there.

1280
00:55:22,698 --> 00:55:25,368
To think that anyone could leave

1281
00:55:25,368 --> 00:55:26,868
animals suffering like that.

1282
00:55:26,868 --> 00:55:30,828
And you think like, what have
they done to deserve that?

1283
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:32,778
I've seen all of that before.

1284
00:55:32,778 --> 00:55:36,858
All the different manifestations
of sick and dying pigs.

1285
00:55:36,858 --> 00:55:39,392
Incredibly common to see that.

1286
00:55:39,392 --> 00:55:41,448
The stench, pigs are coughing.

1287
00:55:41,448 --> 00:55:43,128
They've got like pneumonia or something.

1288
00:55:43,128 --> 00:55:44,270
They look really sick.

1289
00:55:45,645 --> 00:55:48,738
(somber music)

1290
00:55:48,738 --> 00:55:50,193
This baby is really sick.

1291
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,780
She's gasping and she's struggling to breathe.

1292
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:55,853
It's okay.

1293
00:55:57,095 --> 00:55:58,045
It's okay, sweetie.

1294
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:00,533
I know.

1295
00:56:01,631 --> 00:56:03,273
They were coughing and wheezing.

1296
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:07,983
It was just heartbreaking these little pigs.

1297
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:10,878
Little family being very protective

1298
00:56:10,878 --> 00:56:13,233
over this little sick piglet here,

1299
00:56:14,242 --> 00:56:15,753
you can see she's suffering.

1300
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,823
(somber music)

1301
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,158
I think the RSPCA sold out years ago

1302
00:56:25,158 --> 00:56:26,838
where farmed animals are concerned.

1303
00:56:26,838 --> 00:56:29,178
They're not even taking court prosecutions now

1304
00:56:29,178 --> 00:56:30,011
for farmed animals.

1305
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:32,088
They pass it on to trading standards.

1306
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:35,508
The RSPCA do very little to protect farmed animals,

1307
00:56:35,508 --> 00:56:37,938
which is staggering really.

1308
00:56:37,938 --> 00:56:40,998
We see ourselves as a nation of animal lovers

1309
00:56:40,998 --> 00:56:44,388
and yet the animals that we abuse by far the most

1310
00:56:44,388 --> 00:56:46,398
have almost no protection.

1311
00:56:46,398 --> 00:56:48,138
There's about five or six animals here

1312
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:50,318
that desperately need help right now.

1313
00:56:50,318 --> 00:56:53,081
[Tarion] There's so many.

1314
00:56:53,081 --> 00:56:55,706
(somber music)

1315
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:00,840
If there's a dead bin here,

1316
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,723
they're doing the killing from down here.

1317
00:57:05,122 --> 00:57:07,705
(somber music)

1318
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:20,928
[Tarion] Jesus Christ.

1319
00:57:20,928 --> 00:57:23,838
After witnessing what we saw on this farm,

1320
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:27,348
we decided to launch a
full-scale investigation there.

1321
00:57:27,348 --> 00:57:31,533
So we also visited other sites connected to the farm.

1322
00:57:34,205 --> 00:57:34,996
[Tarion] Oh my God.

1323
00:57:34,996 --> 00:57:36,833
[Joey] Oh my God, that's all foaming and worse.

1324
00:57:38,366 --> 00:57:40,364
This is absolutely sickening.

1325
00:57:40,364 --> 00:57:41,435
[Tarion] Oh God.

1326
00:57:41,435 --> 00:57:42,268
Oh God.

1327
00:57:42,268 --> 00:57:45,378
It's the cheapest way to deal with animals

1328
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:48,408
that are not economically viable.

1329
00:57:48,408 --> 00:57:49,700
That is absolutely gross.

1330
00:57:51,083 --> 00:57:52,908
(ominous music)

1331
00:57:52,908 --> 00:57:53,823
That was sick.

1332
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,608
So about 15 minutes into our first visit,

1333
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:01,293
we did set up surveillance cameras.

1334
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:06,258
Blunt force trauma up until
very recently used to be legal

1335
00:58:06,258 --> 00:58:08,478
for piglets under 10 kilos.

1336
00:58:08,478 --> 00:58:12,048
So swinging them by the back
legs and smashing the skull,

1337
00:58:12,048 --> 00:58:15,348
you now have to use an instrument for any pig

1338
00:58:15,348 --> 00:58:17,808
over four weeks old or over 10 kilos,

1339
00:58:17,808 --> 00:58:21,858
you have to use a bolt gun is the most common thing,

1340
00:58:21,858 --> 00:58:26,268
so penetrative, because they have very tough skulls.

1341
00:58:26,268 --> 00:58:29,688
Yeah, it's not acceptable to
use blunt force trauma at all.

1342
00:58:29,688 --> 00:58:32,828
Particularly a pig over 10 kilos,

1343
00:58:32,828 --> 00:58:35,193
it's never been acceptable.

1344
00:58:44,218 --> 00:58:48,348
Okay, so we left the camera pointing at this animal

1345
00:58:48,348 --> 00:58:49,248
who was paralyzed.

1346
00:58:49,248 --> 00:58:50,081
We've got a worker on site.

1347
00:58:50,081 --> 00:58:52,146
It is 7:26.

1348
00:58:52,146 --> 00:58:53,862
(ominous music)

1349
00:58:53,862 --> 00:58:56,750
(pig screaming)

1350
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:58,621
He's got a metal bar.

1351
00:58:58,621 --> 00:59:01,617
(pig screaming)

1352
00:59:01,617 --> 00:59:04,326
(ominous music)

1353
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,570
He's still going.

1354
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:14,820
He's hurt his leg.

1355
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:17,973
We have got you, you scumbag.

1356
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:22,338
Instead of getting vet care for this animal,

1357
00:59:22,338 --> 00:59:23,898
they've grabbed an iron bar

1358
00:59:23,898 --> 00:59:26,148
and bludgeoned this animal in their head.

1359
00:59:26,148 --> 00:59:27,363
How shocking.

1360
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:30,798
It was pretty logical to assume

1361
00:59:30,798 --> 00:59:33,670
they've all been beaten to death

1362
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,650
because they were suffering and sick.

1363
00:59:37,541 --> 00:59:42,541
There's no mercy, no help, no vet care, just an iron bar.

1364
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:48,138
Ruthless, savage, sickening.

1365
00:59:48,138 --> 00:59:51,588
No wonder those pigs were
so protective of each other.

1366
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,348
No wonder they were trying
to protect each other from,

1367
00:59:54,348 --> 00:59:56,513
they thought that we might do the same thing.

1368
00:59:58,410 --> 01:00:00,078
They're very smart animals, pigs,

1369
01:00:00,078 --> 01:00:01,218
they're very smart animals.

1370
01:00:01,218 --> 01:00:03,303
And here he comes again.

1371
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:16,668
Wow.

1372
01:00:16,668 --> 01:00:17,543
What a monster.

1373
01:00:20,047 --> 01:00:21,408
No help for this animal.

1374
01:00:21,408 --> 01:00:23,313
Just a bar to death.

1375
01:00:24,747 --> 01:00:28,164
(tractor engine humming)

1376
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:33,603
Absolutely shocking.

1377
01:00:34,817 --> 01:00:38,234
(tractor engine humming)

1378
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:42,933
Absolutely just.

1379
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:48,798
But one of the most shocking things about it all

1380
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:50,328
was that the owner of this farm

1381
01:00:50,328 --> 01:00:52,038
was named Farmer of the Year.

1382
01:00:52,038 --> 01:00:54,018
His photos have appeared across media outlets

1383
01:00:54,018 --> 01:00:56,328
where he and his company have been celebrated

1384
01:00:56,328 --> 01:01:00,348
for receiving various awards,
including one from the RSPCA.

1385
01:01:00,348 --> 01:01:02,808
But if this is an award-winning company,

1386
01:01:02,808 --> 01:01:04,878
I wonder what the ones that don't get awards look like.

1387
01:01:04,878 --> 01:01:09,498
The free-range label doesn't have a legal definition.

1388
01:01:09,498 --> 01:01:12,888
So there's not very much
transparency with the public

1389
01:01:12,888 --> 01:01:15,318
is what I'd say in terms of labeling.

1390
01:01:15,318 --> 01:01:18,618
It's not that clear what you're actually getting.

1391
01:01:18,618 --> 01:01:20,568
We later found out that this site is connected

1392
01:01:20,568 --> 01:01:24,378
to multiple major pig
producers, including Pilgrim's UK.

1393
01:01:24,378 --> 01:01:25,608
And that the pigs raised there

1394
01:01:25,608 --> 01:01:27,900
are actually destined for their gas chambers.

1395
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:33,228
(suspenseful music)

1396
01:01:39,875 --> 01:01:41,118
So at about 2:00 AM, me and Dan

1397
01:01:41,118 --> 01:01:43,128
dressed as maintenance contract workers,

1398
01:01:43,128 --> 01:01:46,593
made our way around the back of the slaughterhouse.

1399
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:49,900
Like we're actually doing this now.

1400
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:53,988
We had ladders and a big bag of equipment,

1401
01:01:53,988 --> 01:01:56,348
oxygen tank, harnesses, everything.

1402
01:01:56,348 --> 01:01:57,303
It was heavy.

1403
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:03,858
[Dan] We got us on the fire escape and that was part one.

1404
01:02:03,858 --> 01:02:07,863
And we start walking now
in the slaughterhouse grounds.

1405
01:02:09,048 --> 01:02:12,738
(suspenseful music)

1406
01:02:12,738 --> 01:02:14,718
[Dan] That was where everything could go wrong

1407
01:02:14,718 --> 01:02:17,448
from that point onward, if we got pulled by anybody,

1408
01:02:17,448 --> 01:02:20,013
anybody saw us, people could recognize me.

1409
01:02:21,732 --> 01:02:24,738
(suspenseful music)

1410
01:02:24,738 --> 01:02:27,528
So we get into the door, and there's a washroom,

1411
01:02:27,528 --> 01:02:28,983
and the taps are running.

1412
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:31,758
(suspenseful music)

1413
01:02:31,758 --> 01:02:33,678
I said, Joe, they're automatic taps,

1414
01:02:33,678 --> 01:02:35,538
as soon as anybody walks in front of these taps,

1415
01:02:35,538 --> 01:02:36,678
these taps come on.

1416
01:02:36,678 --> 01:02:38,178
So we're freaking out a little bit

1417
01:02:38,178 --> 01:02:41,358
because if we'd been a few minutes earlier,

1418
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:43,850
we would've run straight into one of the workers.

1419
01:02:45,852 --> 01:02:48,852
(suspenseful music)

1420
01:02:50,211 --> 01:02:52,608
And then we had the plastic see-through curtains

1421
01:02:52,608 --> 01:02:56,193
and that was the final little
bit before the gas chamber.

1422
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:00,050
So I put my head through there, there was nobody there.

1423
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:08,090
Straight through, right on,
right again to the gas chamber.

1424
01:03:08,884 --> 01:03:11,884
(suspenseful music)

1425
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:15,588
We get to the gas chamber and I'm just like, thank God.

1426
01:03:15,588 --> 01:03:18,978
Because once we get to that gas chamber,

1427
01:03:18,978 --> 01:03:21,498
we're kind of half safe from getting caught.

1428
01:03:21,498 --> 01:03:26,028
We can climb up on the top of it and keep our heads down.

1429
01:03:26,028 --> 01:03:29,133
Just hope to God no one sees us on top of that thing.

1430
01:03:30,855 --> 01:03:32,805
(suspenseful music)

1431
01:03:32,805 --> 01:03:35,897
[Dan] Gets on top, lifts the lid and that was it.

1432
01:03:42,336 --> 01:03:44,598
You could see right into the gas chamber.

1433
01:03:44,598 --> 01:03:46,428
This is the thing, right?

1434
01:03:46,428 --> 01:03:48,738
No one had stepped onto that cage yet.

1435
01:03:48,738 --> 01:03:51,438
I didn't know whether, if I stepped onto that cage

1436
01:03:51,438 --> 01:03:54,138
it was just gonna start moving
and drop me straight down

1437
01:03:54,138 --> 01:03:55,068
to the bottom.

1438
01:03:55,068 --> 01:03:57,310
I didn't know whether the gas was invisible.

1439
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:02,303
I didn't know if I was gonna
start getting dizzy in there.

1440
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:07,128
My main concern was once Joe stepped on that

1441
01:04:07,128 --> 01:04:09,933
to be ready to grab him, if it started moving.

1442
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:14,853
But I stepped onto the cage, it didn't move.

1443
01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:18,108
Took a breath in of air and I was also relieved

1444
01:04:18,108 --> 01:04:20,898
that there wasn't, from what I could feel,

1445
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:22,263
much gas in the chamber.

1446
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:24,768
(suspenseful music)

1447
01:04:24,768 --> 01:04:27,078
My heart is like rushing.

1448
01:04:27,078 --> 01:04:28,278
And I had to focus

1449
01:04:28,278 --> 01:04:31,458
because I had to start connecting secret cameras

1450
01:04:31,458 --> 01:04:33,188
to the cages.

1451
01:04:33,188 --> 01:04:34,638
(suspenseful music)

1452
01:04:34,638 --> 01:04:37,668
First of all, I needed to fix a camera to the top part

1453
01:04:37,668 --> 01:04:40,308
of the cage, pointing in.

1454
01:04:40,308 --> 01:04:41,808
To me that was the most important view.

1455
01:04:41,808 --> 01:04:43,638
'cause we wanted to see what happened to the pigs

1456
01:04:43,638 --> 01:04:45,230
as they went down into the gas.

1457
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:49,938
And I set another one up pointing into the front

1458
01:04:49,938 --> 01:04:51,480
of the other side of the cage.

1459
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:56,748
These cages rotate, so it's like Russian roulette.

1460
01:04:56,748 --> 01:05:01,008
So in order for me to quickly
know where the cages were

1461
01:05:01,008 --> 01:05:03,288
that had the cameras on them I used the white marker

1462
01:05:03,288 --> 01:05:05,043
and marked the top of the cages.

1463
01:05:06,418 --> 01:05:07,668
(suspenseful music)

1464
01:05:07,668 --> 01:05:11,178
And then I wanted to set one up

1465
01:05:11,178 --> 01:05:13,758
underneath one of the gondolas, the big cages,

1466
01:05:13,758 --> 01:05:18,800
so that it would follow the
cage below it and film the pigs.

1467
01:05:19,312 --> 01:05:22,848
(suspenseful music)

1468
01:05:22,848 --> 01:05:26,328
And then I thought, what if someone switches it on?

1469
01:05:26,328 --> 01:05:31,370
I'm sat on this cage with
machinery, and cogs, and chains.

1470
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,198
Joel's lied on this grill

1471
01:05:33,198 --> 01:05:36,708
with his arm underneath one of these cages.

1472
01:05:36,708 --> 01:05:39,318
If this started, Joe would get his arm ripped off,

1473
01:05:39,318 --> 01:05:41,658
I'd get crushed into the ceiling.

1474
01:05:41,658 --> 01:05:42,948
So that's it.

1475
01:05:42,948 --> 01:05:44,448
Heart's going, I'm worrying.

1476
01:05:44,448 --> 01:05:46,083
I'm stressed, I'm listening.

1477
01:05:47,245 --> 01:05:50,208
(suspenseful music)

1478
01:05:50,208 --> 01:05:51,693
I then all of a sudden.

1479
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:54,138
(machine whirring)

1480
01:05:54,138 --> 01:05:54,971
Super loud.

1481
01:05:54,971 --> 01:05:57,223
I'm just like, I look up at Dan like,

1482
01:05:58,110 --> 01:05:59,838
they just turned that gas chamber on?

1483
01:05:59,838 --> 01:06:01,398
What is that?

1484
01:06:01,398 --> 01:06:02,928
Dan's freaking out.

1485
01:06:02,928 --> 01:06:05,028
I was just waiting for things to start turning.

1486
01:06:05,028 --> 01:06:06,420
There's nothing I could do.

1487
01:06:07,770 --> 01:06:08,568
Started again.

1488
01:06:08,568 --> 01:06:10,710
Joel starts getting the camera, put it on.

1489
01:06:11,692 --> 01:06:14,688
(machine whirring)

1490
01:06:14,688 --> 01:06:16,954
Three times that happened.

1491
01:06:16,954 --> 01:06:17,787
(suspenseful music)

1492
01:06:17,787 --> 01:06:18,828
[Joey] So my heart's pounding.

1493
01:06:18,828 --> 01:06:22,703
My body was saying, get the hell out of here.

1494
01:06:22,703 --> 01:06:24,649
Don't think I'm gonna be able to reach that man, eh?

1495
01:06:24,649 --> 01:06:26,508
Yeah, but my mind was saying, stay,

1496
01:06:26,508 --> 01:06:28,150
you have to finish this mission.

1497
01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:31,638
So I just pushed the fear in the back of my mind

1498
01:06:31,638 --> 01:06:33,180
and just kept placing cameras.

1499
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:37,436
(machine whirring)

1500
01:06:37,436 --> 01:06:40,478
(suspenseful music)

1501
01:06:47,808 --> 01:06:50,058
The fourth camera, I placed on the fly-walk,

1502
01:06:50,058 --> 01:06:52,608
this central platform in the
middle of the gas chamber

1503
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:57,305
so that no matter what, we would get a view

1504
01:06:57,305 --> 01:06:59,448
of the animals going down into the gas.

1505
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:01,590
And I would always be able to retrieve it.

1506
01:07:03,648 --> 01:07:06,315
(ominous music)

1507
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:18,378
Now, we had to get outta that place without being seen.

1508
01:07:18,378 --> 01:07:20,753
We had to get outta that place without being caught.

1509
01:07:23,197 --> 01:07:25,864
(ominous music)

1510
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:31,308
So we start walking across the kill floor again.

1511
01:07:31,308 --> 01:07:32,850
Luckily, there's no one there.

1512
01:07:35,490 --> 01:07:38,190
We go back into the washroom, there's no one in there.

1513
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:45,318
[Dan] We goes past the taps,
we goes through the corridor,

1514
01:07:45,318 --> 01:07:46,263
out the door.

1515
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,918
[Joey] And we make our way outside.

1516
01:07:48,918 --> 01:07:51,903
Like huge sense of relief.

1517
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:54,918
[Dan] That is like, whoa.

1518
01:07:54,918 --> 01:07:56,116
Yes, we've done it.

1519
01:07:56,116 --> 01:07:56,991
We've done it.

1520
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,741
Yes.

1521
01:08:02,741 --> 01:08:05,765
But obviously it wasn't over yet.

1522
01:08:05,765 --> 01:08:07,140
Oh, fantastic.

1523
01:08:10,659 --> 01:08:11,658
We're not there yet.

1524
01:08:11,658 --> 01:08:12,618
Yeah.

1525
01:08:12,618 --> 01:08:15,078
The retrieval is gonna be-

1526
01:08:15,078 --> 01:08:15,911
It's gonna be a bastard

1527
01:08:15,911 --> 01:08:17,028
It's gonna be a bit scarier.

1528
01:08:17,028 --> 01:08:17,861
Yeah.

1529
01:08:17,861 --> 01:08:19,458
I didn't feel any better actually,

1530
01:08:19,458 --> 01:08:22,728
because that was like the easier part of the mission.

1531
01:08:22,728 --> 01:08:25,008
The harder part would be retrieving.

1532
01:08:25,008 --> 01:08:28,068
And if those cages had got to the bottom

1533
01:08:28,068 --> 01:08:31,248
and Joey had to climb down
there and go down the ladder

1534
01:08:31,248 --> 01:08:35,448
and into the gas, that was a deadly zone to be in.

1535
01:08:35,448 --> 01:08:36,555
We've attached all four cameras

1536
01:08:36,555 --> 01:08:39,933
and we've made it back safely,
which is an amazing result.

1537
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:43,608
But for now, we just gotta try to calm down

1538
01:08:43,608 --> 01:08:46,698
because tomorrow's the big day retrieving,

1539
01:08:46,698 --> 01:08:48,708
and that's the more dangerous day.

1540
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:49,698
We need that footage.

1541
01:08:49,698 --> 01:08:51,168
We need them cameras to have worked.

1542
01:08:51,168 --> 01:08:53,568
We need those cameras to got what we wanted to get.

1543
01:08:53,568 --> 01:08:56,643
Now I feel like we're just one step away.

1544
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,518
What if I told you that the RSPCA,

1545
01:09:04,518 --> 01:09:07,998
that they put their stamp of approval on pigs

1546
01:09:07,998 --> 01:09:09,048
that are killed in these chambers.

1547
01:09:09,048 --> 01:09:10,908
Would that make you think that the gas

1548
01:09:10,908 --> 01:09:12,573
was more actually humane?

1549
01:09:13,470 --> 01:09:14,607
I'd absolutely think so.

1550
01:09:14,607 --> 01:09:15,441
Yeah.

1551
01:09:15,441 --> 01:09:16,274
[Joey] Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1552
01:09:16,274 --> 01:09:17,515
If they've got the RSPCA stamp on it,

1553
01:09:17,515 --> 01:09:19,578
I'd think it's more ethically correct.

1554
01:09:19,578 --> 01:09:20,448
[Joey] Yeah.

1555
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:22,158
What would you believe if you're seeing

1556
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,819
just a couple of packages with RSPCA or whatever?

1557
01:09:23,819 --> 01:09:24,652
Yeah.

1558
01:09:24,652 --> 01:09:25,758
You wouldn't feel as guilty about it, would you?

1559
01:09:25,758 --> 01:09:28,125
Yeah.

1560
01:09:28,125 --> 01:09:31,188
So the RSPCA had been misleading the public,

1561
01:09:31,188 --> 01:09:33,498
their assured logo has been put on meat

1562
01:09:33,498 --> 01:09:36,858
from pigs killed in gas chambers for years.

1563
01:09:36,858 --> 01:09:38,088
I needed clarification.

1564
01:09:38,088 --> 01:09:40,608
So I began searching their website

1565
01:09:40,608 --> 01:09:42,288
and surprisingly it was easier

1566
01:09:42,288 --> 01:09:45,828
to find recipes for bacon than their position on CO2.

1567
01:09:45,828 --> 01:09:48,648
We found out there was a massive farming convention

1568
01:09:48,648 --> 01:09:50,568
and because they'd been declining our interviews,

1569
01:09:50,568 --> 01:09:53,598
we decided to go in undercover as consultants.

1570
01:09:53,598 --> 01:09:54,685
Okay.

1571
01:09:54,685 --> 01:09:55,518
That's good.

1572
01:09:55,518 --> 01:09:58,563
Acting for the farming division of Pilgrim's BQP,

1573
01:09:59,966 --> 01:10:02,388
Tarion and I got passes to a major industry event

1574
01:10:02,388 --> 01:10:04,998
where they were due to have a stall.

1575
01:10:04,998 --> 01:10:06,798
It looked like just about every organization

1576
01:10:06,798 --> 01:10:09,438
we'd been ignored and turned down by were there.

1577
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:11,118
But today was about just one.

1578
01:10:11,118 --> 01:10:12,498
Here we go.

1579
01:10:12,498 --> 01:10:14,028
RSPCA Assured.

1580
01:10:14,028 --> 01:10:15,825
Dedicated to farm animal welfare

1581
01:10:15,825 --> 01:10:17,943
and CO2 gas chambers apparently.

1582
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:20,711
You work for the RSPCA Assured?

1583
01:10:20,711 --> 01:10:21,544
[RSPCA Employee] Yes.

1584
01:10:21,544 --> 01:10:22,377
Yeah.

1585
01:10:22,377 --> 01:10:23,210
[Joey] Oh, cool.

1586
01:10:23,210 --> 01:10:24,043
[RSPCA Employee] Uh, BQP?

1587
01:10:24,043 --> 01:10:24,876
[Joey] Yeah.

1588
01:10:24,876 --> 01:10:25,709
Yeah.

1589
01:10:25,709 --> 01:10:26,542
[RSPCA Employee] Nice.

1590
01:10:26,542 --> 01:10:27,375
[Joey] We've had a few consumer concerns

1591
01:10:27,375 --> 01:10:29,448
and they were talking about CO2 gas.

1592
01:10:29,448 --> 01:10:30,408
[RSPCA Employee] We don't do that anymore.

1593
01:10:30,408 --> 01:10:32,352
We've now moved away from that completely.

1594
01:10:32,352 --> 01:10:33,468
[Joey] RSPCA Assured then?

1595
01:10:33,468 --> 01:10:34,310
[RSPCA Employee] Yeah.

1596
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:35,143
[Joey] Oh really?

1597
01:10:35,143 --> 01:10:35,976
[RSPCA Employee] Yeah.

1598
01:10:35,976 --> 01:10:37,427
Well, I mean, we're dedicated to farming welfare.

1599
01:10:37,427 --> 01:10:39,318
We wouldn't want anything bad to be happening

1600
01:10:39,318 --> 01:10:40,768
to any animals, if we can.

1601
01:10:40,768 --> 01:10:42,648
[Joey] Well, the main thing question would be

1602
01:10:42,648 --> 01:10:45,404
that the welfare concerns are being handled

1603
01:10:45,404 --> 01:10:47,868
on the ground with farming.

1604
01:10:47,868 --> 01:10:48,937
[RSPCA Employee] Yeah.

1605
01:10:48,937 --> 01:10:50,718
[Joey] But in the slaughter, in the abattoirs.

1606
01:10:50,718 --> 01:10:51,558
[RSPCA Employee] Yeah.

1607
01:10:51,558 --> 01:10:53,448
[Joey] There's still the CO2 issue.

1608
01:10:53,448 --> 01:10:54,281
[RSPCA Employee] Okay, cool.

1609
01:10:54,281 --> 01:10:56,418
I'll go grab, Barry, he's an abattoir expert.

1610
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:57,333
You bear with me.

1611
01:10:58,830 --> 01:11:00,548
[Barry] Who do you work with at BQP?

1612
01:11:00,548 --> 01:11:02,058
[Joey] We are consultants.

1613
01:11:02,058 --> 01:11:03,291
[Barry] You're consultants for BQP?

1614
01:11:03,291 --> 01:11:06,708
[Joey] What we wanted to know is RSPCA will assure

1615
01:11:06,708 --> 01:11:08,748
the meat that comes from the pigs

1616
01:11:08,748 --> 01:11:10,690
that are killed in CO2 chambers still?

1617
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:12,503
Is that true?

1618
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,708
[Barry] I dunno 'cause I'm part of certification.

1619
01:11:15,708 --> 01:11:16,668
I'm just more interested in

1620
01:11:16,668 --> 01:11:18,586
where you work at BQP that's all.

1621
01:11:18,586 --> 01:11:19,788
Are you part of BQP as well?

1622
01:11:19,788 --> 01:11:20,621
[Tarion] Yeah.

1623
01:11:20,621 --> 01:11:22,196
[Barry] Who do you work with at BQP?

1624
01:11:22,196 --> 01:11:23,783
[Joey] Why so many questions.

1625
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:28,253
[Barry] Because BQP don't exist anymore, that's why.

1626
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:30,408
[Joey] Yes, we do.

1627
01:11:30,408 --> 01:11:31,241
[Barry] Right.

1628
01:11:31,241 --> 01:11:32,355
Okay.

1629
01:11:32,355 --> 01:11:34,578
[Joey] We still supply Pilgrim's Pride at Manchester

1630
01:11:34,578 --> 01:11:36,558
and there's a CO2 unit there

1631
01:11:36,558 --> 01:11:41,478
and RSPCA-approved pigs will go to their chambers.

1632
01:11:41,478 --> 01:11:43,458
[Barry] RSPCA don't run the abattoirs.

1633
01:11:43,458 --> 01:11:45,408
So you'd be better off
speaking to the abattoir people.

1634
01:11:45,408 --> 01:11:46,241
[Joey] No.

1635
01:11:46,241 --> 01:11:47,371
Yeah.

1636
01:11:47,371 --> 01:11:49,878
But you work for RSPCA Assured this label is on bacon.

1637
01:11:49,878 --> 01:11:50,711
Right?

1638
01:11:50,711 --> 01:11:54,078
These pigs go into gas chambers and they,

1639
01:11:54,078 --> 01:11:56,688
have you seen footage from inside of there?

1640
01:11:56,688 --> 01:11:58,638
Inside of CO2 gas chambers.

1641
01:11:58,638 --> 01:12:01,661
And what did you think about, what did you think?

1642
01:12:01,661 --> 01:12:05,087
They're suffering in the gas chambers.

1643
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:06,228
[Barry] How do you know they're suffering?

1644
01:12:06,228 --> 01:12:07,998
[Joey] They are definitely suffering.

1645
01:12:07,998 --> 01:12:09,795
I would encourage you to watch the footage,

1646
01:12:09,795 --> 01:12:12,288
but the stamp is being put on the bacon

1647
01:12:12,288 --> 01:12:13,605
from pigs that go to the gas chambers.

1648
01:12:13,605 --> 01:12:14,438
And you told me

1649
01:12:14,438 --> 01:12:17,463
that they don't use gas chambers anymore, RSPCA.

1650
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:20,775
[RSPCA Employee] Sorry, what?

1651
01:12:20,775 --> 01:12:22,033
I'm lost, buddy.

1652
01:12:22,033 --> 01:12:22,866
[Joey] That's okay.

1653
01:12:22,866 --> 01:12:24,258
We're just asking simple questions.

1654
01:12:24,258 --> 01:12:25,091
That's all.

1655
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:26,065
[Barry] So am I.

1656
01:12:26,065 --> 01:12:26,898
What's the name of your company.

1657
01:12:26,898 --> 01:12:28,158
[Joey] We told you we told you BQP?

1658
01:12:28,158 --> 01:12:30,068
No.

1659
01:12:30,068 --> 01:12:30,901
You said you're doing consultancy for BQP.

1660
01:12:30,901 --> 01:12:31,734
[Joey] Yeah.

1661
01:12:31,734 --> 01:12:32,567
So freelancing.

1662
01:12:32,567 --> 01:12:33,400
[Barry] Yeah.

1663
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,233
So what's the name of your freelance company?

1664
01:12:34,233 --> 01:12:35,066
Freelancing.

1665
01:12:35,066 --> 01:12:35,899
I don't have to give you all my personal information.

1666
01:12:35,899 --> 01:12:36,732
[Barry] No, no.

1667
01:12:36,732 --> 01:12:37,565
[Joey] We're just simply asking questions

1668
01:12:37,565 --> 01:12:40,188
'cause RSPCA are a big
organization, charity organization,

1669
01:12:40,188 --> 01:12:41,478
and we wanna know about

1670
01:12:41,478 --> 01:12:43,008
why they're still approving gas chambers.

1671
01:12:43,008 --> 01:12:43,841
That's all.

1672
01:12:43,841 --> 01:12:44,868
Just a simple question.

1673
01:12:44,868 --> 01:12:47,238
We're just inquiring about animal welfare, that's all,

1674
01:12:47,238 --> 01:12:48,723
as a concerned consumer.

1675
01:12:49,848 --> 01:12:53,658
But no one seems to have answers.

1676
01:12:53,658 --> 01:12:55,638
[RSPCA Employee] You seem to have a lot of information.

1677
01:12:55,638 --> 01:12:57,658
I'm not sure what answers you're looking for.

1678
01:12:57,658 --> 01:12:59,268
[Joey] Well, but basically simple question.

1679
01:12:59,268 --> 01:13:02,358
It's why do RSPCA assured still put their logo

1680
01:13:02,358 --> 01:13:05,118
on pigs that are killed in CO2 gas

1681
01:13:05,118 --> 01:13:07,038
after they've called for a ban.

1682
01:13:07,038 --> 01:13:08,448
[RSPCA Employee] So, what I'm gonna do

1683
01:13:08,448 --> 01:13:10,518
is I'm gonna take your
question and your contact details.

1684
01:13:10,518 --> 01:13:12,108
[Joey] Why were they getting so defensive

1685
01:13:12,108 --> 01:13:13,908
when I was just asking simple questions

1686
01:13:13,908 --> 01:13:15,333
about their own guidelines?

1687
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,448
I know it's a lot of pressure for you, mate,

1688
01:13:17,448 --> 01:13:20,148
but we just wanting to know, that's all.

1689
01:13:20,148 --> 01:13:22,390
It made me feel like they were holding back.

1690
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:27,048
I would say the RSPCA in its duty

1691
01:13:27,048 --> 01:13:29,355
and I think in the public eye,

1692
01:13:29,355 --> 01:13:30,858
the public would expect the RSPCA

1693
01:13:30,858 --> 01:13:34,038
to actually protect animals.

1694
01:13:34,038 --> 01:13:36,468
I think them signing off on a source method,

1695
01:13:36,468 --> 01:13:41,268
which is known to be causing pain and distress

1696
01:13:41,268 --> 01:13:43,008
on a massive scale.

1697
01:13:43,008 --> 01:13:44,778
We're talking millions and millions of animals

1698
01:13:44,778 --> 01:13:46,608
suffering like this every year.

1699
01:13:46,608 --> 01:13:49,668
I think that's false advertising for one.

1700
01:13:49,668 --> 01:13:52,338
But I think it's also quite awful.

1701
01:13:52,338 --> 01:13:56,028
Like I would implore any policy-maker at the RSPCA

1702
01:13:56,028 --> 01:13:58,548
to sit through that footage of pigs in gas chambers

1703
01:13:58,548 --> 01:14:00,498
and not change that policy.

1704
01:14:00,498 --> 01:14:04,435
Finally, the RSPCA did get back to us.

1705
01:14:04,435 --> 01:14:07,008
"We are keen to see more humane methods developed,

1706
01:14:07,008 --> 01:14:09,018
including the commercial use of inert gases,

1707
01:14:09,018 --> 01:14:10,818
which are not adversive to pigs.

1708
01:14:10,818 --> 01:14:13,248
Currently, high concentrations of CO2

1709
01:14:13,248 --> 01:14:14,328
or electric stunning

1710
01:14:14,328 --> 01:14:17,448
are the only commercially
viable methods available for pigs.

1711
01:14:17,448 --> 01:14:19,338
So more research and development is needed

1712
01:14:19,338 --> 01:14:21,348
into more humane alternatives,

1713
01:14:21,348 --> 01:14:24,318
"which will require significant investment."

1714
01:14:24,318 --> 01:14:26,538
So why on Earth was a charity that's set up

1715
01:14:26,538 --> 01:14:28,728
to protect animals so concerned

1716
01:14:28,728 --> 01:14:30,558
with what's commercially viable.

1717
01:14:30,558 --> 01:14:32,808
That's like a human rights organization

1718
01:14:32,808 --> 01:14:35,673
prioritizing corporate profit
over the rights of people.

1719
01:14:36,990 --> 01:14:40,038
We found out that the RSPCA
has a technical advisory board

1720
01:14:40,038 --> 01:14:42,438
that sets a standard for their assured label.

1721
01:14:42,438 --> 01:14:43,818
And guess who's on it?

1722
01:14:43,818 --> 01:14:45,408
About a half a dozen representatives

1723
01:14:45,408 --> 01:14:47,688
from major players in the pork industry,

1724
01:14:47,688 --> 01:14:49,578
including a pig breeding company,

1725
01:14:49,578 --> 01:14:52,968
a major pork producer, Pilgrim's Pride.

1726
01:14:52,968 --> 01:14:55,488
So a charity that's set up to protect animals

1727
01:14:55,488 --> 01:14:58,623
also consults meat producers
on how best to kill them.

1728
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:00,948
And it gets worse.

1729
01:15:00,948 --> 01:15:03,798
I also learned that the RSPCA gets paid by farmers

1730
01:15:03,798 --> 01:15:05,988
to be a part of their assured scheme.

1731
01:15:05,988 --> 01:15:08,988
But most shockingly, the
RSPCA receives a percentage

1732
01:15:08,988 --> 01:15:10,818
from the sold products.

1733
01:15:10,818 --> 01:15:13,428
This means the more assured meat that's sold,

1734
01:15:13,428 --> 01:15:15,442
the more money they make.

1735
01:15:15,442 --> 01:15:19,158
And this amounted to 4.5 million pounds in 2021.

1736
01:15:19,158 --> 01:15:22,473
This isn't just a conflict
of interest, this is a sellout.

1737
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:25,518
So after the convention,

1738
01:15:25,518 --> 01:15:28,248
RSPCA had conveniently updated their website

1739
01:15:28,248 --> 01:15:31,158
to include their position on CO2 gassing,

1740
01:15:31,158 --> 01:15:35,928
they apparently use 90% concentration of gas

1741
01:15:35,928 --> 01:15:38,118
other than the legal requirement of 80%.

1742
01:15:38,118 --> 01:15:41,748
Because in their words it causes less suffering.

1743
01:15:41,748 --> 01:15:42,918
So do you think they just fall asleep,

1744
01:15:42,918 --> 01:15:44,598
sort of just go to sleep in the gas,

1745
01:15:44,598 --> 01:15:45,851
like a sleeping gas kind of thing?

1746
01:15:45,851 --> 01:15:47,769
It's not something I like to think about.

1747
01:15:47,769 --> 01:15:48,602
Yeah.

1748
01:15:48,602 --> 01:15:50,309
I would like to think it was-

1749
01:15:50,309 --> 01:15:51,142
[Joey] Just gentle.

1750
01:15:51,142 --> 01:15:52,889
Just going to the dentist and just.

1751
01:15:52,889 --> 01:15:53,722
[Joey] Yeah.

1752
01:15:53,722 --> 01:15:54,986
But I don't think it probably is.

1753
01:15:54,986 --> 01:15:56,149
[Joey] Do you think they feel anything?

1754
01:15:56,149 --> 01:15:58,308
Do you think it's a pleasant experience or just?

1755
01:15:58,308 --> 01:15:59,808
Probably not.

1756
01:15:59,808 --> 01:16:01,158
Probably not a pleasant experience though.

1757
01:16:01,158 --> 01:16:02,270
No.

1758
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:03,103
Because think about it.

1759
01:16:03,103 --> 01:16:05,148
If we was to get our oxygen taken away,

1760
01:16:05,148 --> 01:16:07,008
then it takes us a while for us to die

1761
01:16:07,008 --> 01:16:08,328
from asphyxiation, innit?

1762
01:16:08,328 --> 01:16:09,449
[Joey] Yeah.

1763
01:16:09,449 --> 01:16:10,991
So I don't know.

1764
01:16:12,158 --> 01:16:14,358
It just so happens that the
gas chamber at Pilgrim's Pride

1765
01:16:14,358 --> 01:16:16,998
conforms to the RSPCA standard.

1766
01:16:16,998 --> 01:16:18,978
So I think it's about time consumers got to see

1767
01:16:18,978 --> 01:16:20,620
what they were paying extra for.

1768
01:16:21,588 --> 01:16:24,858
(suspenseful music)

1769
01:16:24,858 --> 01:16:26,538
Well, it's either I put the goggles on my head

1770
01:16:26,538 --> 01:16:28,076
or I have the headlamp on.

1771
01:16:28,076 --> 01:16:29,088
'Cause this is what's gonna save my butt.

1772
01:16:29,088 --> 01:16:30,408
The tension in the room,

1773
01:16:30,408 --> 01:16:31,950
you could cut it with a knife.

1774
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:36,258
It's called a lifesaver.

1775
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:37,458
I look calm on the outside,

1776
01:16:37,458 --> 01:16:40,278
but on the inside I am terrified.

1777
01:16:40,278 --> 01:16:42,288
I can hold that onto the ladder

1778
01:16:42,288 --> 01:16:45,191
while I'm reaching around, grabbing stuff, you know?

1779
01:16:45,191 --> 01:16:46,938
And I'm gonna need this more tonight

1780
01:16:46,938 --> 01:16:50,148
because I'll be going down into the gas, potentially.

1781
01:16:50,148 --> 01:16:52,368
The most bizarre feeling though.

1782
01:16:52,368 --> 01:16:54,288
Haven't felt anything like it before.

1783
01:16:54,288 --> 01:16:58,642
Hoping that the chambers are at the top.

1784
01:16:58,642 --> 01:17:01,684
(suspenseful music)

1785
01:17:04,650 --> 01:17:06,300
Camera needs to be ready to rock.

1786
01:17:07,656 --> 01:17:10,656
(suspenseful music)

1787
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,078
Okay.

1788
01:17:18,078 --> 01:17:19,248
Clipboard?

1789
01:17:19,248 --> 01:17:20,763
[Joey] Clipboard is here.

1790
01:17:21,690 --> 01:17:25,098
When he was walking out of the door at the house,

1791
01:17:25,098 --> 01:17:26,748
there was a very strong possibility

1792
01:17:26,748 --> 01:17:28,440
that I would never see him again.

1793
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:34,015
You ready?

1794
01:17:34,015 --> 01:17:35,477
Yeah.

1795
01:17:35,477 --> 01:17:38,519
(suspenseful music)

1796
01:17:45,150 --> 01:17:45,941
Alright, here we go.

1797
01:17:45,941 --> 01:17:46,774
Round two.

1798
01:17:46,774 --> 01:17:48,558
[Dan] Round two, piece of piss.

1799
01:17:48,558 --> 01:17:49,919
[Joey] Let's get this shit.

1800
01:17:49,919 --> 01:17:51,060
[Dan] Piece of piss.

1801
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:52,287
[Joey] If I have to put my oxygen tank on,

1802
01:17:52,287 --> 01:17:54,079
I'll put the tank on.

1803
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:02,973
So basically we made our way back the same way,

1804
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:08,973
I was thinking we're gonna get caught, this is it.

1805
01:18:09,832 --> 01:18:12,858
(suspenseful music)

1806
01:18:12,858 --> 01:18:13,818
[Dan] They might have sussed us out,

1807
01:18:13,818 --> 01:18:14,898
they might have found the cameras,

1808
01:18:14,898 --> 01:18:16,488
they might have the cameras in the office

1809
01:18:16,488 --> 01:18:18,323
and the police there waiting for us.

1810
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:22,458
It's just like there were so many things

1811
01:18:22,458 --> 01:18:23,583
that could go wrong.

1812
01:18:24,512 --> 01:18:27,588
(suspenseful music)

1813
01:18:27,588 --> 01:18:29,688
[Joey] Dan's in front of me and he gets to the door

1814
01:18:29,688 --> 01:18:30,963
and he just stops.

1815
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:34,548
Gets to the door, peeks through.

1816
01:18:34,548 --> 01:18:36,768
There's someone there.

1817
01:18:36,768 --> 01:18:38,427
And that was it, I just froze.

1818
01:18:38,427 --> 01:18:41,988
I just thought like, we're
dressed as maintenance workers,

1819
01:18:41,988 --> 01:18:43,380
let's just give it a crack.

1820
01:18:44,818 --> 01:18:45,655
[Joey] Let's go.

1821
01:18:45,655 --> 01:18:46,698
And then Joey just walked straight past me

1822
01:18:46,698 --> 01:18:48,517
and walks right through the door.

1823
01:18:48,517 --> 01:18:49,350
And that was it.

1824
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:50,183
I had to follow him.

1825
01:18:50,183 --> 01:18:51,618
That was it.

1826
01:18:51,618 --> 01:18:55,008
We walked through the door, McGaffey's there,

1827
01:18:55,008 --> 01:18:56,718
who'd known me for nearly three and a half weeks

1828
01:18:56,718 --> 01:18:59,278
when I worked there, he looked straight me in the eye

1829
01:18:59,278 --> 01:19:01,970
and I just looked straight ahead, carried on walking,

1830
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:06,138
[Joey] Streamlined straight to the gas chamber,

1831
01:19:06,138 --> 01:19:09,183
still thinking he's gonna yell out, stop.

1832
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:12,408
[Dan] Walk around the corner and I just thought

1833
01:19:12,408 --> 01:19:13,241
please don't follow us.

1834
01:19:13,241 --> 01:19:15,018
Please don't follow us.

1835
01:19:15,018 --> 01:19:16,878
But I didn't wanna look round.

1836
01:19:16,878 --> 01:19:19,863
'Cause if you start looking
round, you look suspicious.

1837
01:19:20,846 --> 01:19:22,188
(suspenseful music)

1838
01:19:22,188 --> 01:19:23,958
[Joey] We get to the gas chamber again,

1839
01:19:23,958 --> 01:19:25,758
climb up the ladder.

1840
01:19:25,758 --> 01:19:27,648
Gets on top of the gas chamber,

1841
01:19:27,648 --> 01:19:29,778
and then I just glanced over

1842
01:19:29,778 --> 01:19:31,758
and I could, nobody's followed us.

1843
01:19:31,758 --> 01:19:32,591
Nobody's followed us.

1844
01:19:32,591 --> 01:19:33,753
We're fine, we're great.

1845
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:39,348
So Dan opens up the hatch and I was like, oh my God,

1846
01:19:39,348 --> 01:19:40,988
the chamber's filled with gas.

1847
01:19:40,988 --> 01:19:45,888
It was like a thick silvery mist and it shocked me.

1848
01:19:45,888 --> 01:19:48,243
So below the fly-walk is where the gas is.

1849
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:53,553
So I had to be extremely
careful not to do anything stupid.

1850
01:19:54,429 --> 01:19:57,429
(suspenseful music)

1851
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:02,688
He wasn't climbing in, I noticed something.

1852
01:20:02,688 --> 01:20:06,393
It's like there's a haze, there's mist and it's pungent.

1853
01:20:07,336 --> 01:20:10,003
(ominous music)

1854
01:20:16,099 --> 01:20:19,683
And then I began the mission
of pulling off the cameras.

1855
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:23,314
I retrieved the first camera.

1856
01:20:23,314 --> 01:20:25,323
It's underneath the fly-walk quite easy.

1857
01:20:27,450 --> 01:20:28,821
The second camera I grabbed was at the top.

1858
01:20:28,821 --> 01:20:31,713
So I just pulled it off by the lens and chuck in the bag.

1859
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,398
The other top camera, which
is an important camera to grab,

1860
01:20:37,398 --> 01:20:40,968
was in the second level.

1861
01:20:40,968 --> 01:20:42,310
And that's the death zone.

1862
01:20:43,650 --> 01:20:45,631
So I had to get the oxygen tank on.

1863
01:20:45,631 --> 01:20:50,673
I get my goggles on and I start squeezing my body down

1864
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,458
this little gap to get down

1865
01:20:52,458 --> 01:20:55,277
and wrap myself around to get to the ladder.

1866
01:20:56,643 --> 01:20:59,643
(suspenseful music)

1867
01:21:01,797 --> 01:21:03,528
This is a two-story drop below us.

1868
01:21:03,528 --> 01:21:04,563
There's gas.

1869
01:21:05,907 --> 01:21:07,908
And my worst nightmares were coming through.

1870
01:21:07,908 --> 01:21:09,948
He would have to go down that ladder.

1871
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:12,633
And if anything happened, I would have to leave him.

1872
01:21:15,870 --> 01:21:19,098
I quickly stepped down, I step onto the second cage,

1873
01:21:19,098 --> 01:21:21,438
and I grab the lens.

1874
01:21:21,438 --> 01:21:24,138
And now there's gas, I'm smothered in gas,

1875
01:21:24,138 --> 01:21:26,418
there's gas all around me.

1876
01:21:26,418 --> 01:21:30,498
And I begin bringing gas in through my goggles

1877
01:21:30,498 --> 01:21:32,208
and I'm bringing it into my nose,

1878
01:21:32,208 --> 01:21:35,058
and it's going into my eyes, and it's fizzing in my eyes,

1879
01:21:35,058 --> 01:21:36,348
and it's starting to burn.

1880
01:21:36,348 --> 01:21:38,767
And I begin to hyperventilate.

1881
01:21:38,767 --> 01:21:39,600
I couldn't go after him.

1882
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,467
I couldn't go and see if he was all right.

1883
01:21:41,467 --> 01:21:42,535
I couldn't help in any way.

1884
01:21:42,535 --> 01:21:44,015
I just had to sit there and wait.

1885
01:21:44,015 --> 01:21:45,138
And it was like an eternity.

1886
01:21:45,138 --> 01:21:47,073
It was like, it just went on forever.

1887
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:50,988
So I'm thinking, God, I've got this camera in my hand.

1888
01:21:50,988 --> 01:21:52,608
I've got these goggles filled with gas,

1889
01:21:52,608 --> 01:21:55,848
and I've gotta reach back up to the ladder,

1890
01:21:55,848 --> 01:22:00,333
compose myself and start
pulling myself back up this ladder.

1891
01:22:01,770 --> 01:22:04,788
[Dan] He comes stomping up and he is hyperventilating.

1892
01:22:04,788 --> 01:22:05,688
He can't breathe.

1893
01:22:05,688 --> 01:22:07,293
He's panicking, he's shaking.

1894
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:11,598
Just trying to get some oxygen back into me actually,

1895
01:22:11,598 --> 01:22:14,418
put the third camera in the bag.

1896
01:22:14,418 --> 01:22:15,960
And there was one more to get.

1897
01:22:17,235 --> 01:22:19,902
(ominous music)

1898
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:23,988
This was the bottom camera, but it had swapped sides.

1899
01:22:23,988 --> 01:22:25,780
And now it was a lot harder to get.

1900
01:22:27,187 --> 01:22:29,854
(ominous music)

1901
01:22:31,170 --> 01:22:34,848
I'm lying on the fly-walk, still a bit dizzy,

1902
01:22:34,848 --> 01:22:38,028
reaching out to this camera, trying to pull it off.

1903
01:22:38,028 --> 01:22:41,718
And it's caked in feces and urine.

1904
01:22:41,718 --> 01:22:43,863
It's just really slippery.

1905
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:49,638
And my little arms aren't long enough

1906
01:22:49,638 --> 01:22:51,855
and I'm trying to pull this camera off

1907
01:22:51,855 --> 01:22:53,538
and I keep slipping and slipping,

1908
01:22:53,538 --> 01:22:55,230
and I just can't get a good grip.

1909
01:22:56,894 --> 01:22:59,898
(suspenseful music)

1910
01:22:59,898 --> 01:23:02,268
We need every single one of these cameras

1911
01:23:02,268 --> 01:23:03,108
in case one has failed.

1912
01:23:03,108 --> 01:23:05,000
So we can't just leave a camera here.

1913
01:23:05,854 --> 01:23:07,968
(suspenseful music)

1914
01:23:07,968 --> 01:23:10,987
So obviously, you needed someone with longer hands.

1915
01:23:15,293 --> 01:23:17,904
(Joey and Dan speaking indistinctly)

1916
01:23:17,904 --> 01:23:19,446
[Dan] All right.

1917
01:23:22,763 --> 01:23:24,439
Be careful, Dan.

1918
01:23:24,439 --> 01:23:27,481
(suspenseful music)

1919
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:31,971
And then he laid down on the fly-walk

1920
01:23:31,971 --> 01:23:34,428
and I'm there on top of him holding him

1921
01:23:34,428 --> 01:23:36,033
by his waistband like this.

1922
01:23:37,110 --> 01:23:39,590
I can smell the gas again.

1923
01:23:39,590 --> 01:23:41,178
(suspenseful music)

1924
01:23:41,178 --> 01:23:42,675
I gets down and gets my arm underneath

1925
01:23:42,675 --> 01:23:47,238
and I can just get my fingertips
on the edge of this block,

1926
01:23:47,238 --> 01:23:48,303
which is the camera.

1927
01:23:49,310 --> 01:23:51,621
And then I'm thinking, what if I drop the camera,

1928
01:23:51,621 --> 01:23:53,928
the footage, it's gonna go down to the bottom,

1929
01:23:53,928 --> 01:23:55,038
it's gonna hit the deck

1930
01:23:55,038 --> 01:23:57,498
and we're not gonna be able to get it back.

1931
01:23:57,498 --> 01:24:00,078
So I grabs it, it's slippery, it's sliding.

1932
01:24:00,078 --> 01:24:02,928
I pulls it and I thought, I'm just gonna have to go for it.

1933
01:24:02,928 --> 01:24:03,761
There's another way.

1934
01:24:03,761 --> 01:24:06,318
And just pulled it and it came away.

1935
01:24:06,318 --> 01:24:07,193
Yeah, got it.

1936
01:24:12,467 --> 01:24:15,438
But it was far from over because then, of course,

1937
01:24:15,438 --> 01:24:17,220
we have to get out.

1938
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:20,262
(suspenseful music)

1939
01:24:23,404 --> 01:24:25,458
So we get outta the gas chamber, we go down the ladder.

1940
01:24:25,458 --> 01:24:29,020
And I just thought to myself,
there is no power on earth

1941
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,538
that will get these cameras off of me.

1942
01:24:32,538 --> 01:24:34,548
Like you will have to kill me

1943
01:24:34,548 --> 01:24:35,688
to get these cameras off of me

1944
01:24:35,688 --> 01:24:37,430
after all we've just been through.

1945
01:24:38,319 --> 01:24:40,998
(suspenseful music)

1946
01:24:40,998 --> 01:24:43,788
If anybody caught us, we had a plan,

1947
01:24:43,788 --> 01:24:45,738
just run like hell and get out of there.

1948
01:24:45,738 --> 01:24:46,578
That was it.

1949
01:24:46,578 --> 01:24:47,838
That was the plan.

1950
01:24:47,838 --> 01:24:49,827
That's all we needed to do.

1951
01:24:49,827 --> 01:24:52,188
(suspenseful music)

1952
01:24:52,188 --> 01:24:55,593
Walks back through, who was there still, McGaffey.

1953
01:24:58,837 --> 01:25:00,301
So we had masks on,

1954
01:25:00,301 --> 01:25:03,768
but I just distinctly remember
he looked up at me again,

1955
01:25:03,768 --> 01:25:05,375
but he couldn't see it.

1956
01:25:05,375 --> 01:25:06,994
But I had a big massive grin on my face

1957
01:25:06,994 --> 01:25:08,327
and I just nodded at him.

1958
01:25:08,327 --> 01:25:11,096
And then we walked out through the door.

1959
01:25:11,096 --> 01:25:14,138
(suspenseful music)

1960
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:19,445
[Joey] So head down and just walk straight out of there

1961
01:25:19,445 --> 01:25:23,178
with a bag filled with four cameras

1962
01:25:23,178 --> 01:25:25,533
of secretly filmed gas chamber footage.

1963
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:28,143
The first of its kind in the UK.

1964
01:25:29,116 --> 01:25:32,305
(suspenseful music)

1965
01:25:32,305 --> 01:25:33,680
We've done it.

1966
01:25:34,727 --> 01:25:35,894
We've done it.

1967
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:50,118
All those times I'd spent outside of that gas chamber

1968
01:25:50,118 --> 01:25:54,768
in Manchester, just right
there in the park by the wall.

1969
01:25:54,768 --> 01:25:55,968
And I was convinced

1970
01:25:55,968 --> 01:25:58,728
that what was going on in there was horrible.

1971
01:25:58,728 --> 01:26:02,898
Now we had the footage, and that footage does not lie.

1972
01:26:02,898 --> 01:26:07,038
The industry may lie to you,
but this footage is the truth.

1973
01:26:07,038 --> 01:26:10,998
Now, no one from the UK can ever apply the word humane

1974
01:26:10,998 --> 01:26:13,578
to these gas chambers ever again.

1975
01:26:13,578 --> 01:26:15,070
Now, there was no denying it.

1976
01:26:16,745 --> 01:26:19,745
(suspenseful music)

1977
01:26:24,725 --> 01:26:27,642
(machine whirring)

1978
01:26:36,625 --> 01:26:39,375
(pigs screaming)

1979
01:26:56,426 --> 01:26:58,188
[Philip] What carbon dioxide does

1980
01:26:58,188 --> 01:27:03,230
is it makes the pigs have a deeply aversive reaction.

1981
01:27:05,337 --> 01:27:07,398
The chamber starts turning,

1982
01:27:07,398 --> 01:27:09,738
and as soon as they hit that second level,

1983
01:27:09,738 --> 01:27:12,888
they start freaking out, struggling,

1984
01:27:12,888 --> 01:27:14,898
desperately trying to escape.

1985
01:27:14,898 --> 01:27:16,278
They can't get any oxygen.

1986
01:27:16,278 --> 01:27:17,361
They look like they're suffering.

1987
01:27:17,361 --> 01:27:19,308
They start to hyperventilate.

1988
01:27:19,308 --> 01:27:21,050
They feel like they can't breathe.

1989
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:24,888
The carbon dioxide then gets into their eyes,

1990
01:27:24,888 --> 01:27:26,778
their nostrils, their lungs,

1991
01:27:26,778 --> 01:27:29,388
they're burning from the inside out.

1992
01:27:29,388 --> 01:27:31,908
And these animals are terrified,

1993
01:27:31,908 --> 01:27:35,238
in most hideous pain and suffering.

1994
01:27:35,238 --> 01:27:39,468
And that goes on for 15 seconds, 30 seconds,

1995
01:27:39,468 --> 01:27:40,683
up to a minute or more.

1996
01:27:41,696 --> 01:27:44,446
(pigs screaming)

1997
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:49,038
That is what some tried to describe

1998
01:27:49,038 --> 01:27:51,243
as humane slaughter.

1999
01:27:51,243 --> 01:27:53,260
[BMPA Employee] Fairly well documented that it's one

2000
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:56,118
of the humane methods of slaughter.

2001
01:27:56,118 --> 01:27:57,528
[Narrator] All Red Tractor animals

2002
01:27:57,528 --> 01:27:59,210
are treated with compassion.

2003
01:27:59,210 --> 01:28:00,147
[Pilgrim's Pride Employee] The gas stunning

2004
01:28:00,147 --> 01:28:05,189
is currently the most humane
way of stunning animals.

2005
01:28:05,550 --> 01:28:07,818
[Theresa May] Be able to do that and maintain

2006
01:28:07,818 --> 01:28:09,828
those high standards and quality standards

2007
01:28:09,828 --> 01:28:12,518
for which we have a very good
reputation across the world.

2008
01:28:12,518 --> 01:28:14,148
We all know it's wrong.

2009
01:28:14,148 --> 01:28:15,798
We all know slaughterhouses are bad.

2010
01:28:15,798 --> 01:28:18,408
That's why no one wants to look at the footage.

2011
01:28:18,408 --> 01:28:20,050
And we all know it's not humane.

2012
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:24,108
[Philip] Carbon dioxide, killing of pigs

2013
01:28:24,108 --> 01:28:28,159
is non-stun slaughter of the worst kind.

2014
01:28:28,159 --> 01:28:30,951
(pigs screaming)

2015
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:36,168
This footage is so clear.

2016
01:28:36,168 --> 01:28:41,210
Just the innocent animal is
just desperately gasping for air

2017
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:44,808
and flailing about in pain.

2018
01:28:44,808 --> 01:28:47,043
It's something nightmares are made of.

2019
01:28:49,470 --> 01:28:52,518
Couldn't be more cruel to the pigs

2020
01:28:52,518 --> 01:28:54,408
if you just cut their throats

2021
01:28:54,408 --> 01:28:55,833
and just left them to die.

2022
01:28:59,610 --> 01:29:00,443
Jesus.

2023
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:04,428
When they get down into the gas, see, it's moving down.

2024
01:29:04,428 --> 01:29:05,261
Oh.

2025
01:29:05,261 --> 01:29:07,218
You'll see when they start to react.

2026
01:29:07,218 --> 01:29:08,567
Absolutely unbelievable.

2027
01:29:08,567 --> 01:29:11,229
Oh my God.

2028
01:29:11,229 --> 01:29:12,062
That's horrific, man.

2029
01:29:12,062 --> 01:29:13,896
That's absolutely, that's barbaric to a point.

2030
01:29:13,896 --> 01:29:14,771
Yeah.

2031
01:29:20,287 --> 01:29:22,368
Yeah, no, that's awful.

2032
01:29:22,368 --> 01:29:24,798
Can we stop with that one, please?

2033
01:29:24,798 --> 01:29:26,688
Yeah, no, I don't agree with that.

2034
01:29:26,688 --> 01:29:29,305
That's awful.

2035
01:29:29,305 --> 01:29:30,738
That is so cruel.

2036
01:29:30,738 --> 01:29:33,825
And in fact, it's upset me watching that.

2037
01:29:33,825 --> 01:29:37,668
The most appropriate thing
would be to stop killing pigs.

2038
01:29:37,668 --> 01:29:38,868
If you can't do it in a way

2039
01:29:38,868 --> 01:29:41,628
that's not gonna cause extreme suffering,

2040
01:29:41,628 --> 01:29:43,698
which I think the consumer expects.

2041
01:29:43,698 --> 01:29:48,738
They're given this humane
slaughter lie, essentially.

2042
01:29:48,738 --> 01:29:51,378
So if we can't do that,

2043
01:29:51,378 --> 01:29:55,274
we absolutely shouldn't be slaughtering pigs at all.

2044
01:29:55,274 --> 01:29:59,118
So theoretically, what humane alternatives to CO2

2045
01:29:59,118 --> 01:30:01,308
would the AWC like to see in the future?

2046
01:30:01,308 --> 01:30:03,288
We don't know what the answer is.

2047
01:30:03,288 --> 01:30:05,058
And there's work going on at the moment

2048
01:30:05,058 --> 01:30:08,298
on the use of nitrogen foams.

2049
01:30:08,298 --> 01:30:11,268
But if we knew what the answer was,

2050
01:30:11,268 --> 01:30:13,548
I can assure you we would've recommended

2051
01:30:13,548 --> 01:30:15,738
that it had to be in place now.

2052
01:30:15,738 --> 01:30:18,408
Until there is an alternative available

2053
01:30:18,408 --> 01:30:19,668
wouldn't the recommendation be

2054
01:30:19,668 --> 01:30:21,843
to just stop killing pigs altogether?

2055
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:23,688
I thought you might ask that.

2056
01:30:23,688 --> 01:30:25,908
We've had the problem, haven't we?

2057
01:30:25,908 --> 01:30:28,878
I can only say that I'm not here to make any comment

2058
01:30:28,878 --> 01:30:32,568
about people's lifestyle and people's choices.

2059
01:30:32,568 --> 01:30:35,238
I'm here that people farm and therefore,

2060
01:30:35,238 --> 01:30:38,688
while people are farming, I believe those animals

2061
01:30:38,688 --> 01:30:40,580
must have a good life and a good end.

2062
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:44,478
But just from the AWCs position,

2063
01:30:44,478 --> 01:30:45,738
wouldn't they just advise the government

2064
01:30:45,738 --> 01:30:47,388
you should stop killing pigs immediately

2065
01:30:47,388 --> 01:30:50,063
because they're suffering
horribly in these chambers?

2066
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:53,008
No, we haven't advised that.

2067
01:30:53,008 --> 01:30:56,208
And I don't think that comes under our remit.

2068
01:30:56,208 --> 01:30:57,363
Even as advice.

2069
01:30:58,530 --> 01:31:00,258
Even as advice

2070
01:31:00,258 --> 01:31:05,178
The industry know there's no humane, humane,

2071
01:31:05,178 --> 01:31:06,948
viable method of slaughter at the moment.

2072
01:31:06,948 --> 01:31:09,768
But economically, that's what we've got.

2073
01:31:09,768 --> 01:31:14,810
A possible alternatives may
be using a non-aversive gas

2074
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:20,120
to render the animal unconscious, argon, for example.

2075
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:24,588
I've known researchers
looking into alternatives to this

2076
01:31:24,588 --> 01:31:28,038
and stopping eating pigs and poultry as a result.

2077
01:31:28,038 --> 01:31:30,708
Even the ones they're trialing as a better option

2078
01:31:30,708 --> 01:31:33,918
are absolutely horrendous.

2079
01:31:33,918 --> 01:31:35,583
And CO2 is worse.

2080
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:39,168
Other examples, electrical stunning,

2081
01:31:39,168 --> 01:31:40,560
which has its own problems.

2082
01:31:42,030 --> 01:31:42,828
They're getting a shock

2083
01:31:42,828 --> 01:31:45,213
through their brain and their body.

2084
01:31:46,050 --> 01:31:48,243
That's not at all acceptable.

2085
01:31:49,506 --> 01:31:50,898
I'd really like to expand on it a bit

2086
01:31:50,898 --> 01:31:55,188
because the conversation
usually is steered towards trying

2087
01:31:55,188 --> 01:31:57,258
to find the right way to kill.

2088
01:31:57,258 --> 01:31:59,538
Wouldn't the most humane thing be

2089
01:31:59,538 --> 01:32:00,551
to not kill the animals at all.

2090
01:32:00,551 --> 01:32:04,548
Through the animal's eyes
their life is just as precious

2091
01:32:04,548 --> 01:32:07,368
and important to them as your life is to you

2092
01:32:07,368 --> 01:32:09,138
or mine is to me.

2093
01:32:09,138 --> 01:32:10,368
If you wouldn't trade places

2094
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:11,748
with an animal in a slaughterhouse

2095
01:32:11,748 --> 01:32:13,908
to be humanely slaughtered,

2096
01:32:13,908 --> 01:32:15,918
I think that will tell you
everything you need to know

2097
01:32:15,918 --> 01:32:18,108
about whether or not it is justified

2098
01:32:18,108 --> 01:32:20,688
to do this to these innocent beings.

2099
01:32:20,688 --> 01:32:23,568
The word humane slaughter,
what do you think of that word?

2100
01:32:23,568 --> 01:32:25,008
It's a non sequitur.

2101
01:32:25,008 --> 01:32:26,967
The two don't go together.

2102
01:32:26,967 --> 01:32:27,978
You can't treat someone humane

2103
01:32:27,978 --> 01:32:29,868
and then slaughter them, you know?

2104
01:32:29,868 --> 01:32:32,360
Well, how can it be humane if it's a slaughter,

2105
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:34,638
that's impossible.

2106
01:32:34,638 --> 01:32:35,718
They don't go together.

2107
01:32:35,718 --> 01:32:37,218
Come on.

2108
01:32:37,218 --> 01:32:41,118
That's just another way to pull the wool over our eyes.

2109
01:32:41,118 --> 01:32:43,668
It's all about finance.

2110
01:32:43,668 --> 01:32:45,888
So the word humane means to show compassion,

2111
01:32:45,888 --> 01:32:48,168
kindness, or benevolence.

2112
01:32:48,168 --> 01:32:50,358
How can you be kind to an animal

2113
01:32:50,358 --> 01:32:52,908
when you are robbing them of their existence?

2114
01:32:52,908 --> 01:32:54,978
Animals have a desire to live.

2115
01:32:54,978 --> 01:32:57,228
They want to continue their experience.

2116
01:32:57,228 --> 01:33:01,218
And whenever you are thinking about what's humane,

2117
01:33:01,218 --> 01:33:02,208
what's not humane,

2118
01:33:02,208 --> 01:33:04,398
try to put yourself in the victim's position.

2119
01:33:04,398 --> 01:33:07,608
If you didn't feel any pain before you were killed,

2120
01:33:07,608 --> 01:33:10,158
would it be morally acceptable to kill you?

2121
01:33:10,158 --> 01:33:12,558
That's a question people have to ask themselves.

2122
01:33:12,558 --> 01:33:17,088
And especially for something as trivial as a flavor.

2123
01:33:17,088 --> 01:33:21,828
Ask yourself this, is the fleeting satisfaction,

2124
01:33:21,828 --> 01:33:25,038
the fleeting taste pleasure
you get from eating an animal

2125
01:33:25,038 --> 01:33:28,638
worth more to you than an animal's entire existence

2126
01:33:28,638 --> 01:33:30,498
is worth to them.

2127
01:33:30,498 --> 01:33:32,088
You have to weigh that up.

2128
01:33:32,088 --> 01:33:34,758
I don't think there's any
such thing as humane slaughter.

2129
01:33:34,758 --> 01:33:38,448
Those animals do not want to die.

2130
01:33:38,448 --> 01:33:42,228
They are full of life, and curiosity,

2131
01:33:42,228 --> 01:33:46,218
emotionally sensitive beings
who want to explore the world.

2132
01:33:46,218 --> 01:33:48,228
How can something be humane

2133
01:33:48,228 --> 01:33:50,838
when you are taking from an animal

2134
01:33:50,838 --> 01:33:54,378
the thing that is the most precious to any animal,

2135
01:33:54,378 --> 01:33:56,883
including us, is our life?

2136
01:33:57,870 --> 01:33:59,628
Humane Slaughter Association.

2137
01:33:59,628 --> 01:34:00,461
What a joke.

2138
01:34:00,461 --> 01:34:02,148
There is no such thing.

2139
01:34:02,148 --> 01:34:05,898
It's us trying to fool ourselves that we can be kind

2140
01:34:05,898 --> 01:34:10,833
to animals by killing them,
by actually taking their life.

2141
01:34:13,620 --> 01:34:15,378
This decision isn't about survival.

2142
01:34:15,378 --> 01:34:17,448
This isn't life or death, it is for the animals.

2143
01:34:17,448 --> 01:34:18,498
But it's really just a choice

2144
01:34:18,498 --> 01:34:21,708
of changing to a plant-based product for us.

2145
01:34:21,708 --> 01:34:23,058
And just because we've done something

2146
01:34:23,058 --> 01:34:24,918
for a long period of time,

2147
01:34:24,918 --> 01:34:26,628
that doesn't mean we should continue to do it.

2148
01:34:26,628 --> 01:34:27,918
There's a lot of bad things

2149
01:34:27,918 --> 01:34:29,448
that have happened throughout history

2150
01:34:29,448 --> 01:34:31,818
and just because they're part of traditions

2151
01:34:31,818 --> 01:34:33,948
or have been passed down through generations,

2152
01:34:33,948 --> 01:34:36,228
that doesn't mean we have a moral justification

2153
01:34:36,228 --> 01:34:37,638
to continue doing them.

2154
01:34:37,638 --> 01:34:40,308
Just as we believe that all humans deserve

2155
01:34:40,308 --> 01:34:44,268
to be treated with dignity, respect, and compassion,

2156
01:34:44,268 --> 01:34:45,438
we should also extend

2157
01:34:45,438 --> 01:34:47,793
that same moral consideration to animals.

2158
01:34:48,690 --> 01:34:51,168
All sentient beings, no matter their species

2159
01:34:51,168 --> 01:34:54,708
deserve to have rights
protecting them from enslavement,

2160
01:34:54,708 --> 01:34:57,768
exploitation, abuse, and murder.

2161
01:34:57,768 --> 01:34:58,643
You're here.

2162
01:35:00,142 --> 01:35:00,933
Come on.

2163
01:35:00,933 --> 01:35:03,108
So immediately after I rescued
the piggies from the farm,

2164
01:35:03,108 --> 01:35:05,598
we took them straight away to a safe place.

2165
01:35:05,598 --> 01:35:08,268
Awaiting them was basically a new home

2166
01:35:08,268 --> 01:35:09,678
where they could be with their own kind

2167
01:35:09,678 --> 01:35:12,168
and they can just live out their lives

2168
01:35:12,168 --> 01:35:14,568
and do all the things pigs love to do,

2169
01:35:14,568 --> 01:35:16,608
nuzzle in the ground, and play with hay,

2170
01:35:16,608 --> 01:35:18,978
and eat all the lovely foods.

2171
01:35:18,978 --> 01:35:22,308
So yeah, it was a very wholesome moment.

2172
01:35:22,308 --> 01:35:23,183
There you go.

2173
01:35:24,863 --> 01:35:25,956
There you go.

2174
01:35:25,956 --> 01:35:29,165
(inspirational music)

2175
01:35:30,810 --> 01:35:31,803
Just like a puppy.

2176
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:37,428
I feel you never see what's wrong with it

2177
01:35:37,428 --> 01:35:40,458
until you see it and witness it.

2178
01:35:40,458 --> 01:35:45,500
And I would've never have
thought I would've been a vegan.

2179
01:35:46,110 --> 01:35:47,778
It never crossed my mind.

2180
01:35:47,778 --> 01:35:50,613
My parents and nobody I know is, really.

2181
01:35:51,612 --> 01:35:54,471
But that turned me,

2182
01:35:54,471 --> 01:35:57,048
that turned me the complete opposite way.

2183
01:35:57,048 --> 01:35:59,430
No longer eat meat at all.

2184
01:36:01,947 --> 01:36:04,788
And witness what I've witnessed it isn't a nice thing

2185
01:36:04,788 --> 01:36:06,078
and I wouldn't wish that on anybody

2186
01:36:06,078 --> 01:36:07,278
to witness what I've witnessed.

2187
01:36:07,278 --> 01:36:10,893
But I feel people do need to
realize what we're consuming,

2188
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:13,878
[Joey] So three months
after I'd rescued the two piglets,

2189
01:36:13,878 --> 01:36:16,720
we visited the animal sanctuary
that was now their home.

2190
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:20,418
They had a surrogate mother

2191
01:36:20,418 --> 01:36:22,493
and they were free to run around and play.

2192
01:36:23,694 --> 01:36:25,068
[Tarion] It's so funny.

2193
01:36:25,068 --> 01:36:26,478
Can we think for ourselves

2194
01:36:26,478 --> 01:36:29,838
and actually think, okay, yeah,
we've been doing it this way

2195
01:36:29,838 --> 01:36:34,189
for a while, but actually we are healthier as a vegan.

2196
01:36:34,189 --> 01:36:36,468
We have a chance to save the planet,

2197
01:36:36,468 --> 01:36:37,968
reduce greenhouse gas emissions,

2198
01:36:37,968 --> 01:36:40,847
reduce wildlife extinctions by going vegan.

2199
01:36:40,847 --> 01:36:43,788
And we don't have to actually
kill these creatures at all

2200
01:36:43,788 --> 01:36:48,078
and put them through this absolute torture

2201
01:36:48,078 --> 01:36:49,998
because by far the most cruelty

2202
01:36:49,998 --> 01:36:51,348
that's committed in the UK

2203
01:36:51,348 --> 01:36:54,108
is to farmed animals by a million miles.

2204
01:36:54,108 --> 01:36:55,518
If I was gonna eat that hot dog

2205
01:36:55,518 --> 01:36:58,101
that I just ate in a cinema and you came and told me

2206
01:36:58,101 --> 01:37:01,098
that this hot dog here, gas chamber is mad,

2207
01:37:01,098 --> 01:37:02,350
I would've put it down.

2208
01:37:03,313 --> 01:37:05,478
It's just, that's wrong.

2209
01:37:05,478 --> 01:37:07,263
I would actually come on,

2210
01:37:08,169 --> 01:37:11,343
I'd come and stand outside and say, stop.

2211
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:13,728
Yeah, seriously.

2212
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:18,468
I think I've realized for
myself that I couldn't expect

2213
01:37:18,468 --> 01:37:21,108
the industry to do the right thing.

2214
01:37:21,108 --> 01:37:25,248
I couldn't expect the government
to do anything about it.

2215
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:28,938
I raised all these concerns and nothing changed.

2216
01:37:28,938 --> 01:37:30,588
I was in that industry for four years

2217
01:37:30,588 --> 01:37:33,318
solely with the purpose of improving welfare.

2218
01:37:33,318 --> 01:37:35,613
And I couldn't change anything.

2219
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:39,828
So I think consumers mustn't rely

2220
01:37:39,828 --> 01:37:43,998
on any sort of welfare improvements coming

2221
01:37:43,998 --> 01:37:45,228
further down the line.

2222
01:37:45,228 --> 01:37:47,658
It is really, truly horrific.

2223
01:37:47,658 --> 01:37:50,628
And I don't know how to word that seriously enough

2224
01:37:50,628 --> 01:37:54,438
like it is, I've got such a bit of PTSD

2225
01:37:54,438 --> 01:37:56,430
from what I had to do in that industry.

2226
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:02,568
And I think the only solution
is to not buy into it at all.

2227
01:38:02,568 --> 01:38:06,048
Do not fund any of these industries

2228
01:38:06,048 --> 01:38:09,003
that are exploiting sentient beings.

2229
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:14,208
Based on my experience,
it's very clear that the industry

2230
01:38:14,208 --> 01:38:16,818
and the government won't make this change for us.

2231
01:38:16,818 --> 01:38:19,068
Not while there's this much money involved.

2232
01:38:19,068 --> 01:38:20,115
So the people at home

2233
01:38:20,115 --> 01:38:22,338
and the people who are buying these products

2234
01:38:22,338 --> 01:38:23,178
really have to realize

2235
01:38:23,178 --> 01:38:25,428
that the power really is in their hands.

2236
01:38:25,428 --> 01:38:26,568
The power is in their hands.

2237
01:38:26,568 --> 01:38:29,598
So much so that if everyone in the UK

2238
01:38:29,598 --> 01:38:31,758
and the world stopped buying these products,

2239
01:38:31,758 --> 01:38:33,948
slaughterhouse would no longer exist.

2240
01:38:33,948 --> 01:38:36,138
'Cause there would be no reason for them to.

2241
01:38:36,138 --> 01:38:38,838
So if every single individual had the mindset

2242
01:38:38,838 --> 01:38:41,448
that together we can make a difference,

2243
01:38:41,448 --> 01:38:45,067
then they can realize really
the power is in their hands.

2244
01:38:45,067 --> 01:38:47,692
(somber music)

2245
01:39:18,061 --> 01:39:20,811
(pigs squealing)

2246
01:39:27,622 --> 01:39:30,048
(sheep bleating)

2247
01:39:30,048 --> 01:39:32,673
(pig chomping)

2248
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:37,008
So there's been some huge breaking news.

2249
01:39:37,008 --> 01:39:39,798
Pilgrim's have announced
that they'll be closing down

2250
01:39:39,798 --> 01:39:41,448
their Manchester gas chamber.

2251
01:39:41,448 --> 01:39:43,668
This comes just two weeks after we released

2252
01:39:43,668 --> 01:39:44,928
the footage on social media,

2253
01:39:44,928 --> 01:39:46,758
which garnered over 2 million views

2254
01:39:46,758 --> 01:39:48,858
and made national news headlines.

2255
01:39:48,858 --> 01:39:49,938
We actually did it.

2256
01:39:49,938 --> 01:39:50,988
We shut 'em down.

2257
01:39:50,988 --> 01:39:52,829
But that's not the end of it.

2258
01:39:52,829 --> 01:39:55,398
There are still gas chambers
all over the UK and the world.

2259
01:39:55,398 --> 01:39:59,101
Although we've won the battle, the war is far from over.

2260
01:39:59,101 --> 01:40:02,310
(inspirational music)

2261
01:40:49,582 --> 01:40:52,249
(gentle music)
