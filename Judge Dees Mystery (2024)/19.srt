[Based on the novel of the same name
by the Dutch author Robert van Gulik]

00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:46,980
[Episode 19]

4
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,980
[This is a work of fiction.
Any resemblance is purely coincidental.]

5
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:59,160
Oyez.

6
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,070
Who are you?

7
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,440
I am Han Yongnan.

8
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,400
I live in the eastern suburbs
of Lanfang County.

9
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,040
I am the owner of a silver mine.

10
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,240
On the 27th day of the tenth month
of the first year of Linde,

11
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,720
that is, the day before yesterday,

12
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,000
my friends and I

13
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,920
were feasting in my house.

14
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,280
In order to add to the fun,

15
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,920
we indulged in dallying
with some prostitutes.

16
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,400
However,

17
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,840
I'm accused of rape

18
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,880
by ill-intentioned people.

19
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,880
[Han Yongnan]
I'm really wronged.

20
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,160
Dallying with prostitutes?

21
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,280
Zhao Wangrui

22
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,840
is under age.

23
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,480
[Miss Jin]
Her mother Miss Jin

24
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,800
works as a maid in your mansion.

25
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,680
Since there was a feast in the mansion,

26
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,680
you were short of hands.

27
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,720
Miss Jin

28
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,560
asked her daughter

29
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,240
to go to your mansion to help.

30
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,960
You scoundrels

31
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,160
raped her daughter

32
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,360
after drinking.

33
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,000
Han Yongnan.

34
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:48,880
Yes.

35
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,000
Do you admit it?

36
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,240
Magistrate,

37
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,200
this place is not the capital.

38
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,400
In Lanfang County,

39
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,520
many girls

40
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,040
have been abandoned
since they were born.

41
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,480
Rather than let her starve to death
in the wilderness,

42
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,280
it's better

43
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,160
to find a good partner

44
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,880
when she is young and beautiful.

45
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,960
That's a way out.

46
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,640
Nonsense!

47
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,800
According to the law of Tang,

48
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,520
if a woman is unwilling,

49
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,640
it is considered rape.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,320
How can you judge

51
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,560
if she is willing?

52
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,040
You can't get an answer

53
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,080
from the girl.

54
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:19,760
But

55
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,440
her mother agreed.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Magistrate,

57
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,360
I didn't pay them a penny less.

58
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,560
Miss Jin,

59
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,560
you can't slander me

60
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,880
after taking my money.

61
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,400
I didn't take your money.

62
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,680
Magistrate,

63
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,840
I have evidence.

64
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,040
This is the purchase contract.

65
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,080
Miss Jin's fingerprint is on it.

66
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,320
Give it to Miss Jin.

67
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,160
Is the fingerprint

68
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,840
on the purchase contract yours?

69
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:09,960
Magistrate,

70
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:10,920
I...

71
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,840
I am illiterate.

72
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,960
How dare you?

73
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,440
Miss Jin is illiterate.

74
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,800
How could she know

75
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,840
what contract she was signing?

76
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,840
Qiao Tai,

77
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,160
did you find anything

78
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,600
in Miss Jin's house?

79
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,640
Magistrate,

80
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,720
in Miss Jin's room,

81
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,760
there is indeed 3,000 qian.

82
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,360
No, Magistrate.

83
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,880
No.

84
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,280
Magistrate,

85
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,280
if you want to ask

86
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,120
what happened

87
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,520
that night,

88
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,480
being in this court,

89
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,960
I can only tell you one thing.

90
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,400
Now there is something

91
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,080
called Five Stone Powder in the capital.

92
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,680
After you take it,

93
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,040
the fun will double

94
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,600
and you'll feel like in heaven.

95
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,640
You can't describe

96
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,160
that kind of feeling in words.

97
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,160
If you are interested,

98
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,360
I'll find a day...

99
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:12,800
How dare you?

100
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:13,920
Ma Rong.

101
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,720

102
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,720
Magistrate,

103
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,120
you caught me

104
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,520
yesterday.

105
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,000
It's been

106
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,120
24 hours now.

107
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,120
I know something about the law of Tang.

108
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,120
If there is

109
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,360
no conviction,

110
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
the maximum detention time

111
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,040
cannot exceed 24 hours.

112
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,440
Magistrate,

113
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,800
ever since you took office,

114
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,040
you've been following the law of Tang.

115
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,360
You can't break your rules

116
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,920
just because of what she said.

117
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,800
The case of Han Yongnan

118
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,040
raping a girl

119
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,760
will be rescheduled

120
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,640
for lack

121
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,120
of evidence.

122
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,040
Han Yongnan

123
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,200
is released on bail pending trial.

124
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,000
During this period,

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,200
you can't leave

126
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,800

127
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,520
Leave the court.

[Lanfang County Magistrate's Office]

Bureaucrats shielding one another.

131
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,120
Exactly.

132
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,320
He is a villain.

133
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,840
Han Yongnan,

134
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,960
I'll kill you!

135
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,880
What are you doing?

136
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,360
Calm down.

137
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,480
The Magistrate will give you justice.

[Wangdong]
I'm Wangdong, Rui's elder brother.

139
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,240
He harmed my sister.

140
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,640
I can't let him off!

141
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,680
Don't let him off!

142
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,480
Don't let him off!

143
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,360
I'm not guilty.

144
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,120
Stop shouting!

145
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,160
The law can't even convict me.

146
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,360
Who are you guys?

147
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,560
Stop shouting!

in broad daylight...

150
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,080
Let go!

151
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,920
He committed physical assault.

152
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,120
You can't just

153
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:41,960
let it go like that.

154
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:45,880
Magistrate,

155
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,520
please give us justice.

156
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,960
Avenge my sister!

157
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,880
This boy committed physical assault
on the street.

158
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,920
Take him into custody.

159

Magistrate.

160
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,000
What kind of magistrate are you?

161
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,280
Why standing there? Take him away.

162
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,800
You are just a corrupt official!

163
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,480
Corrupt official!

164
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,360
Go.

165
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,840
There is no reason

166
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,280
for the wicked to go unpunished.

167
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,000
Corrupt official!

168
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,360
Corrupt official!

169
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,880
Corrupt official!

170
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,000
Magistrate,

171
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,080
I also grew up in Chang'an

172
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,240
since I was a child.

173
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,280
After all,

174
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,480
we can understand

175
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,440
each other.

176
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,040
We aren't like them.

177
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,000
If you don't mind,

178
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,320
please come

179
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,960
to my mansion

180
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
to have a drink this evening.

181
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,760
Let's have a good talk.

182
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,920
Goodbye.

183
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,080
Lecher!

Magistrate.

186
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,920
Magistrate,

187
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,320
you released Han Yongnan

188
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,040
and took Rui's brother into custody.

189
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,720
Can't you tell

190
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,320
the good from the bad?

191
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,680
The Magistrate didn't want to release him.

192
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,440
It's just that there is no reason
to detain him.

193
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,240
Mr. Hong,

194
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,640
we can't care

195
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,480
about all those rules now.

196
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,960
Can't you see the situation

197
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,080
in Rui's family?

198
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,760
Isn't she miserable enough?

199
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,600
Then why did you block
the hurt of a knife for him?

200
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,240
Because you work for the government.

201
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,880
You know

202
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,200
you should abide by the laws.

203
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,600
I said

204
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,680
I would raise

205
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,280
the flag of law in Lanfang County.

206
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,920
No one

207
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
should let reason

208
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,880
outweigh legal reason at any time.

209
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,960
Wangdong committed physical assault

210
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,520
in broad daylight.

211
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,320
He should be taken into custody
according to the law.

212
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,840
The evidence is inadequate.

213
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,360
Han Yongnan

214
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,120
should be released according to the law.

215
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,920
Understand me?

216
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,920
I can't win the argument with you.

217
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,080
I've worked with you for so many years.

218
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,800
I've never seen you look so weak.

219
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,880
Do you also have something to say?

220
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,240
No.

221
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:22,880
Follow me.

222
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,400
Give me all the files

223
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,080
related to Han Yongnan's case.

224
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,320
Mr. Hong

225
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,080
asked someone to bring back

226
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,720
this year's new tea from Luoyang.

227
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,160
I'll make you a pot of tea.

228
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,320
This man is Yun Gang
from Chongshan Ward.

229
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,640
He is a famous lecher in Lanfang County.

230
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,960
He deceived and afflicted
countless girls and young women.

231
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,600
A few days ago,

232
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,320
a woman just hung herself

233
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,880
because she was pregnant with his baby.

234
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:41,760
Look.

235
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,400
Today, his corpse

236
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,400
appeared outside the city.

237
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,120
Another murder for hire.

238
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,080
The third one in this month.

239
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,160
It must be the parents
of the woman who hung herself

240
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,880
or her husband's family.

241
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,280
If they hired a killer,

242
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,320
you can catch them and interrogate them.

243
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,120
No evidence, no witnesses.

244
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,080
Now this corpse

245
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,680
just proves that it was a murder for hire.

246
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,920
You can't blame anyone.

247
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,560
Look,

248
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,360
it's so easy to take revenge.

249
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,680
Now people would rather pay someone

250
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,600
to settle their scores.

251
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,440
But those who were killed
were not innocent.

252
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,520
Who can be the murderer?

253
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,360
This man has a ruthless way

254
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,080
of killing people.

255
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,200
The murders seem to be done
by the same person.

256
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,560
If the Magistrate can bring
all the murderers

257
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,920
and scumbags like Han Yongnan

258
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
to justice,

259
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,920
there will be no more grievances

260
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,200
or suffering in Lanfang County.

261
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,800
If there are no more grievances

262
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,080
or suffering,

263
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,520
this can only happen after death

264
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,000
not in Lanfang County.

265
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,040
Most of us are ordinary people.

266
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,960
To be an ordinary man is to be selfish.

267
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,680
The law

268
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,320
is also made by ordinary people.

269
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,840
Nothing is omnipotent.

270
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,280
Mr. Hong,

271
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,240
I don't understand this.

272
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,160
Now that the law

273
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,520
is made by ordinary people,

274
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,000
why does the Magistrate

275
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,480
insist on following it?

276
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,640
He has good reason

277
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,720
for his insistence.

278
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,840
We just have to cooperate with him.

279
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,120
How did your investigation
into the relationship

280
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,640
between Qian Hao and Heiyan go?

281
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:40,960
Except for Qian Hao,

282
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,800
no one in the Black Tiger Gang

283
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,240
knows anything about Heiyan.

284
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,640
Not even his closest associates

285
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,480
have seen him communicate with anyone.

286
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,440
It feels like the Black Tiger Gang

287
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,560
only works for themselves.

288
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,680
Was Qian Hao a member of Heiyan before?

289
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,840
Later, Heiyan disbanded.

290
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,680
He organized the Black Tiger Gang himself?

291
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,360
He could have slipped through the cracks.

292
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,040
We've been here
for more than six months.

293
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,920
But we only saw

294
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,280
the marks he left.

295
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,040
Have you investigated the 3,000 qian?

296
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,160
Such a large amount of money.

297
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,240
Who sent it to the Jin's? When?

298
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,720
You may find something

299
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,160
from these details.

300
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,960
I clearly know Rui was harmed
by Han Yongnan.

301
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,680
Miss Jin is totally illiterate.

302
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,200
It's obvious she was forced

303
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,240
to sign the contract.

304
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,200
I clearly know Wangdong

305
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,120
was extremely indignant.

306
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,160
If I were

307
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,240
young and impulsive,

308
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,800
I would do the same.

309
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,920
But what could I do?

310
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,640
To release Han Yongnan

311
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,040
was the only thing I could do.

312
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,480
No one in this world

313
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,400
has the right

314
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,120
to take the life of another.

315
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,440
Han Yongnan has no right.

316
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,840
Vice versa.

317
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,280
Before he is brought to justice,

318
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,640
keeping Wangdong
in the Magistrate's Office

319
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,360
is the best protection for him.

320
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,040
You are not wrong.

321
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,560
I think as time goes on

322
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,840
with this case,

323
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,040
you will come to a conclusion.

324
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,680
Take a look

325
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,160
at these cases.

326
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,480
I'm afraid

327
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,760
you might miss something.

328
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,120
All are missing person cases.

329
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,080
The age, gender,

330
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,760
and time of disappearance

331
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,000
of the missing persons

332
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,720
are all irregular.

333
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,880
But if you look
at their household registrations,

334
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,200
they are all from a village
near the silver mine

335
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,600
in the suburbs of Lanfang County.

336
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,280
Liushui?

337
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,120
The Jin family also lives there.

338
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,640
Because of the silver mine,

339
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,800
these villages have lost their crops

340
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,000
in recent years.

341
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,600
Nothing grows on the land.

342
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,360
Maybe they have detached

343
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,880
from their household registrations

344
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,680
to survive.

345
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,320
Even if they did that,

346
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,640
I will investigate it clearly.

347
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,080
Open the door.

348
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:15,920
Yes.

349
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,480
Are you hungry?

350
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,240
Have some.

351
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,600
Stop glaring at me.

352
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,160
Your eyes are about to drop out.

353
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,480
Corrupt official.

354
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm not an official.

355
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,960
I'm just here to make a living.

356
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,600
I hurt you just now.

357
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,760
You hate a man so much

358
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,080
that you can't wait to kill him.

359
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,040
Did you kill the man?

360
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,400
I'll tell you after you eat the flatbread.

361
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,640
Magistrate.

362
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:23,960
Magistrate.

363
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,760
I just asked them.

364
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,960
You will be released
early in the morning tomorrow.

365
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,080
After you go back,

366
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,840
if you still want to take revenge
on Han Yongnan,

367
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,920
I can't see it this time.

368
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,160
I won't interfere.

369
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,320
Okay?

370
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,400
Impossible.

371
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,560
He has many guards at his silver mine.

372
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,760
There are also ferocious dogs.

373
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,480
I can't get in there.

374
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,590
Don't worry.

375
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,240
Magistrate Di

376
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,720
will avenge you.

377
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,480
He is the best man I've ever seen.

378
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,240
Why did he release Han Yongnan today?

379
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,310
The evidence is inadequate.

380
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,960
Do you need evidence to punish a bad guy?

381
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,520
No.

382
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,040
You need evidence for everything.

383
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
You say he killed someone,

384
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,310
but he says he didn't.

385
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,840
Who should we believe?

386
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,200
If we can catch or kill someone

387
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,760
without evidence,

388
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,720
what's the difference
between us and a gang?

389
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,360
If the government is so indiscriminate,

390
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,520
it's worse than Heiyan.

391
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,280
How did you know Heiyan?

392
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,000
I've heard the legend.

393
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,400
What legend?

394
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,400
People say

395
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,880
when Heiyan was here,

396
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,240
people were afraid to break the law.

397
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,760
Because Heiyan

398
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,120
would not just work for those
who were rich and powerful

399
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,920
or those scholars
who confused right and wrong.

400
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,200
Even if we had no money,

401
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,440
as long as we joined them,

402
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,520
they would help us get rid of the people

403
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,920
who hurt us.

404
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,120
They are talking nonsense.

405
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,160
Who told you this?

406
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,600
You are still siding
with the corrupt official.

407
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,680
Heiyan is better than you.

408
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,160
Brat, you piss me off!

409
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,200
Whatever, I'm done with you.

410
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,640
Take it.

411
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,720
Ma Rong,

412
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,240
come out!

413
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,440
Corrupt official!

414
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,120
Take out the knife.

415
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:31,680
Corrupt official,

416
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,920
let me out!

417
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,880
Corrupt official,

418
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,720
let me out!

419
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:42,920
Corrupt official!

420
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,320
Why are you looking at me?

421
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,800
Punish me if you want.

422
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,080
I'm just not convinced.

423
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,080
Why?

424
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,920
Why is it always the good guys who lose?

425
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,360
Why are you such a coward today?

426
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,120
When facing Han Yongnan,

427
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,560
you couldn't say anything.

428
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,840
You worked so hard to be an official.

429
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,080
Why did you end up
being called a corrupt official?

430
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,680
Since you said

431
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,800
that we can't conclude a case

432
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,880
without evidence,

433
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,480
I won't punish you this time.

434
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,560
Release him

435
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,040
tomorrow.

436
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,680
Okay.

437
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,760
The two dead women

438
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,480
were both singsong girls
in the entertainment house in the city.

439
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,000
They were taken here last night.

440
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,440
Go find the butler.

441
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,160
Now there is something

442
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,640
called Five Stone Powder

443
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,160
in the capital.

444
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,800
After you take it,

445
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,200
the fun will double

446
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,000
and you'll feel like in heaven.

447
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,840
Are you okay?

448
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,640
How are you doing?

449
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,080
Nice!

450
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,680
Let go of her!

451
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,480
Arrest

452
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,800
Han Yongnan.

453
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,880
Yes.

454
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,740
[Lanfang County Magistrate's Office]

455
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,440
Under such circumstances,

456
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,760
Master doesn't let us disturb him.

457
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,640
We dare not ask anything.

458
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,200
Does he take that drug

459
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,360
every time he takes girls back?

460
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,240
The drug

461
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,920
was brought back from the capital.

462
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,440
It's not always available.

463
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,560
At times, maybe.

464
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,880
Animal!

465
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,080
At the hour of Mao,

466
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,240
the maid

467
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,200
who brought tea to Master

468
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,240
discovered their bodies.

469
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,440
It's her.

470
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,760
What did you discover

471
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,160
when you brought tea to your master?

472
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,080
Magistrate,

473
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,480
she can't talk.

474
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,400
She is a mute.

475
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,000
You really didn't see Han Yongnan?

476
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,200
No.

477
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,960
I dare not deceive you.

478
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,680
You saw it yourself.

479
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,160
All the horses in the stable

480
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,240
are there.

481
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,640
From last night

482
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,680
to this morning,

483
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,720
no one came in or out.

484
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,120
Magistrate,

485
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,320
people in the suburbs also confirmed

486
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,720
that Han Yongnan hadn't left the city.

487
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,160
An order for arrest has been issued.

488
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,080
He can't escape.

489
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,480
The silver mine is a restricted area.

490
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,080
You need a search warrant
from the state government to get in.

491
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,080
This is Mr. Di,
the magistrate of Lanfang County.

492
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,040
He has been appointed by His Majesty.

493
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,080
Open the gate.

494
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,200
Silver mines are the lifeblood
of the court.

495
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,720
We only recognize the seal
of the state government.

496
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,160
We now have every reason

497
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,480
to suspect that the silver mine
harbors a murderer.

498
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,680
Open the gate.

499
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,280
If you dare barge in,

500
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,480
don't blame us for being rude.

501
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,840
Han Yongnan,
the owner of the silver mine,

502
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,400
disguised himself and ran away
in a mining carriage.

503
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,800
If you saw the carriage
of the silver mine leaving today,

504
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,840
report to us quickly.

505
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,160
[Arrest Warrant]
Those who cover up

506
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,640
will be dealt with according to the law.

507
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,120
Take a look.

508
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,240
Did you see him today?

509
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:27,960
No.

510
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,840
I haven't seen him all day.

511
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,640
You didn't see him?

512
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,280
Are you sure you haven't seen him today?

513
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,120
You still let him escape.

514
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,680
What are you looking at?

515
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,640
What are you looking at?

516
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,200
Do you want to see her?

517
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:55,800
Come in.

518
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:19,880
See?

519
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,920
My sister is as good as dead now.

520
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,000
If you hadn't stopped me,

521
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,160
I would have killed him.

522
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,320
A life for a life.

523
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,440
I shouldn't have reported the case.

524
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,600
I should go to Heiyan directly.

525
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,040
Don't talk nonsense.

526
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,320
Let go of me!

527
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,400
You too.

528
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,200
Get lost!

529
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,480
Get lost!

530
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,040
You all get lost!

531
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,360
Get out!

532
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,200
And you,

533
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:51,800
get out!

534
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,400
He released him.

535
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,880
Bullying us commoners.

536
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,800
Corrupt official.

537
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,040
Really a corrupt official!

538
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,400
Please trust me.

539
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,560
I will catch Han Yongnan

540
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,480
and bring him to justice.

541
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,480
Leave us alone.

542
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,960
It's out of your hands.

543
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,960
Get lost!

544
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,040

Get lost!

Get lost!

550
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,800
Leave here!

Get lost!

557
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,680
Get lost, corrupt official!

Get lost!

562
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,320
There is no trace

563
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,000
of Han Yongnan in the city.

564
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:11,880
Magistrate,

565
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
where could he possibly go?

566
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,360
Magistrate,

567
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,120
it was confirmed

568
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,440
that a carriage of the silver mine

569
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,040
did leave the city
at the beginning of Mao hour.

570
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,160
It left at a fast speed.

571
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,120
On the carriage,

572
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,200
there was a man dressed like a stableman.

573
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,280
Left the city?

574
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,080
How could you let him leave?

575
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,760
Hasn't the arrest warrant
for Han Yongnan been issued?

576
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,680
His clothes and appearance

577
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,080
could not be linked to Han Yongnan.

578
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,800
There's no problem

579
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,880
with his identity papers.

580
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:35,960
Yesterday,

581
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,720
Han Yongnan was just released.

582
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,920
We really didn't expect it.

583
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,120
Please forgive us.

584
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,040
Get up.

585
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,680
Where was the carriage going?

586
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,680
Toward Liuli Post
in the west of the city.

587
00:30:54,900 --> 00:31:01,180
[Liuli Post]

588
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,600
Liuli Post should be right ahead.

589
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,600
Magistrate.

590
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,640
I...

591
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,720
I haven't finished my words yet.

592
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,480
The posthouse official of Liuli Post

593
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,640
can't be intimidated
by Han Yongnan, can he?

594
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,400
Magistrate,

595
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:05,960
someone has just left.

596
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,120
He never lets me finish my words.

597
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,560
I think

598
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,120
we should hide here.

599
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,800
It's a desert out there.

600
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,920
He has to ride you if he wants to leave.

601
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,440
If we hide here,

602
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,040
we can catch him off guard.

603
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,000
Good idea.

604
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,440
Han Yongnan?

605
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,480
What did you say to my horse?

606
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,440
Don't move.

607
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,000
With one wrong move,
my arrow could take your life!

608
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,880
Who are you?

609
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,640
Good.

610
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,240
Three to one.

611
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,720
Three people.

612
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:40,920
One bow.

613
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,360
If you kill me,

614
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,240
you will be cut into pieces.

615
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,920
Cut into pieces?

616
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,200
Who are you?

617
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,200
I'm not the one you are looking for.

618
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,760
How did you get the horse?

619
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,600
Who said that was my horse?

620
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,720
You can't get here without a horse.

621
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,360
You flew here?

622
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,720
Two hours ago, I exchanged horses

623
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,120
with a man.

624
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,440
Exchange horses?

625
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,120
Yes.

626
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,000
He looks very refined.

627
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,040
There is a mole on his eyelid.

628
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,120
Where did you exchange them?

629
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,320
You are pointing your sword at me.

630
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,840
I can't remember it.

631
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,600
How about this?

632
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,240
I'll count to three.

633
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,080
Let's put down our weapons then.

634
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,560
One,

635
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,680
two,

636
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,520
three.

637
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,040
Stop!

638
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,400
I trust him.

639
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:01,760
Magistrate.

640
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,160
Just now, he deliberately shot the arrow
in front of my feet.

641
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,040
Who are you?

642
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,400
My surname is Diao.

643
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,200
[Diao Xiaoguan]
My given name is Xiaoguan.

644
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,160
Let's have a chat.

645
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,200
If I'd known this guy was a sleazy guy,

646
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,080
I should have

647
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,560
charged him more money.

648
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,800
Get to the point.

649
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,840
Two hours ago...

650
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,520
Now it should be three hours ago.

651
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,680
He was heading for Yiwu County.

652
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,200
Even if we ride as fast as we can,

653
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,960
it will take us a day
to catch up with him.

654
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,160
Us?

655
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,800
I have to get my horse back.

656
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,760
I can't let such a guy ride it.

657
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,360
I don't need you to go with us.

658
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,480
I'll buy this horse.

659
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,480
You can go.

660
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,230
Okay.

661
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,190
I can sell you the horse.

662
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,150
But can you tell me

663
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,670
your name?

664
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,280
My surname is Di.

665
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,360
The surname is Di?

666
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,480
What about your first name?

667
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,230
You have to keep it a secret?

668
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,840
Could it be Daguan?
[*Corresponding to the name Xiaoguan]

669
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,800
Daguan,

670
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,760
don't you think this posthouse is weird?

671
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,800
Sir,

672
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:46,760
some people have come.

673
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,600
They must be hiding something in there.

674
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,000
Magistrate Di.

675
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,280
Magistrate, you've come from afar.

676
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,200
I should have welcomed you earlier.

677
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,000
It's my fault.

678
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,320
You know me?

679
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,040
My surname is Pang.

680
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:02,960
[Mr. Pang, the posthouse official]
I live in Lanfang County.

681
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,840
I'm just

682
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,960
working here.

683
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:06,680
Did you see

684
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,960
this man today?

685
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,800
No.

686
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:11,960
The posthouse

687
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,480
didn't receive anyone these days.

688
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,200
Magistrate,

689
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,120
please have some tea.

690
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:16,680
Wait.

691
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,040
What's in there?

692
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:21,720
Nothing.

693
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,440
We just hunted two deer a few days ago.

694
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,320
Qiao Tai.

695
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,160
Don't move.

696
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,680
Magistrate.

697
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,320
Really a high-ranking official.

698
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:13,720
Magistrate,

699
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,400
these are their indentures of sale

700
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,840
signed by their parents.

701
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,960
I'm not lying to you.

702
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,160
Magistrate,

703
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:19,840
I did not

704
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,720
violate the law of Tang.

705
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,160
You got a right
because you didn't break the law?

706
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,800
There are a lot of merchants
coming and going at the border.

707
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,640
I'm just

708
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,880
pocketing the difference.

709
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,800
As for how they would use the girls,

710
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,160
I never ask them.

711
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,360
If a good family

712
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,160
can adopt the girl,

713
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,840
isn't it a good thing?

714
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,360
Nonsense!

715
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,120
Ma Rong.

716
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,560
If you go on talking,
I'll cut your balls.

717
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,600
Magistrate,

718
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,640
I didn't violate the law.

719
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,440
I didn't violate the law, Magistrate.

720
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:42,800
Ma Rong,

721
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
he really didn't break the law of Tang.

722
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,320
I can't catch him.

723
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,840
I will buy

724
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,480
these girls.

725
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,960
Don't traffic people again.

726
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,520
I won't.

727
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,440
Otherwise,

728
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,240
I won't spare you.

729
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,200
Ma Rong,

730
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,320
give me your money.

731
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,640
I know nothing about the law.

732
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,000
But I have a conscience.

733
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,200
When you are on the way,

734
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,800
hold on to each other's clothes.

735
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,960
Don't get separated.

736
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,120
Make sure the girls

737
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,160
are safely returned to the city.

738
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,960
Come to me with the city defense.

739
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,520
What are you doing?

740
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,080
Okay.

741
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,520
Are you crazy?

742
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,000
Kill them!

743
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,880
Kill them!

744
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:17,760
Magistrate.

745
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:18,760
Let's go.

746
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,520
The bandits are coming.

747
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,680
Hide now.

748
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,440
The bandits are coming.

749
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,000
Go hide now.

750
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,640
Close the gate quickly.

751
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,360
Don't come here. Find a place yourself.

752
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,480
Jerk!

753
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,400
Airhead, you'll die in vain.

754
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:00,960
Kill them!

755
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:09,840
Magistrate!
