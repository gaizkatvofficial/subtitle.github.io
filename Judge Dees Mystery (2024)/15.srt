[Zhong's]

00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,960
Magistrate.

8
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,880
Please check this for me.

9
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,160
A dagger?

10
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,880
When was it?

11
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,080
On the day when Mr. Zhong was killed.

12
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,360
It must be after the shop was closed.

13
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,880
Mr. Zhong handled this deal himself.

14
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,880
This is his writing. I can recognize it.

15
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,200
On that day,

16
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,120
after the shop was closed,

17
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,880
apart from Mr. Zhong,

18
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,920
were there other people in the shop?

19
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,240
Shopkeeper Lin.

20
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,040
Where is Shopkeeper Lin?

21
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,360
He is in Mr. Zhong's room.

22
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,320
I remember when I was little,

23
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,800
I saved a bird

24
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,360
in my hometown.

25
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,240
After I saved it,

26
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,920
I wanted it to live a better life.

27
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,160
I bought it the best cage.

28
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,920
I let it drink the cleanest water

29
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,560
and eat the best food.

30
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,400
I thought

31
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,920
in this way,

32
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,040
it would be safer

33
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,440
and more comfortable

34
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,560
than when it was outside.

35
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,080
But in the end, it still died.

36
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,240
My father told me

37
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,840
that the bird longed for freedom.

38
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,200
But it couldn't get it,

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,200
and eventually, it died of depression.

40
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,400
Are you leaving?

41
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,240
Magistrate.

42
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,960
The shop has been sold.

43
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,040
Mr. Zhong has passed away.

44
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,240
Zhong's Pawn Shop

45
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,240
would eventually disappear.

46
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,120
Since the pawn shop would disappear,

47
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,080
why would you still

48
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,160
keep these account books?

49
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,960
I might offend you.

50
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,840
But this

51
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,760
has nothing to do with you.

52
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,400
It even has nothing to do with Mr. Zhong.

53
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,480
It mainly

54
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,960
has something to do with me.

55
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,960
You cherish them?

56
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,400
It's been 20 years.

57
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,680
We kept all the account books
for the past 20 years.

58
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,320
What kind of people would come
to the pawn shop?

59
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,920
Greedy people.

60
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,880
People with financial difficulties

61
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,000
would pawn their family heirlooms.

62
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,960
Cash-strapped people

63
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,440
would trade jewelry

64
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,720
for cash.

65
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,160
Those people

66
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,480
were very interesting.

67
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,440
They were

68
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,000
either ashamed to speak out

69
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,640
or greedy for property.

70
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,320
There were also people

71
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,440
who haggled over every penny.

72
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,960
I could at once...

73
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,920
Please excuse my behavior.

74
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,200
Why do you

75
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,240
come here today?

76
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,640
I want to ask you something.

77
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,000
Mr. Zhong

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,510
had someone he loved.

79
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,120
Do you know that?

80
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,800
He did?

81
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,920
A woman living in the marshland.

82
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,520
Very beautiful.

83
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,640
Mr. Zhong

84
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,520
loved her very much.

85
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,440
Beautiful?

86
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,760
So,

87
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,640
he was killed by that crazy woman.

88
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,520
What do you mean?

89
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
Sorry for my hasty conclusion.

90
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,640
Frankly,

91
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,560
no matter who Mr. Zhong loved,

92
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,640
or who killed him,

93
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,440
I don't care at all about these things.

94
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,400
A man who had been with you for 20 years

95
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,600
died.

96
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,840
You don't care at all?

97
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,200
What should I care about?

98
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,040
Care about

99
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,640
why he had turned into a Rain Master.

100
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,040
In the past six months,

101
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,200
Mr. Zhong

102
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,920
often looked spaced out.

103
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,560
He loved to go out on a rainy night.

104
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,760
Only children would believe
there is a Rain Master.

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,480
He could just fool that crazy woman.

106
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,880
Why should I care about it?

107
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,440
I need to care about the business
of the shop.

108
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,480
If I cared about all those

109
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,200
weird things like them,

110
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,640
our shop

111
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,720
would have long been closed down.

112
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,800
If I guessed it right,

113
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,800
on that afternoon,

114
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,800
there was a heated argument

115
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
between you and Mr. Zhong.

116
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,280
You hoped he could

117
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,960
stop doing those crazy things

118
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,720
and focus

119
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,120
on the business.

120
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,560
But he refused.

121
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,440
This world

122
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,560
has long destroyed me.

123
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,680
Only my Ying'er

124
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,760
never looks at me that way.

125
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,040
In her eyes,

126
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,400
there is only love

127
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,480
and admiration.

128
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,480
I feel the same for her.

129
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
Mr. Zhong,

130
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,400
wake up!

131
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,320
Are you sure whether she loves the mask

132
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,600
or the real you?

133
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,880
Mr. Zhong,

134
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,400
if one day

135
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,240
when you take off the mask

136
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,400
and stop being the Rain Master
who can only fool children,

137
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,080
will she still love you?

138
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,080
Mr. Zhong,

139
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,520
I beg you. Okay?

140
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,520
We finally got

141
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,000
to where we are today.

142
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
For a crazy woman...

143
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Don't call her that way

144
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,080
in front of me!

145
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,200
That's why

146
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,320
you killed Zhong Fang?

147
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,320
I

148
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,360
killed Mr. Zhong?

149
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,640
On that day,

150
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,680
those child soldiers
from the eighth camp

151
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,240
pawned that dagger

152
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,200
after the shop was closed.

153
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,440
I have to say,

154
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,560
you have successfully

155
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,400
shifted my attention

156
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,880
to those child soldiers
from the eighth camp.

157
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,360
What a wonderful story.

158
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,680
Magistrate Di,

159
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,640
you made me

160
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,520
the protagonist of this story.

161
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,160
I'm very honored.

162
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,960
But I'm

163
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,960
just a manager in this shop.

164
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,800
At most, I can be considered
a vice shopkeeper.

165
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,040
Why would I kill him?

166
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,040
Do you really consider yourself

167
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,200
merely a vice shopkeeper?

168
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,400
It's been 20 years.

169
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,480
You were with him,

170
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,880
starting from scratch.

171
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,560
From nothing

172
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,400
to building the pawn shop

173
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,440
to what it is today.

174
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,600
In the past 20 years,

175
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,280
you knew all accounts by heart.

176
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,000
You watched him

177
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,790
spending all the money

178
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,400
on a crazy woman.

179
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,400
Can you accept it?

180
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,200
No.

181
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,840
But what could I do?

182
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,240
He is the owner here.

183
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,720
Kill him.

184
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,960
Kill him,

185
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,480
and all the wealth here

186
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,760
would be yours.

187
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,760
All the...

188
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,240
wealth.

189
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,240
Magistrate Di,

190
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,080
do you know

191
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,200
what this shop

192
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,240
means to me?

193
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,520
No.

194
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,560
No.

195

You've come.

00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,640
I've come.

391
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,080
She has really come?

392
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,080
She is going to Lanfang County with us?

393
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,520
Let me go ask her.

394
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,080
What do you want to ask?

395
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,600
It's not your turn to ask.

396
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,880
What do you mean my turn...?

397
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,240
It is such an important matter.

398
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,760
She didn't make it clear to us,

399
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,120
yet she is going with us now?

400
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,080
Why?

401
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,360
They are doing very well.

We are back in the desert. Wonderful.

Comfortable.

409
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,080
Magistrate, do you still remember

410
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,760
how we met for the first time here?

411
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:15,840
Yes.

How long haven't you eaten?

417
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,000
Several days.

418
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,920
No work to do?

419
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,920
If we have work to do, we won't rob you.

420
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,760
Work for me from now on.

421
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:29,960
Okay.

If we hadn't been starving on that day,

423
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,240
we don't know what we would be today.

424
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,040
Magistrate, what are you looking at?

425
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,760
Yeah. What's the matter?

426
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,840

Magistrate,

471
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,600
the city defense team sent us
a letter today by a pigeon.

472
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,790
What's the matter?

473
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,790
The city defense team for the next shift
is also trapped by the sandstorm.

474
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,710
It will take them ten days to arrive.

476
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,640
you set off with Qiao Tai at once.

00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,160
Ride quickly and explore the way
into the city.

478
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,160
Let's meet at the city gate then.

479
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,270
Remember.

480
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,040
The city defense team hasn't arrived.
Be careful.

481
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,200
Yes.

482
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,560
I didn't expect

483
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,200
after the storm,

484
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,360
there would be such a quiet starry sky.

485
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,800
And

486
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,080
it is so close to us.

487
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,200
Indeed, I didn't expect

488
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,600
after the yellow sand dispersed
from the sky,

489
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,520
there would be a brilliant galaxy.

490
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,560
The desert has its own beauty.

491
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,160
But...

492
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,920
Do you have a load on your mind?

493
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,280
Today, in the desert,

494
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,280
I found a small peach wood sword

495
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,680
that I had kept for many years.

496
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,280
This small peach wood sword

497
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,920
means a lot

498
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,440
to me.

499
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,880
I don't believe that peach wood
can ward off evil spirits.

500
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,720
But by bringing it along,

501
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,480
I can always turn ill luck into good.

502
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,480
Today, I reunited with it.

503
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,400
Maybe it is trying to remind me

504
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,400
that Lanfang County

505
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,040
is a very dangerous place.

506
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,280
Are you scared?

507
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,640
I'm afraid you might suffer.

508
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,920
I don't believe that peach wood
can ward off evil spirits, either.

509
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,720
But I believe in you.

510
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:00,800
I believe,

511
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,760
no matter who it is,

512
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,080
you can face him calmly.
