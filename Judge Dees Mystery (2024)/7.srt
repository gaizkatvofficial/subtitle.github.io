5
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,600
You want me to be an official
or a villain?

6
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,160
I...

7
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,320
I...

8
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,400
I'll tell you.

9
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,960
I'll tell you...

10
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,360
Li Han has escaped.

11
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,640
He's a prisoner with shackles.

12
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,000
How could he escape

13
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,200
from your heavily guarded quarry?

14
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,120
Kill him.

15
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,750
No...

16
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,720
I released him...

17
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,240
Why did you do this?

18
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,600
Someone paid to release him.

19
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,200
Who?

20
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,680
I really don't know.

21
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,640
The person wore a long robe,

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,880
a bamboo hat

23
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,640
with a black veil.

24
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,520
The person didn't say a word,

25
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,600
just paid me

26
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,000
[Li Han]
and pointed at Li Han's name on the list.

27
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,680
I'm engaging in an offense punishable
by beheading.

28
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,760
Not asking for details also benefits me,

29
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,400
so I won't look into it.

30
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,560
So you're a repeat offender.

31
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,240
No...

32
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,310
It's a momentary lapse of judgment.

33
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,680
When did he leave?

34
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,600
Ten days ago.

35
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,000
But he's indeed

36
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,680
been suffering from leprosy.

37
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,680
That's not a lie.

38
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,720
Even if I don't let him go,

39
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,560
in a few days,

40
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,920
he'll be dead.

41
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:03,800
Qiao Tai.

42
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,720
You better watch out.

43
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,480
Someone will come to handle you later.

44
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,200
Magistrate,

45
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,840
you said before

46
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,440
that Li Han was sentenced
because of Yinlian's grudge.

47
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,920
And Li Han was released

48
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,760
before the unidentified body was found.

49
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,000
If the unidentified body is really Xu Kai

50
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,520
and there are similarities
between the two cases,

51
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,640
Li Han's motive to kill

52
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,680
because of his grudge will be confirmed.

53
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,520
Then the person who paid for his release

54
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,760
is probably his accomplice.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,440
You've improved a lot lately.

56
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,960
Based on the powder left
at the painting and calligraphy store,

57
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,960
the one who told us the body's identity

58
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,280
is also Li Han.

59
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,360
Now that I think about it,

60
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,160
Yinlian was out of fear at that time

61
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,480
because she recognized

62
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,560
that man was Li Han.

63
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,560
After returning to the city,
go to find a beggar.

64
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,680
Long hair and rags cover his face.

65
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,960
He's disabled because of leprosy

66
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,200
with an unique appearance.

67
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,840
Since his appearance is unique,

68
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,200
finding him shouldn't be hard.

69
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,760
It's time for me

70
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,360
to see Mrs. Yinlian's real face.

71
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,720
Real face?

72
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,240
This Mr. Bazong Ma Rong just met

73
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,880
is so powerful.

[Mingyue House]

75
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,680
Ms. Cao, Magistrate Di is here.

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay.

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,920
Magistrate,

78
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,720
sorry to keep you waiting.

79
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,640
That's all right.

80
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,560
Magistrate, I guess

81
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,240
you haven't rested for long.

82
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,480
I'm so confused,

83
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,880
so I can't fall asleep.

84
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,880
Is this about the murder of Mrs. Yinlian?

85
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,360
Yes.

86
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,880
This case

87
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,040
is very complicated.

88
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,640
It involves romantic entanglements.

89
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,520
And I still can't make sense of them.

90
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,720
I don't know how to start.

91
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,160
So you're not here to hear me sing.

92
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,440
Are you

93
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,520
asking for my help?

94
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,280
I think

95
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,200
you've experienced a lot of romance

96
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,880
and seen a lot.

97
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,760
A chat with you

98
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,270
may clear up my doubts.

99
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,400
Love and romance are simple.

100
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,600
It's strong while being together

101
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,000
and intense while missing.

102
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,320
Separation creates sorrow.

103
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,640
Infatuation creates suspicion.

104
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,680
Passionate creates jealousy and hatred.

105
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,320
In fact, these feelings

106
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,400
are depicted to the fullest

107
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,680
in Mr. Teng's poetry.

108
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,720
His poetry is soft and sentimental.

109
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,080
The feelings portrayed are more vivid

110
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,320
than an ordinary woman's thoughts.

111
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,280
I really don't get it.

112
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,200
Why don't

113
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,360
I play something for you?

114
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,880
Good.

115
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,440
Thank you.

Why do you always call him ''Di Renjie''?

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,080
Call him ''Magistrate''.

120

We're different now.

121

You have to know the rules.

123
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,080
you're becoming

124
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,040
more and more like Mr. Hong.

125
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,520
You're getting old.

126
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,160
You're so wild.

127
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,480
I'll see who dares to marry you.

128
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,720
Fine...

I'm waiting for Magistrate Di.

131
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,000
Okay?

132
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Then don't wait.

133
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,000

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,040
I don't know.

137
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,720
Then why are you talking to me?

138
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,520
Where are you going?

139

Stop minding me.

How could I stop minding you?

Come here.

143
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,960
Mr. Teng is too self-critical.

144
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,760
It's so worrying.

145
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,880
How is Mr. Teng?

Please go back.

Magistrate, you're just in time.

00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,560
Actually,

Master has been locked himself

159
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,880
in Madam's room for a whole day

160
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,160
without food or water.

161

- Madam's room?

Yes.

163

Mr. Teng and Mrs. Teng share
different rooms?

164

You don't know.

00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,240
In fact,

00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,480
I can wait.

176
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,240
Well...

177
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm here

178
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,880
to think of my late wife.

179
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,720
I don't want to be disturbed.

180
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,640
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

181
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,520
I beg your pardon for the inconvenience.

182
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,840
There are no outsiders here.

183
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,030
Just call me Huaiying.

184
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,520
Is this Mrs. Teng's work?

185
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
It's thick and delicate, just like her.

186
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,080
The old mountains stand,
yet my bonds no longer cling.

187
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,800
Embarking on a journey to Chang'an
to enjoy the late spring.

188
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,280
A tree draped in pear blossoms,
a stream beneath moonlight.

189
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,040
I wonder who

190
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,000
owns this sight tonight.

191
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,400
What a nice poem.

192
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,680
These

193
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,080
are all left by Yinlian.

194
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,320
Under my influence,

195
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,280
she also liked

196
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,040
poems and literature.

197
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,080
She occasionally wrote under my guidance.

198
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,520
Just a hobby.

199
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,280
Not good enough to be remembered.

200
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,360
Being close to orchids

201
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,840
will let one get a special fragrance.

202
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,800
If the poem is passed on to the world,

203
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,400
it's also a fine piece.

204
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,800
Seeing the things remind me of her.

205
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,120
It's hard to calm my heart.

206
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,840
Huaiying,

207
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,720
Let's talk somewhere else.

208
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,800
Magistrate.

209
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,440
This poem,

210
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,720
Yinlian asked me to revise it,

211
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,760
but I couldn't finish it.

212
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,640
Now,

213
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,200
I've finished it,

214
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,160
but it's too late

215
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,840
for her to see it.

216
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,760
Magistrate.

217
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,560
Have a seat.

218
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,120
Back in the court,

219
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I was the Secretary General
of the Right Guards.

220
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,480
This horsewhip

221
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,000
is what I used back then.

222
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,480
Ever since I left office,

223
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,400
I've kept it with me.

224
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,000
It commemorates

225
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,080
my years of military service.

226
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,720
Magistrate,

227
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,240
when are you going

228
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,440
to sentence me to death?

229
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,480
Mr. Teng,

230
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,520
have you ever heard of Li Han?

231
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,760
Li Han?

232
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,800
It's an unfamiliar name.

233
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,000
I've never heard of it.

234
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,320
Where did Mrs. Teng like to go

235
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,880
when she went out?

236
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,120
Usually,

237
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,240
I only write behind closed doors.

238
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,600
I don't know

239
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,800
where Yinlian went.

240
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,200
Before

241
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,640
Mrs. Teng married,

242
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,680
she was courted by Li Han.

243
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,960
Because he was a nuisance,

244
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,440
Mrs. Teng framed him

245
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,720
for robbery

246
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,760
and sent him to jail.

247
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,640
But a few days ago,

248
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,480
someone paid for Li Han's release.

249
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,000
Because Mrs. Teng framed him,

250
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,280
he suffered for nothing.

251
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,600
His hatred for her

252
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,840
is obvious.

253
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,400
On the day

254
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,760
Mrs. Teng was killed,

255
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,080
you

256
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,960
lost your mind in an attack

257
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,080
of madness.

258
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,880
In the study, someone

259
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,480
found

260
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,040
an evil spirit there.

261
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,400
Li Han

262
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,640
was just

263
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,320
in the residence.

264
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,400
The evil spirit rumored to have appeared

265
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,920
was probably him.

266
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,560
So

267
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,160
in this case,

268
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,320
he's the prime suspect.

269
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,400
If so,

270
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,280
this Li Han is the one who killed Yinlian.

271
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,200
The person who paid to release him

272
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,840
was equally guilty.

273
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,000
Who is that person?

274
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,160
If we find Li Han,

275
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,520
the truth will come out.

276
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,720
Thank you, Magistrate.

277
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:12,960
In fact,

278
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,760
here's the thing.

279
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,120
Whenever Master wrote a poem,

280
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,720
he stayed behind closed doors.

281
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,000
So

282
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,720
no one

283
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,760
dared to disturb him.

284
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,080
When Madam had nothing to do,

285
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,840
she'd return

286
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,640
to the Lai family

287
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,920
to visit her sister.

288
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,120
The two families...

289
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,680
I wonder

290
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,640
when was the last time

291
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,200
you met Mrs. Yinlian?

292
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,480
I don't like Yinlian,

293
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,960
so we had no contact.

294
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,880
Does ''her sister'' here refer
to Ms. Lai Er?

295
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,080
Yes.

296
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,960
She is an old girl

297
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,000
and has never married.

298
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,520
It's sad for her.

299
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,400
Had Mrs. Yinlian and Ms. Lai Er

300
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,440
always been seeing each other?

301
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,840
Not really.

302
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,720
I've heard they used to have a deep grudge

303
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,040
against each other.

304
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,640
It was only recently

305
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,960
they began to see each other again.

306
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,960
Ever since that day

307
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,040
when you were flirting

308
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,040
and behaved in a coquettish way,

309
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,600
I swore I'd never see you again.

310
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,560
After all, they're blood sisters.

311
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,920
How can there be any real grudges?

312
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,320
That's true.

313
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,400
[Teng's Residence]

314
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,800
Magistrate, mind your step.

315
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,920
Close the door.

316
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,320
Why are you here?

317
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,440
Bazong's dice

318
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
are very helpful, right?

319
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,040
Not bad.

320
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,600
Where are we going next?

321
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,520
Help me ask that friend of yours.

322
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,720
Where women in the city

323
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,880
usually go

324
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,280
to meet their lovers?

325
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,600
No need

326
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,400
to ask.

327
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,560
He already told me.

328
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,360
Why did he tell you that?

329
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,040
You don't have to care that.

330
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,280
Let's go, I'll take you there.

331
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,280
Welcome!

332
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,080
Waiter, two guests.

333
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,920
Come... Please come inside.

334
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,880
I don't want to drink or enjoy songs.

335
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,000
I want to ask you something.

336
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,480
This is a place

337
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,000
for drinking and enjoying songs.

338
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,240
For information,

339
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,880
you've come to the wrong place.

340
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,800
We're investigating a case.

341
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,400
I'm Di Renjie.

342
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,840
Magistrate Di.

343
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,040
I'm an ignorant woman.

344
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,600
I've heard

345
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,760
you have a room

346
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,360
exclusively for lovers to date.

347
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,560
Is that true?

348
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,360
This is a place for men to have fun.

349
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,600
We don't serve adulterers.

350
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,040
As long as you don't violate
the Tang Code,

351
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,000
I don't care

352
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,080
what you did.

353
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,480
Yes...

354
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,120
But

355
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,360
we really don't do this kind
of business here.

356
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,760
If you ask me again,

357
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,240
I can only answer truthfully.

358
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,480
To be frank...

359
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,640
I do

360
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,200
have a room....

361
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,480
Magistrate,

362
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,840
please also think for me.

363
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,800
Where is it?

364
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,600
It's been reserved by one for long.

365
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,720
By whom?

366
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,920
The person was veiled in black.

367
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,120
I don't know who it is.

368
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,000
Show me.

369
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,000
I don't think that's appropriate.

370
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,280
It seems

371
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,880
Bazong's dice don't work here.

372
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,840
Officer...

373
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,680
I didn't say
I wouldn't take you to see it.

374
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,560
It's upstairs.

375
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,760
Please come with me.

376
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,360
Come. Please.

377
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,960
It seems a county magistrate's power
is no more than the person in charge.

378
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,720
This is it.

379
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,040
Don't blame me, Magistrate.

380
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,600
We're doing business.

381
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,000
We have no choice.

382
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,760
You really don't know

383
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
who the person is?

384
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,400
I really don't know.

385
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,840
She never let me clean this room.

386
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,240
Since it was rented out,

387
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,720
even I haven't come in.

388
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,760
How about the one she met?

389
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,830
I don't even know.

390
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,590
You can go down first.

391
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:44,800
Magistrate.

392
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,040
Magistrate,

393
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:46,920
there's writing here.

394
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,240
[Mountains]

395
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,600
The old mountains stand,
yet my bonds no longer cling.

396
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,760
This is...

397
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,520
Mrs. Yinlian's handwriting.

398
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,400
Why is a flower here?

399
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,520
You went to all this trouble
just to tell me

400
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,160
that it's all about Kai.

401
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:33,800
Xu Kai.

402
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,200
Magistrate.

403
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,640
Magistrate.

404
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,040
That's called tampering with evidence.

405
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,840
They knew how to have fun.

406
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,360
It's all me.

407
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,840
In his whole life,

408
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,280
he's loved to draw me the most.

409
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,620
[Xu Kai]

410
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,480
There are four sisters in the painting.

411
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,800
Before Yinlian married,

412
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,880
she and her three sisters lived
in her family.

413
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,760
If this is not the story
of Yinlian and me,

414
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,320
what else could it be?

415
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,920
This is

416
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,880
our story.

417
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,560
Does this screen have a name?

418
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,280
The Four-panel Screen.

419
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,320
You are the one on it.

420
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,440
You and Xu Kai were having an affair

421
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,000
because you love each other.

422
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,480
I want to hear you

423
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,520
tell about Li Han.

424
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,840
I don't know him.

425
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,240
Back then,

426
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,040
it was here

427
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,280
that he was taken down by the servants.

428
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,320
You told me about it.

429
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,360
I forgot.

430
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,600
Can't I?

431
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,080
Well, look who's in this portrait.

432
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,400
Xu Kai.

433
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,840
It's Xu Kai.

434
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,360
He's dead?

435
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,720
How did he die?

436
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,160
Who killed him?

437
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,080
How do you know

438
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,280
he was killed?

439
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,160
Who killed him?

440
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,120
It's him.

441
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,680
It must be him.

442
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:48,960
Who?

443
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,960
It's me.

444
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,480
I got you into this.

445
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,160
It must be I who got you into this.

446
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,320
No.

447
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,960
It's Yinlian.

448
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,160
Shame on you.

449
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,480
You're so flirtatious.

450
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,640
You're already married.

451
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,920
Why do you still pester Mr. Xu?

452
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,440
That's between me and Mr. Xu.

453
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,120
I don't need you to judge us.

454
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,000
Besides,

455
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,040
Mr. Xu never liked you.

456
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,960
Nonsense!

457
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,320
Mr. Xu does like me.

458
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,400
He just doesn't want to say it.

459
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:23,760
He...

460
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,680
Sister,

461
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,240
how long will you lie to yourself?

462
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,280
What do you know?

463
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,000
No.

464
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,040
It's that bitch, Yinlian.

465
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,120
If it wasn't for her,

466
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,760
how could you have died?

467
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,520
What he likes is me.

468
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,160
It's me.

469
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,640
You knew

470
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,200
that Xu Kai was having an affair
with Yinlian.

471
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,120
No.

472
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,800
They were not.

473
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,720
Xu Kai was Yinlian's lover.

474
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,560
The one in the paintings is all Yinlian.

475
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,600
Why are you

476
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,920
deceiving yourself?

477
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,000
Get out.

478
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,360
Get out.

479
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,520
You all get out of here.

480
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,000
No.

481
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,040
No.

482
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,200
This is not Yinlian.

483
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,400
It's me.

484
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,480
It's me.

485
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,600
Xu Kai only draws me.

486
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,160
This is not Yinlian.

487
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,120
It's me.

488
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,320
It's me.

489
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,120
It's time to ask your friend

490
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,880
for a third favor.

491
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,960
Three dice, three favors,

492
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,400
all done?

493
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,440
The first one

494
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,800
was used in the quarry.

495
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,880
The second one

496
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,040
was at the entertainment house.

497
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,240
For the third one,

498
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I need you to spread some news for me.

499
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,680
Spread some news?

500
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,120
What news?

501
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,920
Yinlian isn't dead.

502
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,200
Do you guys know?

503
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:06,600
What?

504
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,960
Mrs. Teng was saved.

505
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,160
Mrs. Teng is not dead?

506
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:10,640
Yes.

507
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,520
She was so badly injured,
but she was saved.

508
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,040
Who's the doctor? So amazing.

509
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,400
Did you hear that?

510
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,600
Mrs. Teng didn't die.

511
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,040
Right.

512
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,520
Li,

513
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,400
did you hear that?

514
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,640
Mrs. Teng.

515
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,600
Mrs. Teng is still alive.

516
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,400
Great.

517
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,840
It's so lucky.

518
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,440
Mrs. Teng is still alive.

519
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,000
Mrs. Teng was stabbed so many times,

520
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,560
but she was still saved.

521
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,040
Oh, my goodness.

522
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,640
