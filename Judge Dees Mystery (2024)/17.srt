[Episode 17]

5
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,720
Mr. Di, the new magistrate of Lan Ward,

6
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,000
is now holding court for cases.

7
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,560
Anyone has anything to say

8
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,960
is welcome to step forward.

9
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,120
Wait a minute.

10
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,040
What do you do?

11
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,000
Sorry.

12
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,480
Magistrate,

13
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,520
how long do we have to wait?

14
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,200
We wait until the work time is over.

15
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,760
If no one comes to report,

16
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,000
we still keep waiting all the time?

17
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,680
Until the work time is over.

18
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,960
Miss Cao,

19
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,400
please take a rest.

20
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,600
There are so many case files.

21
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,240
You can't finish them

22
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,360
within one or two days.

23
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,760
Case files in the Zhenguan era

24
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,960
remain just two volumes.

25
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,680
In the files,

26
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,040
the recorded Shangshu Zuocheng

27
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,080
is Magistrate Di's father?

[File]

29
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,120
Master is

30
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,640
not a traitor.

31
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,080
The bandit leader of Heiyan

32
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,760
was Master's schoolmate.

33
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,120
He wanted to use Huaiying

34
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,920
to compel Master to cooperate with him

35
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,840
and send weapons to Chang'an

36
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,720
so as to stage an armed rebellion.

37
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,880
But Master wouldn't agree.

38
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
Master

39
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,440
feared that Huaiying would face danger,

40
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,240
so he committed suicide.

41
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,120
It was because of Minister Di

42
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,360
that the Court

43
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,800
found out what Heiyan aimed to do

44
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,280
and finally annihilated them.

45
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,840
Right.

46
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,120
But what was the good of that?

47
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,880
Though the previous emperor

48
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,480
rehabilitated the Master,

49
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,200
he had already died.

50
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,320
He could not be restored to life.

51
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,480
Huaiying now buries himself in cases.

52
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,160
He tries to popularize the Tang Code

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,760
and it has something to do

54
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,880
with the misfortunes happened that year.

55
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,640
Today, he

56
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,560
chose to hold court

57
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,600
on the rubbles.

58
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,400
I know

59
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,240
bad things would happen.

60
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,440
I want to report to Magistrate.

61
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,400
Come back.

62
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,080
This kid.

63
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,600
I want to report to Magistrate.

64
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,400
You little kid!

65
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,320
Go away!

66
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,040
Magistrate,

67
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,120
some one broke my father's leg.

68
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,880
Come back with me.

69
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,520
Come with me, now!

70
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,200
Wait.

71
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,720
Who broke your leg?

72
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,120
I fell down.

73
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,280
So my leg was broken.

74
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,200
It has nothing to do with others.

75
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,200
Let's move!

76
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,040
Did you

77
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,480
break your leg yourself,

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,720
or was it broken by someone else?

79
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,240
Magistrate.

80
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,080
If you don't tell Magistrate,

81
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,720
they won't stop.

82
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,640
Don't be afraid.

83
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,720
Speak up boldly.

84
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,160
The magistral office will capture them.

85
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,880
What can the magistral office do?

86
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,280
Even if the office was burnt down,

87
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,160
the code still exists.

88
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:23,960
Magistrate,

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,040
the magistral office wasn't burnt down
by someone.

90
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,400
The fire was caused by the lightning,

91
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,920
and it burnt for two days and nights.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,640
But no one came to put it off.

93
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,800
No one!

94
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,120
Because people didn't know

95
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,640
what the meaning was

96
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,760
to save the magistral office.

97
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,320
Go.

98
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,480
What is this about?

99
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:47,880
Father!

100
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,680
It is a fact.

101
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,800
Maybe you would feel better

102
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,920
when you think

103
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,680
it was caused by people.

104
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,840
Lan Ward

105
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,920
is divided into various parts,

106
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,070
and every part has a leader.

107
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,200
To announce sovereignty on the rubbles

108
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,400
seemed like an unimportant act,

109
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,280
but it was quite necessary for him

110
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,080
to popularize the Tang Code

111
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,760
that he believed in so much.

112
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,520
I think Magistrate Di

113
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,000
has preparations.

114
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,760
Miss Cao,

115
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,680
you are really Huaiying's confidante.

116
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,100
[Bupo Medicine Shop]

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,840
Fool!

118
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,320
He did it by himself.

119
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,880
He did it by himself.

120
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,000
This foot is large.

121
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It is really big.

122
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,720
Why is he measuring the feet?

123
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,840
Can he really perform autopsy?

124
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,080
Though Mr. Hu looks crazy,

125
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,520
in Lan Ward,

126
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,240
he might be the only physician

127
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,400
who has never made a mistake.

128
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,320
These could be a man's feet.

129
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,880
He is indeed a man.

130
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,440
You,

131
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,520
come here.

132
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,440
There is a red spot on the neck.

133
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,240
Did you see that?

134
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,080
Where is the red spot?

135
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,360
Was it caused by a poisonous needle?

136
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,040
No. He is...

137
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,560
He cut himself.

138
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,480

139
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,360

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:35,920
in this way,

142
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:36,960
this way,

143
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:37,840
and this way.

144
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,320
Does he show any symptoms of poisoning?

145
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,360
He must have bled a lot.

146
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,440
You see this cut.

147
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,320
You...

148
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,080
Does he show any symptoms of poisoning?

149
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,800
Why do you shout at me?

150
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,080

151
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,680
- Wait.
- I perform the autopsy or you do it?

- You stand aside.
- Mr. Hu.

153

Mr. Hu,

154
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,400
please don't say that.

155
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,840
Didn't I introduce him to you?

156
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,040
He is Magistrate Di,
the new officer of Lan Ward.

158
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,960

00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,880
Open the door. What are you doing inside?

Open the door.

173
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,320
Wait...

174
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:28,840
Open the door.

Coming.

176
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,360
You are slow.

177
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,960
We called you so many times.
What were you doing?

178
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,240
Where is the medicine?

179
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,360
Don't speak to Mr. Hu like this.

180
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,280
Sorry.

181
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,840
This man is insensible.

182
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,440
Mr. Hu.

183
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,600
You are sensible.

184
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,560
What are you looking at?

185
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,640
What are you looking at?

186
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,200
Go!

187
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,080
You brat.

188
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,200
Since the 20th year of the Zhenguan era,

189
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,320
there were records one after another

190
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,040
depicting the stories of Heiyan

191
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,320
in the local documents

192
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,880
of Lan Ward.

193
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,120
But this group of Heiyan bandits

194
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,320
was totally different from the one

195
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,000
the Imperial Court had annihilated.

196
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,240
They didn't do anything

197
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,000
against the court,

198
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,080
but they controlled all businesses.

199
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,680
Gambling places,

200
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,920
pubs,

201
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,640
and entertainment houses.

202
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,320
Sometimes, they also committed murders.

203
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,400
Although their businesses

204
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,080
covered all the Lan Ward,

205
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,080
they were restricted

206
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,880
within this place.

207
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,920
They were just some survivors of Heiyan.

208
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,120
They weren't reconciled to failure
and gathered together

209
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,800
to do some disgraceful business.

210
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,320
Mr. Hong,

211
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,720
please look at this.

212
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,000
The last time Heiyan showed up in Lan Ward

213
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,720
was at the beginning of the fifth year
of the Gengshen cycle.

214
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,240
[*Gengshen means a specific year]
The fifth year of the Gengshen cycle

215
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,120
[within a 60-year cycle.]
is the year when the Penglai war occurred.

216
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,120
All of them went to Penglai

217
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,160
to loot gold and weapons.

218
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,240
That war

219
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,120
was lethal to Heiyan.

220
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,160
They took risks,

221
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,200
but their leaders were killed.

222
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,960
Heiyan thus suffered a great loss.

223
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,600
Heiyan has disappeared.

224
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,560
God helps Huaiying.

225
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,240
I am really afraid that he would tumble

226
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,160
over the same thing as his father did.

227
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,040
Huaiying

228
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,960
should be the literary name

229
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,800
of Magistrate Di after his enlightenment.

230
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,080
Why is it carved on the toy
of his childhood?

231
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,680
It was a long time ago.

232
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,240
I have already forgot

233
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,280
these old things.

234
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,480
I should put it aside.

235
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,340
[Ying]

236
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,840
By order of Magistrate Di,

237
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,480
we will count the heads in Red Pavilion.

238
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,160
Madam, I haven't slept all night.

239
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,280
Are you new here?

240
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,000
Fine.

241
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:05,960
Qiu Yue,

242
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:07,720
that night,

243
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,400
in this room,

244
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,720
what did you actually do?

245
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,280
I did nothing.

246
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,760
That night, I...

247
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,760
Do you know?

248
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,920
The blood on his wrist

249
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,600
was almost dry.

250
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,560
But the ink on the table

251
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,600
was still wet.

252
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,600
You said that when you came in,

253
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,880
he was already dead.

254
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,120
Then, you called for help.

255
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,560
Yes.

256
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,880
You are lying.

257
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,560
I'm not.

258
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,680
You tampered with the crime scene.

259
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,680
What were you looking for?

260
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,040
Did you

261
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,000
imitate Biyu

262
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,640
and kill Li Tao?

263
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,480
Speak!

264
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,040
Magistrate Di,

265
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,600
let me tell you a story.

266
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,440
As a kid, I traveled with my father
on business trips.

267
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,080
But one time,

268
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,240
we encountered a sandstorm.

269
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,200
Run!

270
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,840
Hurry up...

271
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,840
Sandstorm!

272
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,920
Run!

273
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,040
I thought

274
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,440
it was a normal sandstorm.

275
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,640
But unexpectedly,

276
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,640
the violence of the sandstorm

277
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,520
was far beyond everyone's imagination.

278
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,040
Father,

279
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,400
where are you?

280
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,680
Among the whole trade caravan,

281
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,240
only I survived.

282
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,440
Help.

283
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,640
That day,

284
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,640
five trade caravans passed by,

285
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,600
but no one intended to save me.

286
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,480
Wait.

287
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,200
She is dying.

288
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,800
If you give her water,

289
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,400
all of us could die.

290
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:41,920
Let's go.

291
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,560
Actually,

292
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,480
no one would really care

293
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,800
about a dying girl.

294
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,040
But then,

295
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,240
I met Biyu, who was passing by.

296
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,880
She saved my life.

297
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,760
After that, I came with her

298
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,120
to the Red Pavilion.

299
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,760
Miss Qiu Yue...

300
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,880
Magistrate Di,

301
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,520
I haven't finished yet.

302
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,440
You don't have to pity me.

303
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,480
I told you these

304
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,040
not for your sympathy.

305
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,480
This is Lan Ward.

306
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,000
This is the desert.

307
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,800
Maybe,

308
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,160
this is my fate.

309
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,800
Lan Ward

310
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,600
is a place for insincere,

311
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,840
predatory,

312
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,800
and adaptable people.

313
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,480
Green Dragon Gang and Black Tiger Gang

314
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,360
are just like this.

315
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,000
So,

316
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,000
I came with Biyu

317
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,440
to the Red Pavilion

318
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,240
just to...

319
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,120
To live.

320
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,800
That's not shameful.

321
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,840
Until one day,

322
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,640
I met Mr. Li.

323
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,040
He was nice,

324
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,640
gentle,

325
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,440
and kind.

326
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,760
He was so elegant

327
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,160
and was like a lotus under the sunshine.

328
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,560
He was gentle to everyone.

329
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,560
He would give beggars money.

330
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,240
He would dissuade bullies when he saw

331
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,720
them picking on the weak.

332
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,040
He would go to the well

333
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,000
and stop the fights every day.

334
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,240
He was so elegant

335
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,200
that he was not like an earthly man.

336
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,640
So,

337
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,800
you fell in love with him.

338
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,040
No.

339
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,640
He loved me.

340
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,440
He once proposed to you,

341
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,350
but you refused him.

342
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,200
Why would you do that?

343
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,110
Didn't you want to leave

344
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,960
the Red Pavilion?

345
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,590
I'm living a good life here.

346
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,040
I don't want to marry a rich man

347
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,360
and be his concubine.

348
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,880
You doubted that

349
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,400
Mr. Li had true feelings

350
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,920
for you.

351
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,800
No need for that.

352
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,120
After I objected to his proposal,

353
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,960
he took a different attitude

354
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,760
toward me.

355
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,040
Mister.

356
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,520
Get out!

357
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,120
Mister!

358
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,560
You get out!

359
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,400
Without my permission, you can't come in.

360
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,400
What's the matter?

361
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,520
Mister!

362
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,840
Although he became indifferent to me

363
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,600
and estranged me,

364
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,560
I always remember

365
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,640
the first time we met.

366
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,960
You are like a lady from a painting.

367
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,360
As Li Tao

368
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,520
took a different attitude toward you,

369
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,720
you became unhappy

370
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,880
and gave up your feelings for him.

371
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,480
Until...

372
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,600
I know what you are thinking about.

373
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,800
Mr. Li

374
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,760
died.

375
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,200
I am a prostitute

376
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,160
and want to take advantage of this

377
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,120
to live a better life.

378
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,760
Is that wrong?

379
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,160
I must admit

380
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,200
that up to now,

381
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,800
what you said

382
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,840
is true.

383
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,680
However...

384
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,400
You want to say

385
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,600
that I lied that night.

386
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,760
Yeah.

387
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,560
I lied.

388
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,400
What is it?

389
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,240
You killed Li Tao

390
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,520
and you searched for something

391
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,880
in the room.

392
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:55,880
Right?

393
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,200
When I entered Mr. Li's room that night,

394
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,640
he was indeed dead.

395
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,240
I have told you

396
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,040
that Mr. Li said

397
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,480
he was writing a will.

398
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,080
If I have this will,

399
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,200
I can prove that I am innocent.

400
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,120
Then, where is the will?

401
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,280
I haven't found it.

402
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,560
Perhaps,

403
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,080
there is no will at all.

404
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,080
I know

405
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,280
you suspect that I killed him.

406
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,280
I know all of you suspect me.

407
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,440
You believe

408
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,080
that I wanted to imitate
Biyu's legendary story.

409
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,000
But the only good man in Lan Ward died.

410
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,800
If you think I am the murderer,

411
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,640
you can arrest me.

412
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,280
I am a humble girl anyway.

413
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,760
It doesn't matter.

414
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,240
Remember.

415
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,800
What I said just now

416
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,480
was all truth.

417
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,000
You...

418
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,640
Believe it or not.

419
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,360
Magistrate.

420
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,840
A guard is missing.

421
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,760
Just missing

422
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,600
a dishonest and untrustworthy guard.

423
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,960
It's quite normal.

424
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,840
Nobody would notice.

425
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,440
When did he disappear?

426
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,520
It seems like

427
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,040
two days ago.

428
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,040
That day, Mr. Qiao

429
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,200
wanted to eat fruits from Yonglin Shop.

430
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,680
So I asked him to buy some.

431
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,680
He never returned

432
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,080
after leaving.

433
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,120
You can say that Mr. Qiao wants it.

434
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,480
Business as usual.

435
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,000
Magistrate,

436
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,160
I've seen him.

437
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,680
It was not the first time

438
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,920
Wei Cheng ran away after losing money.

439
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,240
Before that,

440
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,080
he would leave for some days.

441
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,920
When he got enough money,

442
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,920
he would come back again.

443
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,360
He is good at fighting.

444
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,720
I'm willing to hire him.

445
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,200
As far as I know,

446
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,520
he won't kill a man in the Red Pavilion

447
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,320
and burn his own bridge.

448
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,880
Magistrate,

449
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,000
Wei Cheng is a gambler.

450
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,160
I know that.

451
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,360
So do I.

452
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,120
What Mr. Po said is true.

453
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,040
I have also heard

454
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,760
of this person.

455
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,880
If he really killed Li for money,

456
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,480
he wouldn't come back

457
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,520
this time.

458
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,200
Find him.

459
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,320
Yes.

460
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,480
Magistrate,

461
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:39,880
you've finally come.

462
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,680
Magistrate,

463
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,440
this is Wei Cheng's house.

464
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,760
It seems that

465
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,240
it hasn't been inhabited for a long time.

466
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,040
He must have come back.

467
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,480
Where can he be?

468
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,160
Come out.

469
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,440
Cross cut.

470
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,600
Qian Hao.

471
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,840
Why did Qian Hao want to kill you?

472
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,800
Like...

473
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,760
Like you.

474
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,520
But I'm not the murderer.

475
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,720
Do you know Li Tao?

476
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,680
Mr. Li?

477
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,160
I do.

478
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,800
He is dead.

479
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,840
You killed him?

480
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,000
No.

481
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,520
I didn't.

482
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,200
Mr. Li was my benefactor.

483
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,360
I once stole his property

484
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,000
but got caught on the spot.

485
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,880
Mr. Li didn't accuse me.

486
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,560
Instead, he lent me money

487
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,960
to pay off debts
at a northern gambling den.

488
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,680
You were afraid

489
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,440
that you couldn't pay back his money,

490
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,960
so you harbored a murderous intent.

491
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,040
Where did you get

492
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,960
those drugs that numb people?

493
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,040
How did you kill him

494
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,880
and stage it to look like a suicide?

495
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,000
I didn't kill him.

496
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,440
You didn't?

497
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,360
Though I am addicted to gambling,

498
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,200
I am not a bad guy.

499
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,200
I would rather be killed by people
from the gambling den

500
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,920
than harm Mr. Li.

501
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,040
I am a scoundrel.

502
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,680
My death is not to be regretted.

503
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,480
Wei Cheng!

504
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,440
Wei Cheng!

505
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,400
What did he mean by saying that?

506
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,280
What is "like us"?

507
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,200
Qian Hao

508
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,760
is also looking for the murderer.

509
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,680
Why?

510
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,080
[*Anhua: A undisclosed and illegal reward]
Someone offered Anhua.

511
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,840
Hire someone to commit murder

512
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,560
and to seek revenge for Mr. Li.

513
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,880
Your son Li Tao...

514
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,560
I am...

515
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,320
Governor Li…

516
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,920
When the tulip withers,

517
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,720
the spring

518
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,480
is about to end.

519
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,480
He is my only son.

520
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,440
Let's go.

521
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,120
Magistrate, where are we going?

522
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,320
To see Governor Li's father.

523
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,360
Magistrate,

524
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,520
all gangs in the city

525
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,320
are looking for the murderer

526
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,800
and they killed many innocent people.

527
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,680
The one who faces the greatest danger

528
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,680
is Qiu Yue.

529
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,480
How much is the Anhua?

530
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,840
It even makes Qian Hao tempted.

531
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,040
Then we should ask

532
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,360
the person who offered the Anhua.

533
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,220
[Li Mansion]

534
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,240
You can't get in.

535
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,760
You can't get in.

536
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,080
Get out of the way!

537
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,480
Magistrate.

538
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,160
Governor Li!

539
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,080
The master suffers the loss of a son.

540
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,720
Di Renjie

541
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,360
is here to offer condolences.

542
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,400
Take it easy.
The magistrate is investigating a case.

543
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,600
- The magistrate is investigating a case.
- Magistrate, you can't do this.

544
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,480
Please make no fuss.

545
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,040
Magistrate, you can't get inside.

546
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,560
Please make no fuss.

547
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,440
You can't get in there.

548
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,000
Governor Li!

549
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,560
The pain of losing a son

550
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,640
is very profound.

551
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,120
I have also suffered the loss
of loved ones.

552
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,200
I can relate to you.

553
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,080
But you were an official for many years.

554
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,320
How can you know the law and yet break it,

555
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,760
and hire someone to commit murder?

556
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,160
Get out.

557
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,480
Governor Li,

558
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,440
you were an official.

559
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,040
You brought welfare to the local people.

560
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,320
The populace there loved you.

561
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,080
Your son Li Tao

562
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,080
treated people kindly

563
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,640
in Lan Ward.

564
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,120
He lost his life,

565
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
and all the people in the city

566
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,920
are mourning for him spontaneously.

567
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,760
But what about you?

568
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,760
What you did

569
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,640
is an insult to all of this.

570
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,760
Someone killed my son

571
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,200
and staged it like a suicide.

572
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,920
I want the murderer

573
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,480
to pay with his own life.

574
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,120
Governor Li,

575
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,240
we cannot confirm

576
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,200
if Qiu Yue is the real culprit.

577
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,760
Please trust me.

578
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,680
I will definitely bring the murderer

579
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,520
to justice.

580
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,840
Di Renjie,

581
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,840
I have contracted tuberculosis.

582
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,120
I don't have time

583
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,480
to wait for your justice.

584
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,040
So,

585
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,760
you offered Anhua

586
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,240
and let Qian Hao kill

587
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,720
the murderer for you.

588
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,520
Not just Qian Hao.

589
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,960
Whoever

590
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,280
kills the murderer doesn't matter

591
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,360
as long as my son

592
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,280
is avenged.

593
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,280
This is my only way.

594
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,960
Governor Li,

595
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,160
innocent people

596
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,800
should not have been killed for no reason.

597
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,960
I will definitely

598
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,040
seek for justice

599
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,200
for your son.

600
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:58,140
[Li Mansion]

601
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,640
It's on fire!

602
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,840
There is fire!

603
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,400
There is fire!

604
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,440
There is fire!

605
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,560
Someone come and put out the fire!

606
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,160
The house is on fire.

607
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,560
Come and put out the fire!

608
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,560
Someone come here!

609
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,960
Mr. Hu.

610
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,440
There is fire.

611
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,320
He is still alive.

612
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,040
Corpse.

613
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,800
Li Tao's corpse.

614
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,640
Water...

615
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,840
Magistrate, the fire inside
is pretty much out.

616
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,080
Mind your steps.

617
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,040
[Promissory note]

618
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,040
They are all promissory notes.

619
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,080
Mr. Hu's promissory notes

620
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,280
for borrowing money from others.

621
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,440
Black Tiger Gang.

622
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,880
Black Tiger Gang.

623
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,720
Magistrate.

624
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:37,960
Magistrate.

625
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,760
Mr. Li and the others have come.

626
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,000
Magistrate.

627
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,280
Let me see.

628
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,040
Qian Hao.

629
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,240
It must be Qian Hao who set the fire.

630
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,880
Qian Hao?

631
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,360
Why did he intend to kill Mr. Hu?

632
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,800
Let me tell you, Miss Ma.

633
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,680
Since Governor Li offered his Anhua,

634
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,320
all the gangs in the city

635
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,680
want to claim the Anhua.

636
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,640
Black Tiger Gang

637
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,240
is the largest gang in the city.

638
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,040
So, they won't tolerate others

639
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,280
finding the murderer before them.

640
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,440
I was asking

641
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,680
why Qian Hao intended to kill Mr. Hu.

642
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,480
Is Mr. Hu the murderer?

643
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,520
Mr. Hu must have discovered some clues

644
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,720
and he refused to give them to Qian Hao.

645
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,360
So...

646
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,120
Mr. Hu discovered some clues?

647
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,560
Even I, as the magistrate, was unaware,

648
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,520
but Qian Hao knew this before me?

649
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,520
What's the matter?

650
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,670
There's a traitor among us.

651
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,080
That explains why.

652
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:01,880
Magistrate,

653
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,480
in this place,

654
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,560
almost everyone is involved
with those gangs.

655
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,800
What should we do?

656
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,440
Qiao Tai!

657
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,320
Come down here if you are available.

658
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,710
Okay!

659
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:31,400
Magistrate.

660
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,710
Arrange some men

661
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,880
to clean up the backyard.

662
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,920
The magistral office was destroyed.

663
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,600
If Mr. Hu is not seriously injured,

664
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,520
let him rest in the backyard.

665
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,720
Understood.

666
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:44,960
You guys come with me!

667
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:45,920
Coming.

668
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,200
Come over and give a hand.

669
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,440
Okay.

670
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,080
You come, too.

671
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:50,640
Yes.

672
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,800
Magistrate,

673
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,640
did Qian Hao really do this?

674
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,120
Not sure yet.

675
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:57,960
Magistrate.

676
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,040
How is Mr. Hu?

677
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,640
I think

678
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,600
he is fine.

679
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,400
He was probably just overcome by smoke.

680
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,360
Go to the backyard.

681
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,480
Understood.

682
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,480
Let's go.

683
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,240
Okay.

684
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,760
This place has so many gangs.

685
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,360
Mr. Li,

686
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,720
why are you sure

687
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,880
this

688
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,040
was done by Qian Hao?

689
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,000
I think

690
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,040
the Black Tiger Gang
is the leading one in the Lan Ward.

691
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,240
So the speculation arose from my mind.

692
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,400
But I think

693
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,240
Qian Hao would not be so reckless.

694
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,240
Why?

695
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,120
These gangs

696
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,240
always fight each other.

697
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,600
They often get sick or injured.

698
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,080
As is known,

699
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,640
Mr. Hu is not only a coroner

700
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,040
but also one of best physicians
in Lan Ward.

701
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,240
Harming him

702
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,120
could provoke anger of the populace.

703
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,720
Magistrate,

704
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,320
could it be that

705
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,080
Mr. Hu actually has found out some clues?

706
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,800
Magistrate,

707
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,840
Mr. Hu woke up.

708
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,600
He woke up?

709
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,160
He woke up.

710
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,200
Everyone,

711
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,960
please wait here for a minute.

712
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,080
Okay.

713
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:25,880
Alright then.

714
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:37,560
Rong!

715
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,360
Something has gone wrong.

716
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,160
Things are about to get serious.

717
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,040
Magistrate,

718
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,320
is Mr. Hu awake?

719
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,800
He woke up for seconds

720
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,040
but fainted again.

721
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,000
Did he say anything?

722
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,040
He told me

723
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,120
some very important clues.

724
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,520
Mr. Li,

725
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,680
please take care of things here.

726
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,080
Arrange more men

727
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,240
to protect Mr. Hu.

728
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,440
When he wakes up,

729
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,600
you should record his words carefully.

730
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,000
I have a more important thing to do now.

731
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,120
I'll leave

732
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,360
this place to you.

733
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:09,840
Okay.

734
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,760
Mr. Li,

735
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,000
my mother is at home alone, I should go.

736
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:19,960
Please take care of this place.

737
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:21,960
Goodbye.

738
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,640
Bye!

739
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:27,880
Mr. Li,

740
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,080
I should go, too.

741
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,400
Thanks for your efforts.

742
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:33,720
Goodbye.

743
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,920
How are those two persons?

744
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,640
Mr. Li has been staying

745
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,520
in Mr. Hu's pharmacy.

746
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,440
Secretary Bai didn't come out
after he got home.

747
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,880
Then it's him.

748
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,280
He has been here for a long time.

749
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,600
He must be waiting for someone.

750
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,120
Someone is coming.

751
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,760
Only you come here?

752
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,520
Only me.

753
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,080
I'm here to tell you...

754
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:42,880
Qian Hao?

755
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,440
Okay. I know.

756
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:52,840
He left.

757
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,480
You ungrateful traitor!

758
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,160
Please allow me to explain.

759
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,680
Shut up.

760
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,640
With people like you,

761
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,760
the Lan Ward is corrupted to the core.

762
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,680
Magistrate, I...

763
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:18,400
I...

764
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,720
You take him back first.

765
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,280
Yes.

766
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,480
Where are you going?

767
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,200
Qian Hao!

768
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,840
You can't take

769
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,080
Governor Li's Anhua.

770
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,880
Why would I listen to you?

771
