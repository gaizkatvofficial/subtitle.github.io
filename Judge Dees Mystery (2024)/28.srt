00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,740
[Judge Dee's Mystery]

2
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,980
[Based on the novel of the same name
by the Dutch author Robert van Gulik]

3
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:46,980
[Episode 28]

4
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,980
[This is a work of fiction.
Any resemblance is purely coincidental.]

5
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,360
He left the dagger

6
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,030
as a warning.

7
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,000
But why did he take away
the little wooden sword?

8
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,200
Look at this.

9
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,870
Hong,

10
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,310
tell me,

11
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,400
what else do you know?

12
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,270
I think you must have guessed it.

13
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,840
I want you to tell me yourself.

14
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,430
Heiyan

15
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,840
is

16
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,720
your brother.

17
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:40,950
Just leave.

18
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,110
I'll be back.

19
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,310
I'll be back.

20
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,480
I thought

21
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,510
the character Ying carved
on the little wooden sword

22
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,800
[Ying]
was my courtesy name.

23
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,440
Now it seems

24
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,800
the little wooden sword

25
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,830
was my brother's toy.

26
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,590
The character Ying

27
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,630
is my brother's given name.

28
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,800
That's right.

29
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,270
Heiyan is Di Ying.

30
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,160
Di Ying.

31
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,120
When did you know

32
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,190
he's in Lanfang County?

33
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,590
I saw the drawing on the pottery shard.

34
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,360
He hasn't changed.

35
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,720
You two run slowly. Don't fall.

36
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,910
Ying, slow down.

37
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,080
Wait for me.

38
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,830
Come. Hurry up.

39
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,800
You knew he is Heiyan.

40
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,880
Why didn't you tell me?

41
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,720
How could I possibly bring this up to you?

42
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,080
Back then, His Lordship

43
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,000
personally drove him away.

44
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,960
It was my father?

45
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,750
If Chu Lei is really your brother,

46
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,110
will you commit fratricide?

47
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,160
Ying, I also want a sword.

48
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,440
No way. You are still young.

49
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,000
You need to study hard.

50
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,160
You're no longer

51
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,190
a member of our family.

52
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,550
Just leave.

53
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:30,910
Tai,

54
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,320
the five-day deadline isn't up yet.

55
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,550
Chu Lei went back on his words.

56
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,470
They were cut by several different knives.

57
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,190
There should be more than one assailant.

58
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,550
Chu Lei might not be the murderer.

59
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,110
If it wasn't Chu Lei,

60
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,600
who else could it be?

61
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,910
The murderers may be among them.

62
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:00,960
Magistrate,

63
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,670
these four people have confessed.

64
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,200
The victims were killed by them.

65
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,830
Tell me your names

66
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,600
and occupations.

67
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,160
Chen Tai.

68
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,830
I'm Wang Liu.

69
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,000
Meng Qi.

70
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,320
Han Fang.

71
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,070
I run a teahouse in the east of the city.

72
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,390
Meng Qi

73
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,200
is a scholar preparing for the exams.

74
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,110
Wang Liu is a blacksmith.

75
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,390
Chen Tai

76
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,390
works in a pharmacy.

77
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,160
Do you plead guilty?

78
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,040
We killed them.

79
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,000
Why?

80
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,640
Not for money,

81
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,230
not for revenge.

82
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,600
No grudge among us.

83
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,320
Just to survive.

84
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,790
How did the two

85
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,720
who were killed

86
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,670
threaten your lives?

87
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,800
It is written clearly on Heiyan's notice.

88
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,990
Within five days,

89
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,240
if one man leaves Lanfang County
without permission,

90
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,990
one man chosen at random will be killed.

91
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,520
If two people leave the county
without permission,

92
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,430
two people chosen at random
will be killed.

93
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,200
On that day, the two of them

94
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,430
tried to leave the county
without permission,

95
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,310
and we discovered it.

96
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,960
Have you made up your mind?

97
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,480
When shall we leave?

98
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,200
Today at the Zi hour.

99
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,640
What do you want to do?

100
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,800
Murder!

101
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,550
You are running away

102
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,990
without considering the lives
of the people in the county.

103
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,760
They wanted to run away
without the need to worry about anything.

104
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,360
But our whole families

105
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,200
are still here.

106
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,920
Where can we go?

107
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,230
Besides,

108
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:51,440
after they left,

109
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,950
some people in the county would be killed.

110
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,230
There was nothing wrong

111
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,510
with us doing that.

112
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,660
- Right.
- Right.

113
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,670
Right. We are not guilty.

114
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,880
We also want to survive.

115
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,000
Sheer nonsense.

116
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,510
You really can't tell

117
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,350
right from wrong.

118
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,510
Meng Qi,

119
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,000
you are a scholar.

120
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,350
Because of a notice

121
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,350
and

122
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,200
a false rumor,

123
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,510
Tongkang Village

124
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,790
was wiped out.

125
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,600
Now,

126
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,160
there is another notice.

127
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,790
Are you trying to make Lanfang County
suffer the same fate as well?

128
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,320
I'm asking you,

129
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,320
Meng Qi,

130
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,040
if the notice says

131
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,160
as long

132
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,640
as everyone

133
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,070
in your family,

134
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,320
old and young,

135
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,510
dies,

136
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,830
the people in Lanfang County

137
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,320
can be safe.

138
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,230
Will everyone in your family
commit suicide?

139
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,790
Answer me!

140
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,110
If you can

141
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,110
punish the culprit

142
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,390
and bring Heiyan to justice

143
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,440
as you said,

144
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,000
the people in the county

145
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,110
don't have to worry anymore.

146
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,390
Right.

147
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,160
We don't want to be like this, either.

148
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,350
We just want to live.

149
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:32,880
Take them away.

150
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:33,600
Yes.

151
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,790
We did this for the people of the county.

152
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,200
Hurry up.

153
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,720
We didn't do anything wrong.

154
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,350
We didn't do anything wrong.

155
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,510
We didn't do anything wrong.

156
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,230
Magistrate.

157
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,270
Magistrate.

158
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,230
Get them all on duty.

159
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,600
Take turns to patrol the streets.

160
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,390
Don't let anything like this happen again.

161
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:58,950
Leave the court.

162
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,070
It's unfair.

163
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,510
Nobody cares about the lives
of the people.

164
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,140
[Starting from today, Heiyan will recruit
new members in five days.]

165
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,740
[Five days later, those who are not
members of Heiyan will be killed.]

166
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,200
Huaiying.

167
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,960
From today on,

168
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,280
stay in the Magistrate's Office.

169
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,790
Things have gone this far.

170
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,640
You don't have to put yourself
in harm's way.

171
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,640
Magistrate,

172
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,230
you have thought of a solution?

173
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:40,790
No.

174
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,230
Magistrate,

175
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,710
a man like him isn't worth it.

176
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,470
You have your limits.

177
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,470
But it might harm the people around you.

178
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,360
Go have a rest.

179
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,240
Thank you.

180
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,150
Huaiying,

181
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,390
what's your plan

182
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,320
for the next step?

183
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,440
If Chu Lei

184
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,360
really is Di Ying,

185
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,190
he will come to me.

186
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,360
Even if he will come,

187
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,240
it will be after the five-day deadline.

188
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,880
When the five-day deadline is up,

189
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,150
he will do what he said.

190
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,120
What do you think

191
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,750
I can do?

192
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,360
I think

193
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,510
you should report an emergency
to the governor

194
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,440
and ask him to send troops

195
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,480
to Lanfang County

196
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,750
to capture those with Heiyan tattoos.

197
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,240
At least, it will stabilize
the current chaos.

198
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,070
If we capture all the people
with Heiyan tattoos,

199
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,750
the number of people is too many

200
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,880
for the prison of the Magistrate's Office.

201
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,510
But when the five-day deadline is up,

202
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,440
people with Heiyan tattoos will
be everywhere in Lanfang County.

203
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,000
Did you forget the chaos
when we just came to Lanfang County?

204
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,750
Those with Heiyan tattoos

205
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,040
are just ordinary people.

206
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,480
They didn't break any law.

207
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,270
They

208
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,630
just want to survive.

209
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,950
Heiyan, please don't kill me.

210
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,710
It is hung there.

211
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,320
I also have this. Yeah.

212
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,680
Come back.

213
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,880
Come back.

214
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,630
Don't run.

215
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,510
- It's for your own good.
- I don't want it.

216
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:54,920
You...

217
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:55,900
Come back with me.

218
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,860
What are you doing?

219
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:57,950
Magistrate,

220
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,070
I have no Heiyan tattoo.

221
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,560
I'm not afraid of dying.

222
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,000
Don't kill me.

223
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,830
Let my child survive, Magistrate.

224
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,040
Thank you, Magistrate.

225
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,360
No!

226
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,150
Go.

227
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,710
- No!
- Go!

228
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,440
Hurry up and go.

229
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,560
No.

230
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,390
Hong,

231
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,440
do you still think

232
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,320
I should report to the governor

233
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,000
and ask him to send troops
to capture these people?

234
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,120
Don't kill me.

235
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,710
Let's go back.

236
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,950
Heiyan, please, don't kill me.

237
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,240
They are really running wild.

238
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,320
Such a scene on the street.

239
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,800
Do we still have to patrol the streets?

240
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,980
[Lanfang County Magistrate's Office]

241
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,630
Huaiying,

242
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,830
what are you doing?

243
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,680
I'm still thinking about Chunyu's case.

244
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:31,950
Now,

245
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,440
the murder case of Mr. Chen (the Sixth)
and his wife,

246
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,510
the case of the death of Loong,

247
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,800
and

248
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,710
the tragic case of Tongkang Village

249
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,070
have all been solved.

250
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,750
But I still can't figure out

251
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,630
one thing in Chunyu's case.

252
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,510
Chu Lei

253
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,830
has already

254
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,800
punished Lin Fan.

255
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,240
If Chunyu

256
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,120
was really killed by Chu Lei,

257
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,950
here is the problem.

258
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,240
Why did he take revenge

259
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,560
after ten years?

260
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,710
Chunyu's case

261
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,590
was the beginning of the series of things.

262
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,190
The murder case of Mr. Chen (the Sixth)
and his wife,

263
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,800
Loong's case,

264
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,630
and the tragic case of Tongkang Village

265
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,040
correspond respectively

266
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:19,920
to love,

267
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:20,920
hatred,

268
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:21,800
desire,

269
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:22,830
and ignorance.

270
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,120
Also,

271
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,070
the five-day deadline in Lanfang County

272
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,120
corresponds

273
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,560
to greed.

274
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:31,630
How will Chu Lei

275
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,750
concretize anger

276
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,480
and dislike?

277
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,590
We are just reacting blindly.

278
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,360
This way, we only end up
at a disadvantage in every situation.

279
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,800
If I can't solve Chunyu's case,

280
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,830
I won't be able to do anything.

281
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,440
Are you enjoying

282
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,480
your stay here?

283
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,240
I'm just waiting for death.

284
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,440
Anywhere is the same.

285
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,190
I want you ask you

286
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,880
about one thing.

287
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,560
Please tell me the truth.

288
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,150
Please go ahead.

289
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,630
I won't lie to you.

290
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,240
After Chunyu married
into your Lang family,

291
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,270
how did she

292
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,750
get along with your son?

293
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,360
They didn't get along well.

294
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,750
At the beginning,

295
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,800
I really liked Chunyu.

296
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
She was beautiful,

297
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,070
skilled,

298
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,880
and kind.

299
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:32,680
But after she married
into our family,

300
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,710
she never smiled.

301
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:41,120
It wasn't until she was abducted

302
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,510
that I knew she had never

303
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,880
slept with my son.

304
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,560
Such being the case,

305
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,270
why didn't you

306
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,830
break off their engagement?

307
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,120
Our Lang family

308
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,710
was a big family which was respected

309
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,270
in Tongkang Village.

310
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,070
Why should we
break off their engagement?

311
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,120
Was my son supposed

312
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,680
to sacrifice his own feelings

313
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,680
for Chunyu and her poor sweetheart?

314
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,800
Sweetheart?

315
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,880
Yes.

316
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,150
She

317
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,040
and her sweetheart secretly pledged
to marry long ago.

318
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,510
It was just that her father,

319
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,240
the shopkeeper of Xiao's Dyeing House,

320
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,040
got in the way.

321
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,880
That was why they couldn't get married.

322
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,110
Let go of my daughter!

323
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,320
Get lost!

324
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,560
I tell you,

325
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,990
if you don't have any accomplishments,

326
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,870
you'll never see my daughter again.

327
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,600
Get lost!

328
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,510
- Chunyu.
- Father, let go of me!

329
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,440
Wait for me.

330
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:04,960
Go.

331
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,680
Chu Lei,

332
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,200
don't go.

333
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,600
Go.

334
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,630
Chu Lei.

335
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,440
Chu Lei.

336
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,390
- Don't go.
- Go with me.

337
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,270
Chu Lei.

338
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,560
But when I asked you,

339
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,560
didn't you say

340
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,680
you had never heard of Chu Lei?

341
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,750
I really don't know this man.

342
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,110
Nor have I ever met him.

343
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,960
I don't want to know who he is.

344
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,080
Well?

345
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:40,110
I asked my son to divorce Chunyu.

346
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,600
Do you think it's improper?

347
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,320
I was thinking

348
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,630
if you

349
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,110
had fulfilled them

350
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,750
and had broken off the engagement

351
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,870
that led to the marriage in name only,

352
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,350
Tongkang Village

353
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,870
would not have been wiped out.

354
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,440
Perhaps

355
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,870
your son

356
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,200
could have survived.

357
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,270
This was the truth on that night.

358
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,600
That night,

359
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,390
your daughter Chunyu

360
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:11,230
came home to visit you on the surface.

361
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,510
In fact,

362
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,920
she and Chu Lei had decided

363
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,680
to elope overnight.

364
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,110
Chu Lei

365
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,680
entered Chunyu's bedroom

366
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,440
through here

367
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,200
so that they could meet.

368
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,080
When Chu Lei

369
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,390
was climbing,

370
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,270
the drunk Loong

371
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,990
suddenly passed by.

372
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,920
Chu Lei.

373
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,840
When I climbed up,

374
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,080
Loong saw me.

375
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,040
What shall we do then?

376
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,270
Can we still leave?

377
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,230
It might not be a bad thing.

378
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,630
At that time,

379
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,920
he came up with a plan.

380
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,080
Chu Lei

381
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:04,560
climbed out

382
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,040
carrying a paper effigy

383
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,990
from Xiao's Dyeing House,

384
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,390
which was made by Chunyu.

385
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:11,920
He wanted

386
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,470
Loong

387
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,840
to see

388
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,600
he had abducted

389
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,630
Chunyu.

390
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,510
He did so

391
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:26,040
to protect Chunyu's reputation.

392
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,320
A married woman

393
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,720
eloped with someone.

394
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,230
That would be a terrible thing to hear

395
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,040
if it got out.

396
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,800
That explains one thing.

397
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:39,080
You found Chunyu's room was a mess.

398
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,990
But you were so close.

399
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:44,630
Yet you didn't hear any noise.

400
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,760
Where were you when it happened?

401
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,790
I was in the next room.

402
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,270
How come you didn't hear the commotion

403
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,430
in your daughter's room?

404
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,390
Chunyu was married at that time.

405
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,960
How could she possibly do

406
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,270
something so out of line?

407
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,640
Magistrate,

408
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,600
don't ruin my daughter's innocence.

409
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,960
Shopkeeper Xiao,

410
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,390
do you know

411
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,640
after Chunyu married into the Lang family,

412
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,720
she never slept

413
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,910
with her husband?

414
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,480
You...

415
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,190
You knew it.

416
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,550
You knew it.

417
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,880
You must know

418
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,880
another thing.

419
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,360
That night,

420
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,240
Chunyu left

421
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,760
with all her valuable belongings.

422
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,430
You would know it after checking it.

423
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,640
Chunyu and Chu Lei

424
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,880
must have eloped.

425
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,480
You hid all the facts,

426
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,670
leading to Chu Lei's imprisonment.

427
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:15,910
Chunyu

428
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,640
is still missing.

429
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,150
Well,

430
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,720
were you protecting

431
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,510
your daughter's reputation

432
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,310
or saving your own face?

433
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:31,790
I...

434
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:32,910
Look at this.

435
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,980
[Chunyu]

436
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,030
Chunyu?

437
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:46,910
I found this

438
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,960
on Loong's table.

439
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:51,960
That night,

440
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,480
Loong accidentally saw the figure

441
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,430
on the second floor
of Xiao's Dyeing House

442
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,510
and saw through Chu Lei's plan.

443
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,310
Then

444
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,840
evil thoughts crept into his mind.

445
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,550
When Chunyu saw him putting out the light,

446
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,760
she went out secretly

447
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,480
with her bag

448
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,880
according to their plan.

449
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,360
[Xiao's Dyeing House]

450
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,030
[Xiao's Dyeing House]
At this time,

451
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,240
Loong saw there was no one around.

452
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,430
He pounced on Chunyu

453
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,550
and dragged her into his meat shop.

454
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:26,960
What do you want to do?

455
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,510
Are you planning to elope
with your secret lover?

456
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,840
If you make out with me...

457
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,510
He didn't know

458
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,720
Chunyu's earring

459
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,030
fell in the street.

460
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,880
Later, Chu Lei waited a long time

461
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,080
for Chunyu but didn't see her.

462
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,240
He came back to look for her.

463
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,790
Outside the meat shop,

464
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,720
he picked up Chunyu's earring.

465
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,910
After the incident,

466
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,510
Loong accused him of guilt.

467
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,880
You helped

468
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,670
put Chu Lei in jail.

469
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,190
Later on,

470
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,080
Loong sold Chunyu's belongings one by one.

471
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,600
Good thing he couldn't read much.

472
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,550
He didn't know

473
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,120
[Chunyu]
the two characters Chunyu.

474
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,270
So,

475
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,910
the cloth-wrapper was kept

476
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,120
[Chunyu]
and was used to wipe knives

477
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,360
[Chunyu]
and wrap meat.

478
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,190
My daughter!

479
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:30,000
My daughter!

480
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,000
Chunyu.

481
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,510
Shopkeeper Xiao,

482
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,960
you might never expect

483
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,190
that the murderer

484
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,640
who killed your daughter

485
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,640
lived across the street

486
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,550
from Xiao's Dyeing House.

487
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,600
Shopkeeper Xiao,

488
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,360
you covered it up deliberately,

489
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,030
so the real murderer

490
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,880
went free.

491
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,190
A good man

492
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,240
died in his boots.

493
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,790
Loong has died

494
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,120
and can't be punished.

495
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:15,000
Do you know you are guilty?

496
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,510
Yes, I'm guilty.

497
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,880
I'm guilty.

498
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,080
Take him away.

499
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,080
My daughter...

500
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,310
Magistrate,

501
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,960
your way of solving the case
is really clever.

502
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,880
Well,

503
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,030
Chunyu's case has been solved.

504
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,390
But what does it mean

505
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:22,760
for Chu Lei's five-day deadline?

506
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,480
Cases

507
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,310
should be solved one by one.

508
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,670
As for the five-day deadline,

509
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,150
just spend every and each day.

510
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,480
Heiyan showed up at Lin Fan's house.

511
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,960
Did he just want to punish Lin Fan?

512
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,960
You killed Lin Fan?

513
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,150
He shouldn't have revealed my secret.

514
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,960
I have to somehow punish him.

515
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,840
It's very easy for Heiyan to kill a man.

516
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,030
Why did he spare Lin Fan's life?

517
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,600
Lin Fan.

518
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,880
Miss Cao,

519
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,000
I just passed by

520
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,390
and heard you were playing the instrument.

521
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,910
I couldn't help listening for a while.

522
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,390
If I've disturbed you,

523
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,120
please don't mind.

524
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,120
Please don't mind.

525
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,190
I don't mind.

526
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,720
How was the piece of music?

527
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,030
I'm a vulgar man.

528
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,640
I don't understand music.

529
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,960
But I feel it is pleasant to hear.

530
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,790
I can't explain why.

531
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,240
I already knew you were a scholar.

532
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,790
Why do you pretend to be a vulgar man?

533
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,150
Miss Cao,

534
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,600
if there is nothing else,

535
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:26,880
I will...

536
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,550
I want to see him

537
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,190
before the Magistrate meets him.

538
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,240
Who?

539
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,670
You know whom I'm talking about.

540
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,030
I also know

541
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,030
you can take me to him.

542
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,620
[Lanfang County Magistrate's Office]

543
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,150
Magistrate, we knew we were wrong.

544
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:46,910
We knew we were wrong.

545
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:47,430
Shut up.

546

Magistrate.

547
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:49,510
You

548
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,510
killed innocents.

549
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,640
You should be beheaded
according to the Code.

550
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:54,960
I have reported

551
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,910
the case to the Ministry of Justice.

552
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,190
You will be punished

553
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,840
according to the Tang Code.

554
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,360
Today

555
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,510
is the last day

556
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,150
of the five-day period defined by Heiyan.

557
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,150
I know

558
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,030
you

559
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,960
are all afraid of Heiyan.

560
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,760
You all intend

561
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,270
to get a Heiyan tattoo.

562
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,790
I am incompetent.

563
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,030
I still

564
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,120
don't know

565
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,550
who Heiyan is,

566
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:29,150
nor do I know

567
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,150
what Heiyan

568
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:32,840
is up to.

569
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,910
I can understand

570
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,510
you are afraid of Heiyan.

571
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,310
Heiyan made it clear on the notice

572
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,270
that people without a Heiyan tattoo

573
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,150
would be killed.

574
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,510
Fine.

575
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,720
The Magistrate's Office

576
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,510
[Lanfang County Magistrate's Office]
has prepared

577
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,240
a strip of cloth with Heiyan's mark

578
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:55,960
for everyone.

579
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,350
In this way, everyone

580
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,190
is Heiyan now.

581
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:00,880
Heiyan

582
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,400
can't kill any innocents then.

583
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,230
They can't kill anyone

584
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,310
who is a member of Heiyan.

585
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,190
From today on,

586
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,640
among all the people in Lanfang County,

587
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,160
only I, Di Renjie,

588
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,710
have no Heiyan's mark on me.

589
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,800
If they want to kill someone,

590
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,800
just kill me.

591
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,550
If

592
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,590
Chu Lei

593
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,680
still avoids me,

594
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,400
he will lose.

595
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,520
Magistrate,

596
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:40,280
you are putting yourself in danger.

597
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,350
I just want to leave him no other choice.

598
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,070
He can only meet me.

599
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,190
Almost everyone in Tongkang Village

600
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,520
was slaughtered.

601
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,040
There is only one survivor.

602
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,310
He still did it.

603
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,520
Just because Chunyu

604
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,120
married into the Lang family.

605
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,310
He did not do it

606
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,590
just for personal revenge.

607
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,280
Chunyu's case

608
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,230
was the beginning of the series of things.

609
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,590
The murder case of Mr. Chen (the Sixth)
and his wife,

610
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,000
Loong's case,

611
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,920
and the tragic case of Tongkang Village...

612
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,640
Also, the five-day deadline
in Lanfang County...

613
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,680
What does he get

614
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,000
out of it?

615
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,920
He wants nothing from it.

616
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,470
He isn't doing it for personal gain.

617
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,550
He just wants Lanfang County

618
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,760
to be what he wants it to be.

619
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,550
Magistrate.

620
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,640
Magistrate,

621
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,590
something happened.

622
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,040
Miss Cao is missing.

623
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,120
Magistrate,

624
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,240
the runner of the Magistrate's Office

625
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,960
guarding the gate said Miss Cao left

626
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,600
about two hours ago.

627
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,080
Why didn't he tell us earlier?

628
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,030
Maybe it's because
Miss Cao often goes out.

629
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,910
So he didn't see
anything unusual about it.

630
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,150
But the situation is different now!

631
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,240
Huaiying,

632
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,150
what did she say in the letter?

633
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,510
She wants to quell the chaos

634
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,840
in Lanfang County on her own.

635
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,760
How could she have such an idea?

636
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,270
What's her relationship with Di Ying?

637
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,150
He just taught her how to play music.

638
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,080
How could Di Ying listen to her?

639
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,310
I'll figure this out.

640
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,000
Lin Fan.

641
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,910
He took Cao An away.

642
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,190
Cao An has Heiyan's mark on her.

643
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,720
He won't break his promise, will he?

644
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,390
He won't.

645
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,640
You've solved all the mysteries.

646
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,550
Take me to him.

647
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,670
Okay.

648
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,880
Just we two.

649
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,030
Okay.

650
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,750
Aren't you afraid this is a trap?

651
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:04,960
You are with me.

652
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,590
I'm not afraid.

653
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,310
Have you thought about one issue?

654
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,550
Why is the difference in character

655
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,200
between the Chu Lei I described

656
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,120
and the Chu Lei you analyzed so great?

657
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,510
I don't think

658
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,830
the difference is great.

659
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,350
Would the Chu Lei I described

660
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,400
let Loong

661
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,200
live those ten years?

662
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,270
Why did the Chu Lei you described

663
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,070
take revenge after ten years?

664
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:35,680
Exactly.

665
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,680
Because Chunyu,

666
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,830
Loong,

667
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:43,240
or all the people in Tongkang Village

668
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,030
had nothing to do with him.

669
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,550
Why did he commit the crimes then?

670
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,070
Because of me.

671
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,160
Because it was fun.
