66
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,440

won't you also burn your love

71

There's another layer inside.

85

The picture of murdering the wife

86

was painted with special pigment.

87

When it's exposed to hot water,

88
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,240
it will show up.

89
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,760
I scraped off the special pigment

90
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,880
so the original picture

91
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,400
was revealed.

That day,

93
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,320
you threw a bowl of hot medicine on it

94
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,800
and created

95
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,680
a shocking picture

of murdering the wife.

97
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,880
That day, I had an attack of madness.

00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,960
I lost my mind and don't remember.

99
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,120
Did you really

100
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,000
have an attack of madness?

101
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,160
What else?

102
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,080
Are you saying

103
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,640
I deliberately threw the medicine

104
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,840
on the screen?

105
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,480
That's what I meant.

106
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,160
You first made the screen change

107
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,360
and spread the rumor
about the evil spirits.

108
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,360
Then,

109
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,480
you let the madness take over,

110
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,440
lost your mind,

111
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,600
and killed Yinlian.

112
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,760
Mr. Teng,

113
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,080
this is your plan.

114
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,400
To kill Mrs. Yinlian

115
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,760
and get what you desire.

116
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,720

will all

121

be on your side.

122
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,360
Yinlian was killed by Li Han.

123
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,440
That's your verdict, Magistrate.

124
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,600
I said

125
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,200
the truth would come out
when we find Li Han,

126
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,040
but I didn't ask you to silence him.

127
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,520
If it's true that Li Han

128
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,160
killed her for revenge,

129
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,600
why did he go through all the trouble

130
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,160
to let the screen change?

131
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,240
Why did I need to kill Yinlian?

132
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,240
I asked you

133
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,560
who made this screen.

134
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,920
Just an unknown artist.

135
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,760
Why ask again?

136
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,720
It's not because the painter is unknown,

137
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,640
but you don't want to tell me

138
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
the painter's name, right?

139
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,480
Is that Mrs. Yinlian

140
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,280
in the picture?

141
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,280
Xu Kai.

142
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,360
Why are you here?

143
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,040
Come...

144
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,040
It's a little messy here.

145
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,320
It's fine.

146
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,360
Pretty good.

147
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,200
Are you done with the screen?

148
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:43,920
Almost done.

149
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,520
This is...

150
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,920
a success in the imperial examination.

151
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,520
What is portrayed

152
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,960
is like a story.

153
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,360
This is

154
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,240
our story.

155
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,280
Does this screen

156
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,800
have a name?

157
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,600
Let's call it

158
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,360
the Four-panel Screen.

159
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,160
The woman in the lacquer screen

160
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,360
is also her.

161
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,320
However, the man

162
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,760
is not you

163
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,960
but the painter Xu Kai.

164
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,670
So you're saying

165
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,760
the one who should've been
with her for years

166
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,400
is this Xu Kai.

167
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,200
Where is he?

168
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,520
You killed him.

169
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,240
Seven stabs.

170
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,240
Mrs. Yinlian

171
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,240
was also

172
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,360
stabbed seven times.

173
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,440
A coincidence?

174
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,520
I don't think so.

175
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,760
But I didn't figure it out

176
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,200
until I found seven scratches

177
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,440
on the wall outside the private room

178
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,240
of the brothel.

179
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,440
You stalked Mrs. Yinlian's
secret rendezvous with Xu Kai.

180
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,160
Seven times in total.

181
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,960
One time,

182
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,400
one stab.

183
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,840
Take a good look at my nails.

184
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,000
What scratches are there?

185
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,960
Nothing!

186
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,280
The nails have grown back.

187
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,840
But that day,

188
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,680
when I examined your pulse,

189
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,400
I did see the wear and tear of your nails.

190
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,400
Unfortunately, at that time,

191
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,240
I didn't doubt what you were saying.

192
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,040
Shut up!

193
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,440
Don't say anything without evidence.

194
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,760
Di Renjie,

195
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,040
it doesn't matter if you accuse me.

196
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,400
If you accuse Yinlian

197
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,920
of adultery,

198
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,720
I won't spare you.

199
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,880
I've never been able to figure this out.

200
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,000
I didn't understand

201
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,880
how a man could endure such humiliation

202
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,720
until I found your poem

203
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,960
in Mrs. Yinlian's room.

204
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,760
The old mountains stand,
yet my bonds no longer cling.

205
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,200
Embarking on a journey to Chang'an
to enjoy the late spring.

206
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,800
A tree draped in pear blossoms,
a stream beneath moonlight.

207
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,400
I wonder who owns this sight tonight.

208
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,720
You said you were revising

209
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,960
Mrs. Yinlian's poem for her.

210
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,040
The old mountains exist,
yet my bonds no longer cling.

211
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,080
Embarking on a journey to Chang'an
to see the late spring.

212
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,480
You put your mark

213
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,040
on Mrs. Yinlian's poem and tried

214
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,360
to take it as your own.

215
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,360
But unfortunately,

216
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,880
after all your efforts,

217
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,880
it's not

218
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,280
as good as the original.

219
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,280
Di Renjie,

220
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,320
you're just a poor scholar
with a classicist degree.

221
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,280
You have no right to judge my poetry.

222
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,360
I indeed have no talent for poetry,

223
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,280
but I'm not one

224
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,240
who fish for fame either.

225
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,320
Someone told me

226
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,760
that love and romance

227
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,800
are simple.

228
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,040
It's strong while being together.

229
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,680
It's intense while missing.

230
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,880
Separation creates sorrow.

231
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,120
Infatuation creates suspicion.

232
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,640
Passionate incurs jealousy and hatred.

233
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,960
These feelings

234
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,200
are depicted to the fullest

235
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,480
in your poetry.

236
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,800
Your poetry is soft and sentimental,

237
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,800
more vivid

238
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,840
than a woman's thoughts.

239
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,240
Now that I think about it,

240
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,120
it's not that you're more delicate
than women,

241
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,240
but these poems

242
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,320
were written by a woman.

243
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,880
If not,

244
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,800
why did you know

245
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,480
that Mrs. Yinlian was having an affair
with her old lover

246
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,920
but still put up with it?

247
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,680
It's just because you need

248
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,920
Mrs. Yinlian's poems more
than anyone else.

249
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,920
Xu Kai.

250
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,200
Let's call it

251
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,880
the Four-panel Screen.

252
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,240
What is portrayed

253
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,680
is like a story.

254
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,240
This is our story.

255
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,600
Di Renjie,

256
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,120
get out of here.

257
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,160
I remember you said

258
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,240
you never used

259
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,680
that horsewhip

260
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,880
since your army days.

261
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,360
This horsewhip

262
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,000
is what I used back then.

263
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,240
Ever since I left office,

264
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,200
I've kept it with me.

265
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,560
It commemorates

266
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,640
my years of military service.

267
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,080
What about the fresh blood

268
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,520
on the end of the whip?

269
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,880
Dare to show your backside

270
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,400
for everyone to see?

271
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,040
Fingernails can grow,

272
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,520
but whip marks

273
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,920
can't disappear once left.

274
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,080
You whipped yourself
with the horsewhip every day,

275
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,160
trying to subdue your inner demons.

276
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,480
But in the end,

277
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,480
you couldn't bear it anymore.

278
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,240
You first killed Xu Kai.

279
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:07,960
Then,

280
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,720
you pretended to be mad

281
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,560
and killed Yinlian.

282
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,960
You said I was faking my madness?

283
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,720
In your study,

284
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,320
we found Bimanzi.

285
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,480
Bimanzi,

286
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,800
a small amount of it

287
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,440
can make one show the symptoms of madness.

288
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,440
To kill Yinlian,

289
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,600
you took it for more than ten days,

290
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,160
which confirmed your madness.

291
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,040
If I really wanted to kill my wife,

292
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,200
why did I do that?

293
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,080
In the beginning,

294
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,680
you didn't want to get blood
on your hands,

295
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,720
so you bribed the director

296
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,800
to release Li Han.

297
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,620
[Li Han]

298
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,080
Your words are getting
even more ridiculous.

299
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,280
I'm Teng Kan.

300
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,880
Everyone knows me in Penglai.

301
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,000
If I go to the quarry for one's release,

302
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,560
the director will surely recognize me.

303
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,160
Call the director here.

304
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,880
I'll confront him.

305
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,400
When did I mention the quarry?

306
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,560
That's right.

307
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,640
He didn't say it.

308
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,280
How do you know that Li Han

309
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,640
was serving in the quarry?

310
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,240
It's not hard to deduce.

311
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,680
Call the director here.

312
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,920
I'll confront him face-to-face.

313
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,280
No need for a confrontation.

314
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,560
The one who went to the quarry

315
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,600
was indeed not you

316
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,440
but

317
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,480
Ms. Lai Er,

318
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,360
Yinlian's sister.

319
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,200
Why did she do this?

320
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,600
You should ask her,

321
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,720
not me.

322
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,080
You know exactly why.

323
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,440
Mrs. Yinlian

324
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,680
always went out

325
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,800
in the name of visiting Ms. Lai Er.

326
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,360
The butler

327
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,440
can testify to this.

328
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,320
Had Mr.s Yinlian and Ms. Lai Er always
been seeing each other?

329
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,960
Not really.

330
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,280
I've heard they used to have a deep grudge

331
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,280
against each other.

332
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,840
It was only recently

333
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,080
that they began to see each other again.

334
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,600
If you knew they were at odds,

335
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,200
then

336
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,280
you'd realize Mrs. Yinlian
must've been lying.

337
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,640
You knew Ms. Lai Er loved Xu Kai deeply.

338
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,120
And after recovering from leprosy,

339
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,760
Xu Kai rekindled his relationship
with Yinlian.

340
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,320
You used her jealousy to get her

341
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,080
to pay for Li Han's release.

342
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,960
If it weren't for Li Han to thwart you,

343
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,400
you'd have succeeded.

344
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,360
He knew that after you killed Xu Kai,

345
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,040
- you'd kill your wife.
- Evil spirit...

346
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,680
Evil spirit...

347

So he could only sneak
into your residence repeatedly

You knew he didn't dare to report it,

and imprisoned due to Yinlian,

You've framed me like this.

Now,

380
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,160
you should consider the consequences.

381
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:54,040
I thought you once dominated
the realm of poetry

382
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,240
with your genuine talent.

383
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,830
How could you end up like this?

384

Three people have died because of you.

brought one red cedar tree
from the remote Jiannan Circuit

00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,120
That's true.

519
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:33,920
Huaiying.

520
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:34,920
Guanshi.

521
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,140
[Hou Yu, courtesy name Guan Shi]

522
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,720
Since you left the capital,

523
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:39,960
it's been over a year.

524
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,920
I still remember

525
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,200
seeing you off
outside the Beihuan Pavilion.

526
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,880
The fallen flowers outside the pavilion

527
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,240
were melancholy.

528
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,000
At that time, I wondered

529
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,560
when

530
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,920
and where

531
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,640
I'd meet you again.

532
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,000
Aren't I doing fine here

533
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,760
in this remote seaside city?

534
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,680
You've lost weight.

535
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,880
Why have you lost so much weight?

536
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,680
With the Empress in power,

537
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,320
many officials
are either demoted or deposed.

538
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:11,920
I was no exception.

539
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,200
Let's not talk about it.

540
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,040
When I heard one
from the Ministry of Justice

541
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,920
would accompany Commissioner Liu
to Penglai,

542
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,920
I was thinking

543
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,520
how nice it'd be you.

544
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,480
To my surprise...

545
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,320
It's me.

546
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,640
I was going

547
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,680
to meet you after the banquet
with Commissioner Liu.

548
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,320
Why

549
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,760
did I run into you here?

550
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,120
I'm here

551
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,840
to find a shipowner named Gu Mengbin.

552
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,160
For a small case,

553
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,480
I've been summoning him for three days,

554
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,280
but he's been evading me.

555
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,800
Gu Mengbin.

556
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,360
What a coincidence.

557
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,200
He's holding the banquet tonight.

558
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,480
Mr. Gu is here.

559
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,840
Mr. Gu is here.

560
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,460
[Gu Mengbin]

561
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,240
Tai,

562
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,240
look over there.

563
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,480
The Gu family made a really big scene.

564
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,560
He's the biggest shipowner in Penglai.

565
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,640
The hundreds of ships

566
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,040
in and out of the harbor are all his.

567
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,880
His ships can sail to Japan

568
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,880
and Baekje.

569
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,160
You guys,

570
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,760
go in and clean up.

571
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,000
Hurry up.

572
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:22,760
Master.

573
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,000
Director Yi.

574
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,200
Such goodies.
Why are you taking them away?

575
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,960
Director Yi,

576
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,240
tonight, in front of Commissioner Liu,

577
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,320
don't mention gold,

578
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,160
Especially not the words "Baekje gold".

579
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,440
What are they moving into the tent?

580
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,680
I can't see it.

581
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,920
It must be some kind of treasure

582
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:15,000
[Penglai Harbor]

583
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,800
Quick...

584
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,760
Let's set the lanterns.

585
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,840
[Commissioner Liu]

586
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,280
I've been told

587
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,160
that you grew up by the sea
before you joined the palace

588
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,680
to serve His Majesty and Empress,

589
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,600
so I've taken the liberty
of setting this banquet here.

590
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,840
I hope you enjoy your drink.

591
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,120
Mr. Gu, I've heard

592
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,600
you're very thoughtful.

593
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,960
It seems that you've already

594
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,680
found out everything about me.

595
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,560
I wouldn't dare.

596
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,760
Commissioner,

597
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,920
I am in charge of goods
coming in from overseas

598
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,200
in the Commission of Maritime Trade.

599
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,360
I was wondering what you want

600
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,880
to purchase this time.

601
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,480
That depends on what Penglai has.

602
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,000
It's just a few meager items.

603
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,440
I'm afraid they won't meet the eyes
of His Majesty and the Empress.

604
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,000
Commissioner Liu,

605
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,000
please take a look.

606
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,280
I'm of little education.

607
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,960
I only like two things in life.

608
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,160
First,

609
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,520
enjoy songs.

610
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,440
Second,

611
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,840
gold.

612
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,480
Commissioner,

613
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,670
you're joking.

614
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,800
Penglai doesn't produce it.

615
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,670
However,

616
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,600
Mr. Gu

617
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,040
has prepared performers for you.

618
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,080
It's right outside.

619
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:07,630
It's right outside.

620
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,150
Gu...

621
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,670
Mr. Gu

622
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,150
has also prepared you some little gifts.

623
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,120
I hope you'll accept them.

624
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,120
Wait.

625
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:43,880
Who is it?

626
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,600
You don't have eyes?

627
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,720
You don't know Magistrate Di?

628
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,320
I'm ignorant.

629
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,440
Magistrate, please forgive me.

630
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,520
Magistrate,

631
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,800
it was this agent named Bai Kai.

632
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,080
He's been trying

633
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,480
to stop me from finding Mr. Gu.

634
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,880
It must be a misunderstanding.

635
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,400
I wouldn't dare.

636
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,800
Stand still.

637
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,320
You stand up.

638
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,360
You. Stand up.

639
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,240
Ms. Cao.

640
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,680
Magistrate Di.

641
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,680
Commissioner Liu,

642
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,760
the magistrate of Penglai, Di Renjie,
is here to see you.

643
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,360
This is a reception for Commissioner Liu
by the director of maritime trade.

644
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,680
Why is he here?

645
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,920
I've heard that Di Renjie

646
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,280
and Deputy Secretary Hou are old friends.

647
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,440
Commissioner Liu,

648
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,320
I

649
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,640
do know Di Renjie from school.

650
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,560
I also heard

651
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,640
that even the Empress

652
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,000
appreciates him a lot.

653
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:45,760
Yes.

654
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,400
But in my opinion,

655
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,600
he's active by nature.

656
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,360
Back in the captain,

657
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,080
he hated paperwork.

658
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,560
So by order of the Empress,

659
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,920
He is applying his talents in Penglai.

660
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,600
Invite Magistrate Di to come in.

661
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,680
Yes.

662
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,320
Magistrate Di, please come in.

663
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,000
I am Di Renjie.

664
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,520
Greetings, Commissioner Liu,

665
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,040
Deputy Secretary Hou,

666
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,360
and Director Yi.

667
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,760
The director of maritime trade
is a fifth-ranked official,

668
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,720
higher than a seventh-ranked magistrate.

669
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,040
Have a seat.

670
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,880
I heard

671
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,760
Magistrate Di is active by nature.

672
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,640
You didn't come here

673
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,160
in the dark

674
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,200
to get a drink, right?

675
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,720
You came here from the capital.

676
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,200
I am sorry to have missed the welcome.

677
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,320
Don't say such polite things.

678
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
I'm of little education.

679
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,000
I guess Magistrate Di must

680
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,840
be here on official business.

681
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,480
Deputy Secretary Hou holds you
in high regard.

682
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,360
So I'm curious.

683
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,440
I've never seen

684
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,760
a magistrate judge a case.

685
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,280
If you're on official business,

686
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,560
do it here.

687
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,600
Let me take a look.

688
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,280
I'll do as I'm told.

689
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,640
Commissioner Liu,

690
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,840
let's enjoy songs first.

691
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,960
Performers come in.

692
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,440
Thank you, Ms. Cao.

693
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,800
The man in this painting is Wang Lide.

694
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,640
It's said

695
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,920
he's an agent working for Mr. Gu,
who is in charge

696
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,080
of the transshipment of overseas goods.

697
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,160
Magistrate Di,

698
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,680
I've told the man you sent.

699
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,280
This agent is not my man.

700
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,800
Ms. Cao,

701
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,320
play a song for Commissioner Liu.

702
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,440
This drum in your arms

703
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,560
looks very special.

704
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,680
I've never seen it before.

705
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,560
I'm Qiao Tai.

706
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,880
May I have your name?

707
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,040
[Yusu]
My name is Yusu.

708
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,560
Your accent...

709
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,920
I'm from Baekje.

710
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,080
Officer, mind your own business.

711
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,680
I'm talking to Ms. Yusu.

712
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,840
What's it to you?

713
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,080
Unfortunately,

714
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,080
all the performers here

715
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,480
are booked by us tonight.

716
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,840
It's not a big deal to be rich.

717
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,080
Get out.

718
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,400
It's not a big deal to a sidekick.

719
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,560
Wait for me.

720
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:42,720
A few days ago,

721
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,760
the magistral office received a report

722
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,480
that a store

723
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,960
was overdue for rent.

724
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,120
After investigation,

725
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,880
it's the man in the painting.

726
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,280
He's gone to sea a few months ago

727
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,440
and was scheduled to return last month,

728
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,600
but hasn't returned yet.

729
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:55,680
So

730
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,160
I sent someone to check with Mr. Gu.

731
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,200
Rent arrears

732
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,920
are just a small amount of money.

733
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,680
Why should Mr. Gu be disturbed?

734
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,400
That's very true, Commissioner.

735
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,560
It's just

736
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,080
that the cargo we found

737
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,880
is not a small deal.

738
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,840
It's the Modao.
