5
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,840
Huaiying.

6
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,080
You're still alive.

7
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,720
Gold.

8
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,440
You see.

9
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,720
Quite a lot.

10
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,880
I found them all.

11
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,400
Come on, do me a favor.

12
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,440
This case

13
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,480
is solved.

14
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,360
We solved it.

15
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,600
Do me a favor.

16
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,120
Come on.

17
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,520
You threw the box into the sea.

18
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,320
How is that possible?

19
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,640
Stop lying.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,440
This is not a gold smuggling case.

21
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,400
This is an arms trafficking case.

22
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,880
Gold is only for trading.

23
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,240
When did you start to suspect me?

24
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,560
Since Yusu left that word in my hand.

25
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,000
All the clues

26
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,040
are connected.

27
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,960
With one word,

28
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,160
and you conclude that I'm the murderer.

29
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,520
Plus this box of gold,

30
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,360
isn't that enough?

31
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,840
In Penglai,

32
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,360
Wang Lide helped Baekje people
with arms trafficking.

33
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,760
The sellers of the weapons

34
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,680
are officials who oppose Her Majesty.

35
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,720
And you

36
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,360
are the middleman they chose.

37
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,120
For a long time,

38
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,720
your smuggling channels
are unobstructed.

39
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,320
You even taught him

40
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,440
the score notation in the capital,

41
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,880
which aids your communication
when smuggling gold.

42
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,440
But this time,

43
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,760
Wang Lide is in trouble.

44
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,720
Heiyan's men found him.

45
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,240
They asked him

46
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,560
to rob this gold.

47
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,520
He knows

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,560
exchanging gold for weapons

49
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,320
will involve the privileged.

50
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,640
He can't offend them.

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,240
But Heiyan's men are cruel.

52
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,160
He dared not say no, either.

53
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,910
He thought about it.

54
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,440
Then he decided to confess to you.

55
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,440
He asked you for help.

56
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,600
What happened?

57
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,320
Brother Yu.

58
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,960
Two days ago, Heiyan's men found me.

59
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,800
They said they would
rob our gold on the ship.

60
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,560
And promised to give me a share.

61
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,120
If I don't say yes,

62
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,080
I'm afraid...

63
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,040
I

64
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,440
will die.

65
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,120
He wants to ask you
to use the power of the privileged

66
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,880
to kick Heiyan's men out of Penglai.

67
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,080
In this way,

68
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,840
he can continue to smuggle gold.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,680
But after you heard it,

70
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,400
you got another evil idea.

71
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,920
You and Wang Lide

72
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,840
made an appointment
at a place in the sea.

73
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,880
That place

74
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,640
is your secret with him.

75
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,680
There're three copies
of the nautical chart.

76
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,760
One for you and one for Wang Lide.

77
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,960
Heiyan also got one.

78
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,960
It's just that there is no such place

79
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,840
on Heiyan's nautical chart.

80
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,760
That's where you were going

81
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,360
to take all the gold by yourself.

82
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,760
Wang Lide followed your plan.

83
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,560
He stunned Heiyan's sailors.

84
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,960
Wang Lide stopped
at the island on his way,

85
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,960
waiting for the time agreed with you.

86
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,120
But when you got on board,

87
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,240
he discovered that

88
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,720
you didn't bring a single soldier.

89
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,040
He became suspicious of you.

90
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,680
Why do you come alone?

91
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,560
Where are your men?

92
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,000
They are all on the big ship behind.

93
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:25,880
They will be here shortly.

94
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,880
Everything in the cabin is taken care of.

95
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,640
Where's the gold?

96
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,840
This way.

97
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,200
Why did you put it here?

98
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,960
More noticeable, less suspicious.

99
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,480
How come your men haven't come yet?

100
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,440
If Heiyan finds out,

101
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,960
we are done.

102
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,120
Wang Lide.

103
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Wang Lide's fall
into the sea was an accident.

104
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,400
But you were not worried.

105
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,680
In fact,

106
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,680
Wang Lide drifted to the island at sea

107
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,720
and lived a few more days.

108
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,640
It was really not a threat to you.

109
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,440
What you were waiting for

110
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,680
is a big tide.

111
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,360
You were waiting for the ebb tide,

112
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,480
when you could come
to the trench to get back the gold.

113
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,640
What I didn't expect is

114
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,120
that you are so proficient in tides.

115
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,960
In fact, about tides and stars,

116
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,440
I also know a thing or two.

117
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,760
You were planning

118
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,120
to take the largest sum of gold

119
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,400
smuggled from Baekje by yourself.

120
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,640
On one hand,

121
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,400
the weapons were not lost.

122
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,720
You have something to
explain to the officials.

123
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,120
On the other hand,

124
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,520
you made it look

125
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,280
like it's Heiyan who robbed the gold.

126
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,600
So you won't be chased after
by the Baekje people.

127
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,400
For such a big business,

128
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,240
you only need to get rid of Wang Lide.

129
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,640
Still, it's a pity.

130
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,600
What you didn't expect is

131
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,960
the chain of accidents that followed.

132
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,080
You didn't expect

133
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,000
there was also a stowaway
from Baekje hiding on the ship.

134
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,680
This skinny man

135
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,880
said he saw Heiyan's men.

136
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,200
On a sailor,

137
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,480
I've seen a weird tattoo.

138
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,520
Heiyan didn't get the gold

139
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,280
and lost ten of his sailors.

140
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,840
He was infuriated already.

141
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,640
What's worse,
their whereabouts were exposed.

142
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,400
They were wanted by the court.

143
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,640
So,

144
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,320
they sent Jin Sang

145
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,760
pretending to be a survivor.

146
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,840
His confession involved
all dignitaries of Penglai.

147
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,800
One of them

148
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,880
is the shipmaster surnamed Gu.

149
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,760
- The ship is his.
- Nonsense!

150
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,880
This is a false charge.

151
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,200
There is also an official surnamed Yi.

152
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,680
You are talking nonsense!

153
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,720
Then Heiyan deliberately
offered a nautical chart

154
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,480
to lead us

155
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,680
to the sea.

156
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,120
In fact, at that time,

157
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,960
I haven't thought it could be you.

158
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,600
When people are trapped at sea,

159
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,360
some of the original secrets

160
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,320
can't be hidden any longer.

161
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,400
That's strange.

162
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,760
As we just set sail,

163
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,520
someone sabotaged the sail.

164
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,240
Out of the way!

165
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,000
I've been thinking about it.

166
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,280
I think he is afraid

167
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,360
of gold being found.

168
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,480
In another word,

169
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,760
he is also afraid of being found by me

170
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,760
who

171
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,160
is smuggling gold.

172
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,160
The first one
to show his trail is Yi Pan.

173
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,680
He can't explain

174
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,880
why that night

175
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,080
he would leave the port with the
Director of Maritime Trade's ship.

176
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,560
I don't know how you manipulated Yi Pan

177
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,360
so he'd serve you.

178
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,040
I guess

179
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,400
there are only two reasons.

180
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,880
First, in the name of handling cases
by the Ministry of Punishments.

181
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,840
Second,

182
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,560
he didn't check the gold ships before

183
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,200
and took advantage of it.

184
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,960
And this

185
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,640
helps you to blackmail him.

186
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,120
Someone tried to kill Director Yi and me.

187
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,000
On the night of the gold ship's accident,

188
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,640
Director Yi accompanied
a mysterious man out of the sea.

189
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,800
He refused to say who the man was.

190
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,800
He said he would be dead
if he let out the secret.

191
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,480
Mr. Gu.

192
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,520
Is that you?

193
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,440
On the ship,

194
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,880
the secret was hard to keep unknown.

195
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,800
So,

196
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,160
you strangled Yi Pan.

197
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,120
You made his death look like a suicide.

198
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,880
Gu Mengbin might not know your secret.

199
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,960
But Yi Pan's death frightened him.

200
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,880
You were afraid
that Gu Mengbin knew something.

201
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,560
So,

202
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
you shot an arrow in the back

203
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,360
and killed him.

204
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,560
To cover up the secrets of gold,

205
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,400
you've become so frenzied.

206
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,280
Di Renjie

207
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
collaborated with the enemies.

208
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,670
Get your arrows ready.

209
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,320
Go.

210
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,790
It never occurred to me

211
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,040
the last person you wanted to kill

212
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,960
is me.

213
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,560
Why?

214
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,480
Why this case of gold

215
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,880
turned my friend into a demon?

216
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,840
This box of gold

217
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,360
can get me back what I want.

218
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,480
Do you understand?

219
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,120
Hong Liang.

220
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,720
Thank you for timely sending a ship
to rescue me.

221
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,080
This means as you just said,

222
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,800
Hou Yu calculated

223
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,680
when the tide would recede,

224
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,680
then he sank the gold

225
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,440
into the trench ahead of time.

226
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,640
Di Renjie's way of handling cases
is interesting.

227
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,200
I was mistaken to blame Magistrate Di.

228
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Commissioner.

229
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,680
The tide will soon rise.

230
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,800
Time is running out.

231
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,040
Go.

232
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,560
Send someone to meet him quickly.

233
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:37,960
You go.

234
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,240
Yes, sir.

235
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Give up the official behind you.

236
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,680
Come back with me and turn yourself in.

237
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,640
You shut up.

238
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,480
My family worked
for Tang for three generations.

239
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,680
My grandfather

240
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,880
taught me astronomy
and maritime affairs since I was a child.

241
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,120
He wanted me to be a prodigious talent.

242
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,120
But now that Her Majesty is in power,

243
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,800
I see no hope.

244
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,040
Those senior officials
who oppose Her Majesty

245
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,960
are all evil-minded.

246
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,120
They asked me to smuggle gold.

247
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,800
They let me associate
with people like Wang Lide.

248
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,000
What the heck os Wang Lide?

249
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,520
He's small time.

250
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,840
And I...

251
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,600
I have something greater to achieve.

252
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,840
Do you really think I value this gold?

253
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,520
It was Her Majesty who relieved me
of my official duties.

254
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,600
None of those senior officials

255
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,480
spoke for me.

256
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,400
They're all cowards.

257
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,800
You have no other choice
but to turn yourself in.

258
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,960
Huaiying,

259
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,360
we have another choice.

260
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,520
For this gold,

261
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,840
I won't keep any of it.

262
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,280
I will give it all away.

263
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,320
All those who died

264
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,560
are major criminals for gold smuggling.

265
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,400
We took them out.

266
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,000
They deserved to die.

267
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,360
They deserve the punishment.

268
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,080
This case was solved by you.

269
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,160
You can take this gold

270
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,960
and report to Her Majesty.

271
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,880
Huaiying, do you remember the time

272
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,160
when we were in the capital?

273
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,520
We were drinking and singing.

274
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
We were high-spirited.

275
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,360
We have great plans for the country.

276
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,960
Do you remember?

277
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,440
Help me out this time, will you?

278
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,240
Let me go.

279
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,000
Di Renjie.

280
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,160
Magistrate.

281
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,080
Magistrate.

282
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,280
The tide is rising.

283
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,200
Magistrate, hurry up.

284
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,080
Magistrate.

285
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,160
The tide is rising. Magistrate.

286
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,440
Hou Yu.

287
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,640
Hou Yu.

288
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,440
Di Renjie.

289
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,760
- Let's go, Magistrate.
- Di Renjie.

290
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,640
Magistrate, hurry up.

291
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,520
Magistrate.

292
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,760
Hou Yu.

293
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,320
Now I got this gold.

294
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,880
I can get my career back.

295
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,280
At that time

296
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,160
I am still elite of
the Ministry of Punishments.

297
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,400
Huaiying.

298
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,440
I'll be

299
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,920
the pillar of Tang.

300
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,200
I'll be

301
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,840
the pillar of Tang.

302
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,400
Here comes the tide.

303
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,720
The case of gold was solved.

304
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,600
Your Majesty,

305
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,480
from now on,

306
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,040
there will be no more smuggled gold

307
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,840
in the capital.

308
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,560
Hong.

309
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,640
You are in a hurry.

310
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,480
Where are you doing?

311
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,120
I have an appointment with Ms. Cao.

312
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,560
We will go to the temple to pray.

313
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,560
Go, go.

314
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,760
What's the matter?

315
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,560
Magistrate, got something on your mind?

316
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,960
Not at all.

317
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,160
Then why don't you say anything?

318
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,600
Today...

319
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,360
It's a good day.

320
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,120
It's rare.

321
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,240
Right?

322
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,680
Across the bridge,

323
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,520
it's just a short walk away
from the Buddhist temple.

324
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,040
Magistrate, do you believe in Buddhism?

325
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,000
No.

326
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,760
And you?

327
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,440
I believe in destiny in Buddhism.

328
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,600
Everything has its cause.

329
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,880
All joys and sorrows are
external circumstances.

330
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,320
Honor, disgrace, calamity, and fortune are

331
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,200
all karmas from past lives.

332
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,920
Even though they exist now,

333
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,240
they will return to nothingness
when the destiny ends.

334
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,200
So, not to be delighted, come what may.

335
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,720
Leave everything to destiny.

336
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,560
Magistrate, you said
you don't believe in Buddhism.

337
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,280
But what you just said

338
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,480
are all Buddhist teachings.

339
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,280
It's just hearsay.

340
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,000
You see.

341
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,800
There is a cherry tree there.

342
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,240
It's really a cherry tree.

343
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,720
It is growing on this cliff.

344
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,240
It's not easy.

345
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,000
The world enters eternal night.

346
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,480
Life and death are vast and boundless.

347
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,560
When I was a child,

348
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,760
my father is in distress.

349
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,520
My mother and I

350
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,480
were exiled to a remote and dry place.

351
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,560
We were hungry and thirsty.

352
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,720
Fortunately,

353
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,240
I met a cherry tree.

354
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,280
That's how we survived.

355
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,000
Speaking of which,

356
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,960
me and the cherry tree

357
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,000
are really destined.

358
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,960
Magistrate.

359
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,680
Magistrate.

360
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,760
That man.

361
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,120
That year,

362
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,400
a little girl's family

363
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,440
suffered a catastrophe.

364
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,640
That man

365
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,320
saved you.

366
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,120
That's why you came to Penglai.

367
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,920
You are here for him.

368
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,560
You want to find him.

369
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,520
Then today, why do you...

370
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,640
Faraway,

371
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,120
in fact, there is nothing.

372
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,400
Faraway

373
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,120
there could have something.

374
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,160
Huaiying.

375
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,800
Huaiying.

376
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,200
Please sit down.

377
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,560
Have some fruit.

378
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,080
I'll prepare dinner.

379
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,760
Stay for dinner.

380
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,960
Will you?

381
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,200
No need for that.

382
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,560
It's time for me to leave.

383
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,240
Please stay.

384
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,840
Have a meal and enjoy your time.

385
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,880
I heard you would stay for dinner.

386
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,880
We have nothing at home.

387
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,160
Stop pulling me.

388
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,760
What are you talking about?

389
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:43,760
Ms. Cao.

390
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,240
Hong wonders if there is

391
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,760
anything you don't like.

392
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:47,440
You...

393
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,920
Do you eat coriander?

394
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,960
They are strange today.

395
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,480
I don't know what happened to them.

396
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,440
They just

397
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,520
want to know what happened to us.

398
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,480
Then what happened to us?

399
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:25,920
For today,

400
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,520
thank you.

401
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,040
I didn't expect that

402
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,640
you'd really plant a cherry tree.

403
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:04,880
In this way,

404
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,480
when you want to eat cherries,

405
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,920
you can get it right here.

406
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,720
Do you know

407
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,000
it will take at least
three to four years

408
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,560
before a tree can bear fruit?

409
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,280
But it'll eventually bear fruit, won't it?

410

[Judge Dee's Mystery]
[Rain Master Legend]

411
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,440
Here's my pawn ticket.

412
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,240
Why don't you give it back?

413
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,360
You must return my bracelet today.

414
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:55,960
It must be returned to us.

415
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,120
What's happening?
It's loud in the morning.

416
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,440
What are you yelling about?

417
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,160
This is Yamen.

418
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,000
How dare you?

419
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,640
Yamen is exactly the place.

420
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,600
I want to see Magistrate.

421
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,520
Zhong's pawnshop is cheating.

422
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,160
[Penglai Yamen]
I want justice.

423
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,040
He won't give my bracelet back.

424
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,480
Shut up.

425
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,440
That's him.

426
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,280
Behave yourself.

427
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,360
Come on, stop it.

428
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,360
What's going on here?

429
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,440
Magistrate.

430
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,080
Magistrate.

431
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,200
Magistrate, you are just in time.

432
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,400
I want justice.

433
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,720
Six months ago, in Zhong's pawnshop,

434
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,040
I pawned a gold bracelet.

435
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,080
We agreed

436
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,400
on a period of six months.

437
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,600
Now the ticket is here.

438
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,160
It is in black and white.

[Pawn ticket]
Today is the last day of the period.

440
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,760
I've got enough money.

441
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,680
I want my bracelet back.

442
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,000
But they told me

443
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,320
the bracelet is missing.

444
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,120
Magistrate.

445
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,640
[Shopkeeper Lin]
The ticket is genuine.

446
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,000
The handwriting on it

447
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,840
is indeed the handwriting
of shopkeeper Zhong.

448
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,720
But we really
couldn't find the bracelet.

449
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,520
Now, the shopkeeper is not in the store.

450
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,920
As for how to pay up,

451
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,920
I'm really sorry

452
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,960
but we still have to wait
for the shopkeeper to come back.

453
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,600
When will he come back?

454
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,080
It's hard to say.

455
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,800
This is personal for the shopkeeper.

456
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,600
We're not really sure.

457
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,320
Personal?

458
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,600
I heard that you shopkeeper

459
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,000
has been playing tricks recently.

460
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,800
In my opinion,

461
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,240
he plotted to run away with our stuff.

462
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,120
Is he running away?

463
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,320
Don't worry about that.

464
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,640
Zhong's pawnshop

465
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,080
has been established
for more than 20 years.

466
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,480
Our reputation is well-known.

467
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,000
If you can't return my bracelet today,

468
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,920
you have to pay me money.

469
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,640
I have told you.

470
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,080
Compensate us.

471
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,720
Since the shopkeeper is away,

472
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,000
the period

473
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,440
is invalid

474
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,440
and will be postponed.

475
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,440
Until their shopkeeper comes back,

476
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,080
if they can't give your bracelet back,

477
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,360
or

478
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,280
he'll not have come back for a long time,

479
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,160
at that time,

480
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,520
you can come here again.

481
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,600
I will handle it impartially.

Well...

483
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,400
Now that Magistrate has said so,

484
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,360
what else can I say?

485
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,600
In three days,

486
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,520
if you can't find the bracelet,

487
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,560
I'll see you in court.

488
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,600
See you in court.

489
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,960
Thank you, Magistrate.

490
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,400
Come on now, mind your own business.

491
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,280
Walk away.

492
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,920
It is early in the morning,

493
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,880
but we have so many troubles.

494
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,160
Where did you two go?

495
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,160
A tavern in the east of the city.

496
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,160
Someone said there was trouble.

497
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,200
The shopkeeper came to report.

498
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,360
We both went to check that out.

499
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,440
Something serious?

500
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,600
It's no big deal.

501
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,760
They were drunk,

502
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,520
torn several tavern signs,

503
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,680
and smashed some chairs.

504
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,800
That shopkeeper is also unreasonable.

505
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,640
Some chairs were knocked over.

506
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,800
He insisted we two should compensate

507
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,160
saying that we were
incompetent in our duties.

508
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,920
Lucky for him, I am on duty.

509
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,200
Otherwise, I would beat him to death.

510
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,880
Magistrate.

511
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,400
Magistrate, someone came to report.

512
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,160
It's a homicide.

513
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,400
Poor child.

514
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,560
Last night,

515
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,560
after I found him,

516
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,360
he was too scared to say a word.

517
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,680
It took him all night

518
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,920
to speak.

519
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,840
When you found him,

520
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,360
was he in the watchtower
in the north of the city?

521
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,320
Yes.

522
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,960
Near the swamp.

523
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,680
Yesterday,

524
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,360
we were playing hide and seek

525
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,480
near the watchtower swamp.

526
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,040
After a long time,

527
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,400
I came out from behind the reeds.

528
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,640
But I couldn't find them.

529
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,680
They couldn't find me either.

530
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,960
I just kept walking.

531
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,520
I wanted to find my way out.

532
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,680
I kept walking

533
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,240
until I approached the swamp.

534
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,800
And then I saw someone lying there.

535
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,000
I saw a zombie.

536
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,400
This place is like hell.

537
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,760
Magistrate.

538
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,160
There is a pool of blood here.

539
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,640
More here.

540
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,960
The man must have been killed here.

541
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,640
And then began to crawl.

542
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,520
Crawl.

543
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,640
To where?

544
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,880
The watchtower.

545
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,640
You guys

546
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:37,960
check around.

547
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,480
[Ying'er]
Human.

548
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,000
I am Di Renjie, Penglai's magistrate.

549
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,400
Lady.

550
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,800
I meant no harm.

551
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,080
I just came by for a routine inquiry.

552
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,720
Last evening,

553
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,040
where were you?

554
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,240
What were you doing?

555
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,600
You are not allowed to be here.

556
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,230
Go away.

557
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:03,600
Lady.

558
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,360
Go.

559
00:36:59,080 --> 00:36:59,760
I've seen it all around.

560
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,800
Didn't see a body.

561
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,680
Who are you guys?

562
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,840
I am Di Renjie, Penglai's magistrate.

563
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,160
We are ordered to patrol here.

564
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,480
There are often
Baekje's spy in this area

565
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,800
as well as smugglers.

566
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,440
Have you ever

567
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,040
found a body here?

568
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,520
Why should I tell you?

569
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,320
How dare you?

570
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,560
I am Penglai's magistrate.

571
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,080
All the cases that happen here

572
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,440
are under my jurisdiction.

573
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,320
We carried it away.

574
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,680
To where?

575
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,240
Barracks.

576
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,200
Where did you find the body?

577
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,640
Right here.

578
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,200
Why didn't you report it to me?

579
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,600
Why did you move the body?

580
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,640
Captain Li asked us
to carry it back.

581
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,000
Who gives him the right to do so?

582
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,040
Magistrate.

583
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,000
As for this,

584
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,560
you'll have to ask Captain Li himself.

585
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,240
Take me to him.

586
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,240
Magistrate.

587
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,400
What did you just find in the watchtower?

588
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,560
Why did he go to the watchtower?

589
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:22,720
Who?

590
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,400
The victim.

591
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,800
The murderer.

592
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,800
And these men.

593
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,440
This is the barracks.

594
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,160
You are allowed in without permission.

595
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,160
This is Penglai's magistrate.

596
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,720
You need to register your name
in the book.

597
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:04,180
[Di]

598
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,420
[Di Renjie, Ma Rong]

599
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:29,660
[Qiao Tai]

600
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,200
Thirteen.

601
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,680
Fourteen.

602
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,360
Fifteen.

603
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,160
Sixteen.

604
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,120
Seventeen.

605
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,040
Eighteen.

606
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,760
Nineteen.

607
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:52,920
Magistrate.

608
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,720
You don't have to do it personally.

609
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,480
It's my duty.

610
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,360
Here is my advice.

611
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,960
Don't come to such
a dangerous place alone.

612
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,240
Your men kept my men

613
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,120
outside the door.

614
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,600
In the barracks,

615
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,360
we don't welcome too many outsiders.

616
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,800
What about the woman on the watchtower?

617
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,040
[Captain Li]
As far as I know,

618
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,120
for a place
under the jurisdiction of barracks,

619
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,280
common people are forbidden.

620
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,800
Her name is Ying'er.

621
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,600
You've met her?

622
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,000
Ying'er is a mad.

623
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,920
She hasn't got into any trouble.

624
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,480
So I let her stay there.

625
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,560
I want to know

626
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,120
why you moved the body without permission?

627
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,000
What I want to know more is

628
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,800
why

629
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,000
the barracks meddle in this matter?

630
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,120
Thewatchtower area is
under the jurisdiction of the barracks.

631
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,720
I am the Penglai's magistrate.

632
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,960
In Penglai, I'm responsible

633
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,560
for any case, big or small.

634
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,480
If there is a murder involved,

635
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,200
you should report to me in time.

636
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,040
When I have disposed of the body,

637
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,920
I will ask someone
to send you a message.

638
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,320
You disposed of the body?

639
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,520
In such weather,

640
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,080
I can't leave a body here.

641
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,440
I don't want my soldiers

642
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,920
to die of plague.

643
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,040
It's probably burned out by now.

644
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,440
Where is the body?

645
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,400
Take me there.

646
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,000
It's OK.

647
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:17,920
Let him go.

648
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:27,880
Magistrate.

649
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,480
Be careful.

650
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,400
Don't get yourself burnt.

651
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,400
So many rules.

652
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,440
Why aren't we allowed
to go in with Magistrate?

653
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,440
You don't understand this.

654
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,280
Inside the barracks,

655
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,160
there are countless rules.

656
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,280
When I was a soldier,

657
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,160
I suffered a lot from rules.

658
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,040
So sometimes if you don't understand,

659
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,040
just remain silent.

660
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,000
What are you doing?

661
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,280
Now that I have nothing to do,

662
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,440
I want to have some practice.

663
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,200
Aren't you curious about it?

664
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,400
This shabby chest is locked up.

665
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,400
What's in it?

666
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,180
[Erotic pictures]

667
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,680
Look at how stressful
these young soldiers are.

668
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,760
No wonder it's locked.

669
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,240
Have you done the same thing?

670
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,240
Am I that kind of guy?

671
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,120
OK.

672
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,080
Let them go back.

673
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:56,920
Easy, easy.

674
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,640
Slowly.

675
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,440
Slowly.

676
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,200
Awesome.

677
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,600
Are you all right, brothers?

678
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,400
Fine.

679
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,000
Fine.

680
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:14,960
It's worth it.

681
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,920
Last night was awesome.

682
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:17,960
Is it worth

683
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:18,840
getting beaten up?

684
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:19,800
Hell yes.

685
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:23,560
OK.
