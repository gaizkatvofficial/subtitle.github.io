Wild geese are rarely seen.

What's described in the seasonal song

8
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,760
is right.

Magistrate,

10
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,480
why do you suddenly want
to hunt wild geese?

11
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,960
You didn't have such a habit.

12
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,240
I just need a wild goose.

13
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,680
But it's been three days.

14
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,720
We didn't even see a goose egg.

15
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,080
It's not tasty.

16
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,680
The wild goose meat tastes awful.

17
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,000
The meat is tough
and difficult to swallow.

18
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,440
In this season, we should eat deer.

infiltrated all the gangs.

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,040
or gather.

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,840

It's not easy to have a clue.

180
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,840
Chen Xiaoyun?

181
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,280
First,

182
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,800
we don't know whether his words

183
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,520
are true or not.

184
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,000
Second,

185
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,320
Heiyan and we

186
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,160
go way back.

187
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,040
They never let us get

188
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,720
such a clear clue.

189
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,560
Heiyan can't

contact him only.

00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,680
We should continue to investigate.

193
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,280
Solving cases

194
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,600
doesn't mean taking risks.

195
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,680
Taking such a risk

196
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,400
is not bravery,

197
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,080
but stupidity.

198
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,600
I...

199
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,120
Stop here.

200
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,760
Don't mention it

201
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,520
again.

202
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,840
Why didn't you say something?

203
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,680
Wasn't the clue provided by you?

204
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,520
When can you stop being stupid?

205
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,800
I'll get the wild goose ready.

206
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,080
Yeah, good for you.

207
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,960
You are busy?

208
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,600
You are back.

209
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,440
These are what you bought on the street?

210
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,120
The white bag contains
what I bought for you.

211
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
Gloves?

212
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,720
In autumn,

213
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,440
winds are rampant in Lanfang County.

214
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,200
When you hunt wild geese,

215
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,680
you use a bow,

216
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,920
and your hands are exposed.

217
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,800
I'm afraid they will get cold.

218
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,040
You'll need the gloves.

219
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,120
How do you know

220
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,800
I went to hunt wild geese?

221
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,920
There is sand on your clothes

222
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,800
and you have goose feathers
on the soles of your shoes.

223
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,840
I've been with you for so long,

224
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,280
so I've been influenced.

225
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,040
I've learned something.

226
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,840
I told Hong Liang

227
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,360
not to tell you.

228
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,320
Is hunting wild geese a taboo?

229
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,800
Why can't you tell me?

230
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,120
I just wanted to wait

231
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,040
until everything worked out

232
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,280
before I told you.

233
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,720
"Work" means to enhance.

234
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,040
"Out" indicates reality.

235
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,080
"To work out"

236
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,160
is to enhance reality.

237
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,080
I'm already very satisfied
with the reality.

238
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,200
After all,

239
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,040
no one can predict the future.

240
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,880
Just seize the moment.

241
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,720
Well,

242
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,800
how long do you plan to squat there?

243
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,320
Can you do something productive?

244
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,520
Is there anything productive to do?

245
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,200
Is there anyone

246
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,440
doing anything productive in this house?

247
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,840
My biggest business now

248
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,800
is to accompany this Miss Cao
who is of unknown origin

249
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,840
to stroll around every day.

250
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,040
Is the Magistrate
doing anything productive?

251
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,640
His biggest business

252
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,680
is to chat with her
in the room all day long.

253
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,640
What are you talking about?

254
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,480
All these years, Miss Cao

255
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,040
has never troubled you with anything.

256
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,600
You won't even do her a little favor?

257
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,920
If you are unwilling to go,

258
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,880
I'll go next time.

259
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,560
Did she cast a spell on you?

260
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,040
First, Magistrate Di.

261
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,960
Then, Mr. Hong.

262
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,200
Now it's you, right?

263
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,040
What spell?

264
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,920
You mustn't make baseless accusations.

265
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,120
After Miss Cao came,

266
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,880
aren't the Magistrate's files in order?

267
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,360
Isn't he smiling more than he used to?

268
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,840
What's so great about arranging files?

269
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,800
If I were literate, I could also do it.

270
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,200
If you didn't brag,
you could have been literate long ago.

271
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,400
Don't look down upon me!

272
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,240
Bragging all day long.

273
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,160
What can you do but brag?

274
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,880
Is Chen Xiaoyun

275
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,160
locked in the back?

276
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,680
What do you want to do?

277
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,040
This...

278
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,480
Isn't this... during the day...

279
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,000
What?

280
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,320
It's dead.

281
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,840
Should I just put it in the Archive?

282
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,720
Waiting for it to stink?

283
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,040
Fine.

284
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,840
Just do it.

285
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,800
This is from Heiyan.

286
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,120
Don't get poisoned to death.

287
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,200
From Heiyan, so what?

288
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,280
Poison?

289
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,080
The one to poison me is not born yet.

290
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,440
Chen Xiaoyun, is it around?

291
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,000
Yes, right ahead.

292
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,760
Tai?

293
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,760
You are so bold.

294
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,720
You took the criminal out
without permission.

295
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,120
Let's go.

296
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,440
Go.

297
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,800
If the Magistrate knew
you were acting on your own,

298
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,400
he would punish you.

299
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,760
If we don't investigate
following such a good clue,

300
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,960
we will have to go catch them
after they run away.

301
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,660
The Magistrate is becoming

302
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,000
more and more timid.

303
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,080
How far is it?

304
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,240
Right ahead.

305
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,800
In less than half an hour,

306
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,640
we will arrive.

307
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,600
Behave yourself.

308
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,400
Rong!

309
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,840
Watch out!

310
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,600
Everyone disperse!

311
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,240
Chen Xiaoyun, don't run!

312
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,920
Rong,

313
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,880
don't chase him!

314
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,800
Chen Xiaoyun?

315
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,640
Miss Ma.

316
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,400
Miss Ma,

317
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,200
Mr. Qiao got hit by an arrow.

318
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,160
His wound is not serious.

319
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,440
But I suspect

320
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,600
he has more than just an injury.

321
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,360
He might be

322
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,160
poisoned.

323
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:23,680
Well,

324
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,360
what kind of poison is in him?

325
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,800
Is there a way to detoxify it?

326
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,480
I've never seen

327
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,920
this kind of poison.

328
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,320
Logically,

329
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,600
any poison attack

330
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,720
would have an abnormal reaction.

331
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,800
But he

332
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,720
doesn't look any different

333
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,800
and seems to be asleep.

334
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,280
- His face is ruddy and serene.
- Charlatan.

335
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:39,960
Charlatan.

336
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,880
Why talk so much nonsense?

337
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:42,760
Hong.

338
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,840
You must save him today!

339
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,680
Okay.

340
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,880
Let go of me!

341
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,480
Enough!

342
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,480
Leave this place to me.

343
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:01,870
Coroner Hu

344
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,200
may have discovered something.

345
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,680
Go take a look.

346
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,400
I see.

347
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,960
What do you know?

348
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,760
You saw

349
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,000
the Fairy of Ninth Heaven.

350
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,520
You saw Qilin.

351
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,240
You also saw...

352
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,680
What did he see?

353
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,360
Dreams are good.

354
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,360
They can make people
forget their worries.

355
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,720
You fell asleep.

356
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,040
You are dreaming.

357
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,040
Obviously, he is as dead as a doornail.

358
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,680
You told me he had just fallen asleep

359
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,240
and had been dreaming.

360
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,160
When did I say he had fallen asleep?

361
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,400
I'm talking about Qiao Tai.

362
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,120
Qiao Tai is okay.

363
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,600
He will wake up himself.

364
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,720
You...

365
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,160
He is like this.

366
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,360
You think I don't know
if he is as dead as a doornail?

367
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,440
Lunatic.

368
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,400
Who?

369
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,280
What happened?

370
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,400
Magistrate,

371
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,400
there was a dark shadow
on the roof just now.

372
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,360
Nightmare for a day.

373
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,080
Wake up in three days.

374
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,600
Boqi devours dreams.

375
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,560
Explain the dreams in Qingchuan.

376
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,240
He is

377
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,040
in Qingchuan.

378
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,360
[Qingchuan]

379
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,200
Qingchuan's location is special.

380
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,760
It is at the junction
of Shannan Circuit,

381
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,680

is even more complicated.

what situation you'll face
if you go there.

387
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,600
Besides,

388
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,200
Qiao Tai is suffering
from a strange poison.

389
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,360
He deliberately

390
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,160
poisoned Qiao Tai.

391
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,880
Wake up in three days.

392
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,440
Qiao Tai is okay.

393
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,720
He will wake up himself.

394
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,320
Qiao Tai

395
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,760
is okay.

396
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,440
He will wake up in three days.

397
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,000
But if I want to read the dream,

398
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,080
I have to

399
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,600
go to Qingchuan.

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,280
Did it ever occur to you

403
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,720
that this was a trap?

404
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,360
Try what you have devised.

405

Even though I know it's a trap,

406
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,520
won't I

407
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,640
jump in?

00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,160
You are just going there

00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,360
to pry.

412
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,600
Even if you find something,

413
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,120
you can't act on your own.

414

If you don't want Ma Rong
to go with you,

415

00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,840
I promise you.

Make or break,

419
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,040
I will come back

Thank you, Miss Cao.

if you still keep calling me Miss Cao,

437
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,920
I won't respond.

00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,080
Why?

474
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,280
What kind of elixir

475
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,960
is in your gourd?

476

477
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,160
why you said "also".

478
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,000

00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,520
If it's not empty,

484
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,680
I can't put anything in.

has infiltrated Qingchuan.

539
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,760
I haven't heard of it for quite some time.

Yes.

those two people

544
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,640
were killed by Heiyan?

545
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,760
It's still unclear.

I happened to encounter the two of them.

548
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,880
I have to perform an autopsy

549
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,040
to see whether they were killed
by Heiyan.

550
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,560
An autopsy is unnecessary.

551
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,760
Their bodies have been buried.

552
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,720
Buried?

553
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,800

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,240
don't make it so complicated.

557
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,200
Just two bandits died.

558
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,400
Does it matter who killed them?

559
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,600

560
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,160
there are indeed rumors in town

561

that something big is about to happen.

The mastermind

563
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,520
can't be Heiyan you mentioned,

564
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,240
can it?

565
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,280
You have a permanent presence here.

566
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,560
You know Qingchuan

00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,160
If Heiyan does make trouble,

569
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,720
can you please send troops

570
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,840
to suppress it?

571
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,920
You must be joking.

If we are to encounter

575
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,560
a force as powerful as Heiyan,

576
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,080
our people are too few.

577
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,440
Commander Xiao,

578
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,600
please don't hesitate.

579
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,960
Please report

580
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,680
to the military office immediately

581
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,480
and ask for reinforcements.

582
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,190
That's not necessary.

583
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,000
After all, nothing serious

584
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,480
has happened in Qingchuan.

585
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,960
Just rumors.

586
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,560
Let's wait and see.

587
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,560
Commander Xiao,

588
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,440
in broad daylight,

589
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,640
a few strangers died on the street.

590
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,230
Is this just gonna go away?

591
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,480
Magistrate Di,

592
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,920
you are the Magistrate
of Lanfang County.

593
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,440
I am the intermediate military officer
of Qingchuan.

594
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,080
I don't need you

595
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,080
to teach me what to do.

596
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:33,670
Don't take it

597
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:36,480
personally.

598
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,040
Magistrate Di,

599
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,200
is there anything else

600
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:42,960
I can do

601
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,800
for you?

602
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,560
Please issue

603
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,560
an identity certificate

604
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,640
for me.

605
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,160
The name is

606
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,400
Lin Muzhi.

607
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,600
From Ganzhou.

608
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,120
The occupation

609
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:01,840
is a healer.

610
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,240
Who is that man who was shouting

611
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,760
for money in the street just now?

612
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,520
He is

613
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,160
called Wei Sheng.

614
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,560
He is the boss of Green Bird Inn.

615
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,640
Wei Sheng.

616
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,880
Wei Sheng is a miser.

617
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,920
Half a month ago,

618
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,920
his wife ran away
with a guest in the inn.

619
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,080
He curses her loudly every day,

620
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,400
saying she is faithless.

621
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,360
Wei Sheng is not a decent guy, either.

622
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,520
I think

623
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,000
it makes sense his wife

624
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,240
ran off with someone else.

625
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,040
He has a daughter named Wei.

626
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,840
She is really pitiful.

627
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,520
Thank you.

628
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,700
[Wei]

629
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,960
Thank you for today.

630
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:07,920
Are you staying?

631
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,000
Yes.

632
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,320
Follow me.

633
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,320
Boss,

634
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,000
chalk it up to me.

635
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:18,560
Let's go.

636
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,200
Boss.

637
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,240
Boss.

638
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:40,020
[Wei Sheng]

639
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,160
Are you staying?

640
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:43,880
How long will you stay?

641
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,040
As long

642
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,960
as it is necessary.

643
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,880
Your identity certificate, please.

644
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,160
Healer?

645
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,240
Come on.

646
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,200
Brat,

647
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,760
take the guest to his room.

648
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,440
Follow me.

649
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,240
You don't look

650
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,040
like his daughter.

651
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,800
I'm not.

652
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,400
I'm a handyman.

653
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,040
I do the cleaning, cook,

654
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,400
clean the rooms,

655
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,640
and everything else.

656
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,520
Isn't he your father?

657
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,000
Foster father.

658
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,960
He seems to have a load on his mind.

659
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,040
He has no heart.

660
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,600
You...

661
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,200
You have too many questions.

662
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,880
Is there

663
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,360
a bathhouse in this place?

664
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,320
Do you want to take a bath?

665
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,000
I've traveled a long way

666
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,040
and I'm travel-stained.

667
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,680
I have to take a bath anyway.

668
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,400
You rich people are so picky.

669
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,120
Do I look

670
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,800
like a rich man?

671
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,000
I am

672
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,840
a healer.

673
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,400
I don't care what you do.

674
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,720
The bathhouse is downstairs.

675
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,240
Also,

676
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,680
don't let other people
know you are rich.

677
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:32,920
In Qingchuan,

678
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,160
don't show your wealth.

679
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,200
There are people inside.

680
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,360
A private bathhouse?

681
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,400
Get lost!

682
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,600
Can't you hear me?

683
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,800
Get lost!

684
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,400
Don't be rude.

685
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,000
Let him come in.

686
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,060
[Miss Shiyi]

687
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:11,920
Please.

688
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,600
The home guard

689
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,640
should be disciplined.

690
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,800
Sorry for the rudeness.

691
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,440
It doesn't matter.

692
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:30,840
Sir,

693
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,840
what's your name?
