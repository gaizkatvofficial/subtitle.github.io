I said they shouldn't have gone there.

192
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,580
The north of the mountains
and the south of the water are Yin.

193
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,220
How else would they have encountered

194
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,820
such a once-in-a-century snowstorm?

195
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,820
Man proposes, but Heaven disposes.

196
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,500
Fine, Mr. Hong.

197
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,620
Stop nagging.

198
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,060
The Magistrate and Miss Cao will be fine.

199
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:02,940
Let's go.

200
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,820
Don't forget to take this.

201
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,740
Mount the horse.

202
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,220
Be careful on the road.

203
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,180
Okay!

204
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,860
How is he?

205
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,220
The Magistrate's pulse

206
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,540
is disordered.

207
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,300
He was not just poisoned.

208
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,300
He may also have

209
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,020
excessive internal heat

210
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,460
and has fallen ill from overwork.

211
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:28,700
It doesn't matter.

212
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,420
I'll get him some herbs.

213
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,740
Thank you.

214
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:37,780
Huaiying.

215
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,020
Magistrate,

216
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,060
you are awake.

217
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,020
This is...?

218
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,140
I am Li Miao.

219
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,780
This place is Zhao Yun Library.

220
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,660
Our teacher is Cui Haoran, Mr. Cui.

221
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,500
I've heard

222
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,860
Mr. Cui's song in Dingdu.

223
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,780
Mr. Cui

224
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,300
is kind to others

225
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,580
and makes no social distinctions
in teaching.

226
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,020
He is a great scholar.

227
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:19,980
Yes.

228
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,380
We came rashly...

229
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,700
Help me get up.

230
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,020
I'll go to greet Mr. Cui.

231
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,660
Well...

232
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,420
Mr. Cui is now in retreat.

233
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:33,940
Yes.

234
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,140
Besides,

235
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,940
Magistrate, your health...

236
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,620
I'm fine.

237
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,300
We came rashly.

238
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,180
Help me get up.

239
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,020
This way.

240
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:00,900
Magistrate,

241
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,820
the roads in the library are intricate.

242
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,330
On this snowy night,

243
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,020
the view is even more obstructed.

244
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,020
If you need anything,

245
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,300
Miss Cao can ask the students
in the library to do it.

246
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,780
Don't walk around on your own.

247
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,340
Come.

248
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,540
Be careful.

249
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,700
Why is he burning sandalwood
with such a strong smell?

250
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,020
In order to write smoothly

251
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,620
and understand the historical facts,

252
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,340
every time after reading
historical materials,

253
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,220
our teacher will be in retreat

254
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,340
and focus on meditation.

255
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,580
So he should be burning the sandalwood

256
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,980
to calm his mind.

257
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,260
Our teacher

258
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,660
repeatedly told us

259
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,500
not to disturb him during his retreat.

260
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,140
Otherwise, his previous efforts
would be wasted.

261
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:16,900
This is...?

262
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,620
Eaglewood from Yunshui Lodge.

263
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,860
Please give this

264
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,380
to Mr. Cui.

265
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,420
I won't disturb him.

266
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,420
Magistrate.

267
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,420
Well,

268
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,700
now that you are here,

269
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,820
just go in.

270
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,300
I thank you for my teacher.

271
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,700
I'll take this inside for him.

272
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,100
Are you okay?

273
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,700
Magistrate, be careful.

274
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,220
Who is it?

275
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,300
Mr. Li.

276
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,780
Zhou Li?

277
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,900
Where are you going?

278
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,060
The firewood in Mr. Cui's room
is not burning well.

279
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:05,860
I

280
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,300
will fetch some firewood.

281
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,340
Fetch some firewood.

282
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,180
I've told you so many times

283
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,140
that the woodshed is over there.

284
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,980
It's not in this direction.

285
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,860
I see.

286
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,460
Over there.

287
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,420
Not in this direction.

288
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,700
Not in this direction.

289
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,060
Over there.

290
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,660
Please don't take it ill.

291
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,380
He is called Zhou Li.

292
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,900
He is a new student here.

293
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,500
Although the roads in the library
are intricate,

294
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,180
after such a long time,

295
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,580
he just can't remember

296
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,340
where the woodshed is.

297
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,220
I also feel...

298
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,980
Come on, hurry.

299
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,300
Hurry back to the room.

300
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:53,980
Miss Cao,

301
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,940
please let the Magistrate have a rest now.

302
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,060
I'll decoct the medicine for him.

303
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,100
I'll go with you.

304
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,420
Please wait for me
at the door for a while.

305
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,300
Have a rest.

306
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,060
I'll go get you some medicine.

307
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:20,900
Huaiying.

308
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:24,900
Magistrate.

309
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,020
What's wrong with the Magistrate?

310
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,260
Huaiying.

311
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:30,980
I saw...

312
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,340
I saw a child in white

313
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,220
going that way.

314
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:37,580
Well...

315
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,660
Come on. Go inside the room first.

316
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:41,580
Come.

317
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:42,820
Slowly.

318
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,340
Let me take the medicine.

319
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,900
The Magistrate said

320
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,580
he had seen a child in white in the yard.

321
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,220
No way.

322
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,660
Our library does not teach children.

323
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,820
A year ago, when our teacher
started to retreat,

324
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,940
he left only his close disciples
in the library.

325
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:32,700
Moreover,

326
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,980
they are all adults.

327
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,180
You have a fever.

328
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,660
So you could be hallucinating.

329
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,380
No.

330
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,780
I wasn't hallucinating.

331
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,420
I saw the child.

332
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,020
Okay.

333
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,220
Such being the case,

334
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,380
I'll ask them

335
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,900
to look around the yard

336
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,740
and see if any neighboring rascals
have strayed into this place.

337
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,140
If you need,

338
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,860
I can look around the place with you.

339
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:02,980
Miss Cao,

340
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,140
all the people in the library are men.

341
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,380
Please don't

342
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,660
walk around casually.

343
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,500
You don't believe me, either?

344
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,460
I do.

345
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,580
Don't think too much.

346
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,580
If there is really a child,

347
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,060
they will find them.

348
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,860
Mr. Li said

349
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,540
this medicine could work wonders.

350
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,140
If tomorrow,

351
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,620
the weather is better,

352
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,140
we will set off immediately.

353
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,180
Tai,

354
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,220
there isn't even a soul around here.

355
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,700
How can we find them?

356
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,580
Just go all the way south.

357
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,780
Can you still tell the directions?

358
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,660
I couldn't be a soldier for nothing.

359
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:18,660
Let's go.

360
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:28,460
[Zhao Yun Library]

361
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:33,660
[Gate to True Learning]

362
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,780
Zhou Li.

363
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,020
Come down.

364
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,780
Come down.

365
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,300
Come down.

366
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,220
Come here.

367
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,740
You evil spirits.

368
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,860
Come here. I'm not afraid of you!

369
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,540
Come down, Zhou Li.

370
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,500
Zhou Li.

371
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,700
It's too dangerous.

372
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,820
Come down.

373
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,820
It's too dangerous.

374
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,220
Come down. It's too dangerous up there.

375
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:23,740
Come.

376
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,300
Come.

377
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,180
It's too dangerous up there.

378
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,660
Come down.

379
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,980
Zhou Li, did you hear us?

380
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,060
Come down.

381
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,740
Yama.

382
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,260
Evil spirits.

383
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,260
Come down.

384
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,860
You all come!

385
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,420
Zhou Li, come down.

386
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,180
It's dangerous.

387
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,060
Zhou Li.

388
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,780
It's too dangerous up there.

389
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,860
Zhou Li, it's dangerous up there.

390
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,860
It's too dangerous.

391
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,140
It's too dangerous up there. Come down.

392
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,460
Come down, Zhou Li.

393
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,940
Did you hear us?

394
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:54,700
Come down.

395
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,500
Zhou Li.

396
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,020
Zhou Li.

397
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,060
Zhou Li, come down.

398
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,820
Zhou Li, come down.

399
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,420
It's too dangerous.

400
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,580
Come down.

401
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,540
It's too dangerous.

402
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,460
Zhou Li.

403
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,220
Come!

404
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,020
This...

405
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,660
Come, Huaiying.

406
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:44,220
[Ghost]

407
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,860
Mr. Li.

408
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,300
Lin Shu.

409
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:57,940
[Lin Shu]
Why

410
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,780
did Zhou Li do this?

411
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,580
When I woke up,

412
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,140
Zhou Li was not in bed.

413
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,620
I went out to see

414
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,580
and found him on the rooftop.

415
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,580
He was dancing wildly.

416
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,460
I don't know why he was like that.

417
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,020
Mr. Li.

418
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,300
Miss Cao.

419
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,740
Look at his palm.

420
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,300
[Ghost]
It seems to be the word "ghost".

421
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,100
I saw him writing it on his palm

422
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,940
before he jumped down.

423
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,420
Could you

424
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,020
take me to Zhou Li's room?

425
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,060
Okay.

426
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:41,500
Lin Shu,

427
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,460
lead the way.

428
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,820
Miss, please.

429
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,060
Such a tragedy.

430
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,020
Miss, please.

431
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,900
[Gate to True Learning]

432
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,620
This way, please.

433
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,220
Here is his room.

434
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:09,900
Miss Cao,

435
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:10,900
our teacher

436
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,460
repeatedly gave us
the following instructions.

437
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,460
Lead a simple life

438
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,380
and enjoy living in a shabby house.

439
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:19,580
Miss Cao,

440
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,340
this is Zhou Li's desk.

441
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,620
Where was Zhou Li from?

442
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,620
When did he come to the library?

443
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,060
His family lives in a nearby village.

444
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,940
His mother is his only parent left. 
His elder sister is looking after her.

445
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,180
He had been in the library

446
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,860
for over ten months.

447
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,580
After Mr. Cui retreated?

448
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,300
Yes.

449
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,580
I actually have no right to take him in.

450
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,700
But I thought he was sincere in his study.

451
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,100
Besides, he kept begging me,

452
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,020
so I could only bend the rules

453
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,180
and let him join the library.

454
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,740
He could pay his tuition by doing chores.

455
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,660
This is...

456
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,180
Lin Shu,

457
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,660
Zhou Li's condition was so serious.

458
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,180
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

459
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,420
Zhou Li had been out of his mind
for a long time?

460
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,340
He...

461
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,500
He had been

462
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,620
acting weird lately.

463
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,340
He always said

464
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,900
he was agitated.

465
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,820
He also said someone was watching him.

466
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,820
He often rambled at night.

467
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,220
Miss Cao, I don't want to say
anything improper

468
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,220
to cause concern,

469
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,660
but Zhou Li

470
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,140
was indeed quite weird lately.

471
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,260
During the morning reading,
he was often absent-minded.

472
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,100
I scolded him.

473
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,940
He told me

474
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,180
he had a Heavenly Eye.

475
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,020
He said he could see

476
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,500
unexpected calamities, wronged souls,

477
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,540
anxiety-ridden people,

478
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,820
and spirits behind people's backs.

479
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,420
I thought

480
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,100
he had read too much light reading.

481
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,290
I didn't expect him...

482
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,340
Miss Cao,

483
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,770
can you believe what he said?

484
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:25,020
After the Magistrate wakes up,

485
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,210
I'll tell him everything.

486
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,290
He will examine the body.

487
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,290
At that time,

488
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:31,580
there will be a definitive conclusion.

489
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,180
Okay.

490
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,100
Okay.

491
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:38,860
Miss Cao,

492
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,180
I'll walk you back to your room.

493
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:42,500
Lin Shu,

494
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,340
put Zhou Li's body

495
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,660
in the woodshed for now.

496
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:46,460
Yes.

497
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,100
Miss Cao, please.

498
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,620
Tai,

499
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,420
I think it's weird.

500
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,620
It's like we're going around in circles.

501
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,220
Impossible.

502
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,300
With my sense of direction,

503
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,660
it should be...

504
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,260
Tai!

505
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,660
We are really going around in circles.

506
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,180
Mr. Hong is right.

507
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,980
The north of the mountains
and the south of the water are Yin.

508
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,620
We've encountered a ghost.

509
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,180
Don't talk nonsense.

510
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,700
How can there be a ghost?

511
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,420
That way. Follow me.
