Yesterday,

we caught a dealer purchasing loot.

212
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,920
According to him,

213
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,600
the thief and the loot

214
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,270
are in this inn.

215
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,390
Who sold you the pearl?

216
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,390
Officer,

217
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,480
I've told you everything.

218
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,110
I only agreed to trade here
at noon today,

219
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,200
but I don't know

220
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,790
who I'm dealing with.

221
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,920
Officer, he's lying.

222
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,230
How could this
possibly happen in our inn?

223
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,670
Bring me the register.

224
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,110
Okay...

We don't do that kind of thing.

Officer.

You don't even write the date.
It's a scribble.

228
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:02,830
How can I read it?

229
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,950
No, Officer.

230
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,040
It's a small inn.

231
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,200
We don't have enough staff

232
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,270

233
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,350
I beg your pardon.

234

Nothing to do with us.

You can't frame good people.

Right.

240
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,350
Shut up.

241
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,840
Since no one admits it,

242
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,550
we'll take everyone back.

tomorrow is the imperial examination.

248
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,880
You can't just arrest anyone you see.

249
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,520
Right.

250
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,790
We're here to take the examination.

251
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,030
We have to take the examination tomorrow.

252
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,880
How can we still take it?

253
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:34,520
That's right.

254
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,440
Stop! Who is there?

00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:41,790
Catch him.

Quite skillful.

What?

00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,550
You stole and want to run away?

259
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,550
I didn't steal anything.

261
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,320

Take this thief back.

263
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,520
Stop.

264
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,230
It's not him.

265
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,670
How do you know?

266
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,550
He's just a deserter.

267
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,880
Desertion is a capital offense.

268
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,840
He's hiding in this inn.

269
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,350
I've never even seen him.

270
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,640
Look at him.

271
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,150
His skin is dark.

272
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,350
His cheeks are red.

273
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,080
This is the typical face of one weathered

00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,240
[Wu Bing]
Wu Bing,

346
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,560
with a kid.

347
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,830
Since they got to Chang'an,

348
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,270
the boy always wanted to go out.

349
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,270
But they're

350
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,480
only focused on preparing for the exam.

351
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,630
These days,

352
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,800
they haven't left the inn.

353
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,360
When can we go out and have fun?

354
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,390
That's right.

355
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:11,710
We've been here for so many days,

356
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:12,950
but we haven't left the inn.

357
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,000
After the examination tomorrow,

358
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,590
I'll take you to the West Market
the day after tomorrow.

359
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,830
Great!

360
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,000
So it's impossible

361
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,950
for them to steal.

362
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:22,950
Liu Hai

363
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:23,800
and Liu Xuantong

364
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,830
are from Longzhou.

365
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,360
Liu Xuantong's been bedridden.

366
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,750
Liu Hai's been with him

367
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,150
and never left the inn.

368
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,360
Yuchi Sinian.

369
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,000
A poor child.

370
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,920
Ever since he came to the inn,

371
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,950
he's been working as a laborer.

372
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,510
And him,

373
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,360
Sun Zizhi.

374
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,320
He's a musician.

375
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,590
Pingkang Ward
is where he works every day.

376
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,480
And the Ashina tribe.

377
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,440
They just want to have a good time
in Chang'an

378
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,560
after the imperial examination.

379
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:42,560
They

380
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,510
don't have time.

381
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,710
Chen Mingjian.

382
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,040
Since he arrived,

383
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,270
he's never left.

384
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,480
I don't think it's him.

385
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,390
Wu Jingkai.

386
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,560
He left the inn once,

387
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,480
but the place he went

388
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,920
was just in front of the inn.

389
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,480
Guo Chuan hasn't left the inn

390
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,560
since he arrived.

391
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,270
Then, it's Zhong Xiaofei.

392
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,270
Zhong Xiaofei?

393
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,270
I don't think it's him.

394
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,630
It's not him...

395
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,000
Who in the inn is most likely

396
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,270
to steal the pearl?

397
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,190
If your register is correct,

398
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:12,800
then it's him.

399
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,510
He looks unfamiliar to me.

400
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,000
He

401
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,390
is not on the register either.

402
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,880
If there's a suspect,

403
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:32,750
it could only be him.

404
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,680
Take him down.

405
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,630
I'm just passing through.

406
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,360
My name's Chen Yaoguang.

407
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:35,590
Take him down.

408
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,390
I'm just a bookkeeper.

409
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,480
My referee is Yan Mao.

410
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,750
He's in Xinchang Ward.

411
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,590
If you don't believe me,
go to him and ask him.

412
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,670
It's not me.

413
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,870
It could be him.

414
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,040
He's not on the register either.

415
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,160
Sir.

416
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,600
Don't joke with me.

417
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,840
I'm the innkeeper.

418
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,110
How can I be on the register?

419
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,750
I've been here for ten years.

420
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,870
You know what I'm talking about.

421
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,190
You may know what people appear to be,

422
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,280
but you don't know their true colors.

423
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,310
Sir, I'm innocent.

424
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,230
Take him down.

425
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:06,670
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

426
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,040
Officer, I'm innocent.

427
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,920
Officer.

428
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,110
Officer, I'm innocent, Officer.

429
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:21,790
We got him.

430
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:22,960
Where's the pearl?

431
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,190
Abacus.

432
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,400
Give it to me.

433
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:27,840
Hand it over.

434
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,990
Officer, I...

435
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,790
It's not in here.

436
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,630
It's not my abacus.

437
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:04,720
It's his.

438
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,870
I told you I'm innocent.

439
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,790
Sir, it's not me.

440
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,040
Sir, what are you doing?

441
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,230
Sir, I really didn't take it.

442
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,190
I really didn't take it.

443
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,480
Look, he's the thief.

444
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,360
This is not mine.

445
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:22,990
He's the thief.

446
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:23,720
This is not mine.

447
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,670
This is not mine.

448
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,790
I said I'm innocent.

449
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,520
I'm innocent.

450
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,080
Wait.

451
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,160
This is not his.

452
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,080
Oh heavens.

453
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,840
Bring some water.

454
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,430
Officer.

455
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,160
Look.

456
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,030
There's

457
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,240
a layer of grease on it.

458
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,360
It's because

459
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,790
the innkeeper used it

460
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,000
during his daily grind.

461
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,240
And that abacus

462
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,080
belonged to the fake bookkeeper.

463
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,030
He switched it.

464
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,640
We've got the thief and the loot.

465
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,720
This is

466
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,880
the truth.

467
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,120
I've been stealing for over ten years,

468
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,910
but I never thought I'd get caught

469
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,910
by you guys in Chang'an.

470
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,360
We've got the thief and the loot.

471
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,600
Take him back.

472
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,150
Yes, Sir.

473
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,080
Get up.

474
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,190
Move it.

475
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:28,880
Quick. Go.

476
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,360
Officer.

477
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,000
Can you spare

478
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,640
that deserter's life?

479
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,600
Thank you, sir.

480
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:25,580
[West Market]

481
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:26,600
Huaiying,

482
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,190
the debt,

483
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,670
the return to the house,

484
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,190
I won't talk about them, okay?

485
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,960
You like to get into trouble outside.

486
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,960
I don't care either.

487
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,390
From now on,
you can do whatever you want.

488
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,390
But one thing.

489
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,190
Tomorrow,

490
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,390
can you go to the examination?

491
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,190
You can do whatever you want
from then on.

492
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:42,790
I...

493
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,240
Look.

494
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:48,790
Huaiying,

495
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,910
Western Regions are a mess.

496
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:51,840
Qiao Tai

497
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:52,880
and Ma Rong,

498
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,910
you don't even know them well.

499
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,150
You brought them back
to Chang'an with you.

500
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,670
Aren't you afraid

501
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,790
of what they'll get you into?

502
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,310
Excuse me.

503
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:01,910
Take a look...

504
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,600
Make way.

505
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,030
Make way.

506
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,480
Stop there.

507
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,270
Make way, please.

508
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:14,960
Stop.

509
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,000
Stop there.

510
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,720
Move aside.

511
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,360
Stop there.

512
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,120
My wine.

513
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,910
Stop.

514
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:25,640
Stop there.

515
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,480
Make way.

516
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,080
This is too dangerous. This...

517
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:34,840
Stop there.

518

The last time I ate this much

661

was when I killed

Back then,

we robbed the rich to aid the poor.

We never killed an innocent person.

you've committed murder and robbery.

691
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,230
this world will never get better.

692
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,340
[Di's Residence]

693
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,750
Di?

694
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,960
You scared me.

695
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,510
Why did you talk
to the neighborhood official?

696
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,150
Did you know Di Renjie's father used

697
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,110
to be a prominent official in Chang'an?

698
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,470
Did you know his family

699
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,080
owns a big house?

700
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,630
That's weird.

701
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,200
Then why does he stay
in that shabby inn?

702
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,630
I don't know either.

703
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,200
He has so many secrets.

704
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,750
Do you think the name Di Renjie

705
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,960
is also a fake?

706
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,840
A name is just a code.

707
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,390
What's real or fake?

708
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,390
Even if he's using a fake name,

709
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,600
maybe he's got a good reason.

710
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,560
Huaiying,

711
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,270
have you heard?

712
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,080
The categories
of this year's imperial examination

713
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,200
offer many choices.

714
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,470
Regardless of your status
and family background,

715
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,510
you can choose any of them.

716
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,800
There are Confucianism and classic texts.

717
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,720
There are also Astronomy and calculations.

718
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,920
An individualized examination.

719
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,040
Everyone can show their talents.

720
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,270
Mr. Wei told you that?

721
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,870
Didn't you promise
to do well in the exam?

722
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:30,470
Will you...

723
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,560
I promised him I would go to the exam.

724
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,080
I didn't promise him

725
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,270
I'd do well in the exam.

726
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,240
This thing is interesting.

727
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:46,720
Huaiying,

728
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,190
why don't you and I make a bet?

729
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,150
If I win,

730
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,390
you'll go to the exam.

731
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,480
If I lose,

732
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,000
you don't have to take the exam.

733
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,670
Two blacks and three whites
are called ''Ta''.

734
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,000
Three blacks and two whites
are called ''Xiao''.

735
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,480
If it's all black,

736
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,390
that's ''Lu''.

737
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:04,360
If it's all white,

738
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,150
that's ''Kai''.

739
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,480
I choose all whites.

740
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,000
Quick.

741
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,430
If you don't choose,

742
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,640
then it's a win for me.

743
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,080
It's such a big deal,

744
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,360
not a joke.

745
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,360
My fate

746
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,760
must be in my own hands.

747
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,790
Huaiying,

748
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,360
I don't know

749
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,360
what your fate is.

750
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,270
But your fate

751
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,430
has something to do with it.

752
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,840
All candidates,

753
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,840
tidy up your clothes

754
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,270
and enter the examination room.

755
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,550
Leave your belongings here.

756
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,310
Your admission ticket.

757
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:09,600
Leave your wineskin, too.

758
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,720
This year's examination system
is even stricter.

759
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,430
You're not allowed to bring

760
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,480
any drinking or eating utensils in.

761
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,790
Leave your wine flask here.

762
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,430
If it's found in the exam room,

763
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,150
you'll be disqualified.

764
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,600
Alright...

765
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,080
Don't put it upside down.

766
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:27,150
It won't spill.

767
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:27,960
Let's get in.

768
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:30,960
Next.

769
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:36,120
Huaiying,

770
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,080
don't tell Mr. Wei

771
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,840
that I carry a wineskin with me.

772
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,640
If he finds out,

773
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:43,120
the consequences will be unthinkable.

774
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:49,910
Look.

775
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,430
His Majesty and Her Majesty.

776
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:53,430
His Majesty.

777
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,360
Her Majesty.

778
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,720
It's truly His Majesty.

779
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:05,030
The examination is over.

780
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,510
All candidates leave.

781
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,390
Huaiying.

782
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,080
Huaiying.

783
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,080
Let's go to drink.

784
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,360
You did well in the exam?

785
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:15,600
Will you go?

786
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,960
If you don't go,
you're looking down on me.

787
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,960
Let's go... Go...

788
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,720
Study hard for decades,

789
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,960
put pen to paper to serve the court
and gain higher status.

790
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,150
It's been three years.

791
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,550
I can finally go out and about again.

792
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,080
Huaiying,

793
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:43,720
come.

794
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,190
Look.

795
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,600
This is the Great Tang.

796
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,550
Even though it's nighttime,

797
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,880
it's fully illuminated

798
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,190
and crowded with people.

799
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,880
It's like

800
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,750
a festive feast every moment.

801
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:57,750
Let's go.

802
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,680
I heard that the Poetry Contest
two days ago

803
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,510
was very exciting.

804
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,950
The singers, dancers, and best poets
from all over the country

805
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,470
came to Chang'an.

806
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,200
There was my favorite,

807
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,310
the top dancer of the Tang,
Ms. Yulan.

808
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,640
And Cao An.

809
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,550
I like her, too.

810
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:16,030
Her singing

811
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,600
is better than that of all
of the 108 wards in Chang'an.

812
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,030
In the end,

813
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,440
it was Teng Kan

814
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,360
from Penglai

815
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,680
who won first place
in the Poetry Contest.

816
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,160
Teng Kan?

817
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,470
I know him.

818
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,030
Isn't he a military officer?

819
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,140
- He's a general,
- Two gentlemen!

820
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,550
but he's a very good poet now.

821
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,790
Even the Empress and His Majesty

822
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,790
are impressed by his poems.

823
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,270
This place is good.

824
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,990
Are you two guests
of Grand Commandant Zhangsun?

825
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,310
We just want to have a drink.

826
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:52,640
A private event is held here.

827
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:53,840
We can't serve you today.

828
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,710
We just want to have a drink.

829
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,510
Then we...

830
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,750
Let's go. Let's drink somewhere else.

831
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,470
Don't pull me.

832
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,600
I'm telling you.

833
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,510
You're nothing.

834
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,680
Huaiying, let me tell you something.

835
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:11,840
When I become a powerful official,

836
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,030
let's book this place, too.

837
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:13,750
Then

838
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,950
I'll ride the best horses

839
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,990
and drink the best wine.

840
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,310
We'll order the best dancers.

841
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,030
I must pass the examination
and receive a Jinshi degree.

842
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,440
Huaiying,

843
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,790
what are you looking at?

844
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:32,470
♪The land nurtures sweet osmanthus♪

845
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,200
♪Distant woods stand tall and strong♪

846
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:36,990
Huaiying.

847
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:41,680
Huaiying,

848
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,030
slow down. What are you looking for?

849
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,440
Gentlemen, do you two
want to listen to some music?

850
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:46,550
Great...

851
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,120
Do you have singers and dancers here?

852
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:48,920
We have both.

853
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,990
Huaiying, what are you looking for?

854
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,080
May I ask what brings
you two gentlemen here?

855
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,400
I'd like

856
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,030
to see the lady who was singing.

857
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,600
No one was singing.

858
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,120
I clearly heard

859
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,880
someone singing a Bingzhou ditty.

860
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,310

the one who was singing just now.

We're the only ones

You must have misheard.

00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,710
But I did

891
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,440
hear someone singing

892
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,950

No one was singing and that's it.

Let's get drunk today.

910

Slow down.

911
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,270
Wine has strong after-effects.

912
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,030
What? You're afraid I'll get drunk?

913
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,950
Isn't that why we drink?

914
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:17,120
I like to have a sip every day,

915
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,160
but I don't dare

916
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,120
in front of Mr. Wei.

917
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,710
So don't tell Mr. Wei

918
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:23,680
about our drinking today.

919
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,950
Is Mr. Wei still so lecturing?

920
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,200
Now, Mr. Wei

921
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,400
has been granted more responsibility.

922
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,790
By order of His Majesty and the Empress,

924
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:42,790
based on the Record of Eminent Families
from the Zhenguan Period.

925
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,230
Great Families?

926
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,400
It contains 245 surnames

927
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,950
and 287 families,

928
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,680
divided into nine classes.

929

All officials above the fifth rank

930
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,990
are included.

931
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,840
The Empress's four families
are listed in the first class.

932
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:57,270
And soldiers.

933
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:58,790
Soldiers are only included

934
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,790
if they're promoted
to the fifth rank or above

935
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:02,080
based on their military merits.

936
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,120
The other clans with no merits

937
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:05,710
are all at the back.

938
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,640

Of course, it will.

942
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,920
For those old nobles,

943
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,080
like Grand Commandant Zhangsun,

944
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,950
he'll have a hard time in the future.

945
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,400
Maybe one day,

946
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,710
something will go wrong.

947
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,470
This wine is really good.

948
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,230
I'll drink more today.

949
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,360
What's the smell?

950
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:45,030
I lift my drink and sing a song,

951
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:47,640
for who knows if life is short or long.

952
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:49,710
Man's life is but the morning dew.

Past days many, future ones few.

954

The melancholy my heart begets

955
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,230
comes from cares I cannot forget.

956
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,230
To alleviate worries,

957
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,780
only drinking will do.

I'd have drunk it all by now.

But I couldn't bring it
to the examination room today,

971
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:04,790
so there's still some wine left.

972
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:06,840
Why is it so light?

973
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,270
It leaked?

974
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:10,120
It's impossible.

975

What?

976
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:14,920
When did it leak?

977
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:17,840
At the Imperial Academy.

978
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,990
It must have been the servants.

Pity about my good wine.

980
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:30,950
It's bitter.

981
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,950
Why is it so bitter?

982
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:34,120
It's bitter.

Just a little longer.

1010

There are Jinwu Guards out there
searching for you.

drink to our hearts' content.

1017

Where are you going?

1018

I just came to apologize.

1021
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:32,030
We agreed

1022
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,750
to leave after a pot of wine.

1023
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,350
My friend,

1024
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:36,550
he's drunk.

1025
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:37,640
Don't blame him.

1026
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,200
It's fine, Sir.

1027
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:41,440
It's not a problem.

1028
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:43,830
There's a secret door, right?

1029
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:46,030
Where does it lead?

1030
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,030
You must be mistaken, Sir.

1031
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:50,400
There's no such a door.

1032
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:51,880
Here's the wine.

1033

00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,480
I think you've had too much to drink.

1035
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:04,200
Your wine is not good enough.

1036
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,550
I'll make you some hangover soup later.

00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,830
There's a fire.

1039
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:39,680
Fire...

00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,160
Huaiying...

1041
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,200
Put out the fire.

1042
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:43,510
Huaiying.

1043
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:53,120
Huaiying...

1044
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,200
Put out the fire.
