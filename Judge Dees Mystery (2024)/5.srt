00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,000
When did you come back?

350
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,190
I've been here the whole time.

351
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,070
That's weird.

352
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,680
I didn't see you just now.

353
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,520
You thought I was in the house.

354
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,310
That's why you kept looking inside.

355
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,680
That's how people are.

356
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,000
Di Renjie,

357
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,920
I'm telling you.

358
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,680
I didn't peep at you.

359
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,000
When did I say

360
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,230
you were peeping?

361
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,110
What did you mean by ''15 minutes''?

362
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,880
It'll rain in 15 minutes.

363
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,280
You bet

364
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,190
it'll rain in two hours.

365
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,110
I bet in 15 minutes.

366
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,760
You can even guess this?

367
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,590
Huaiying,

368
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,430
did you deduce it again?

369
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,070
How did you do it?

370
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,040
Tell me.

371
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,830
You won't understand it.

372
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,040
Well...

373
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,110
Then deduce me.

374
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:15,880
Deduce me.

375
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,710
You're like a bowl of water.
I can see the end at a glance.

376
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,520
What do I have to deduce?

377
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,280
Di Renjie,

378
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,560
I have nothing

379
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,430
to say to you.

380
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,110
You don't need to say thank you.

381
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,040
Change it.

382
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,640
I'm a magistrate.

383
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,040
It's inappropriate for me

384
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,040
to wear stolen boots, right?

385
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,830
Your eyesight is bad?

386
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,760
Check the bottoms.

387
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,430
They're white.

388
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,520
They're new.

389
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,310
Do you know?

390
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,830
The magistrate of Penglai County

391
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,110
has been vacant for over three months,

392
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,830
but there's no single unsolved case.

393
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,520
What's wrong?

394
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,070
Isn't it good
that there's no unsolved case?

395
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,430
It's good for you.

396
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:52,950
For me,

397
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,000
I could only solve new cases.

398
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,310
We have a new case?

399
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,830
You stole someone else's money today.

400
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,310
This is the new case I need to solve.

401
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:08,310
You...

402
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,950
You want to catch me?

403
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,470
I'm an official now.

404
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,350
You're not an official.

405
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,110
You're just an officer.

406
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,310
No. You're even not an officer.

407
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,830
You're just one of my attendants.

408
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:20,560
I...

409
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,160
I stole the money to defend you.

410
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,040
That criminal...

411
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,800
That criminal is still out there.

412
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,160
That body is still lying there.

413
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,000
You don't go to catch the criminal.

414
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,880
You want to catch me?

415
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,070
Fifteen minutes.

416
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,880
If I win,

417
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,400
I'll bring you to justice.

418
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,950
What if I win?

419
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,400
You won't.

420
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:40,920
Also,

421
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,640
I forgot to tell you.

422
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,590
Those people in the streets of Penglai
wore white powder

423
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,310
on their faces because they had leprosy.

424
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,310
Who is it?

425
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,760
Isn't that the money bag I lost?

426
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,470
Lucky you.

427
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,110
Put it on her.

428
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,070
Are you okay?

429
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,760
Kidnapping a woman in broad daylight.

430
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,070
Who gave you the nerve?

431
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:42,520
You...

432
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,830
You're a thief.

433
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,560
I advise you to be smart.

434
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,560
If you break the rules of the Bazong,

435
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,070
he won't let you go.

436
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,070
Bazong?

437
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,190
As long as you're in Penglai,

438
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,680
you have to abide by his rules.

439
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,070
Bazong

440
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,400
is the King of Justice.

441
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,470
The King of Justice?

442
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,230
Come on.

443
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,000
What are you doing?

444
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,350
Don't you want to tie me up

445
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,230
and take me to see Bazong?

446
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,280
You go.

447
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,470
Tie her up.

448
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,880
I...

449
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:23,880
Hurry up.

450
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,880
Come on. Put it on me.

451
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,160
Put it on me.

452
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,830
Go.

453
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,310
Don't steal from people
with no family to support them.

454
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,430
Don't bully the elderly, the weak,
the sick, and the disabled.

455
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,520
That's the rule.

456
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,310
If you can't remember,

457
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,520
get out of Penglai.

458
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,920
Yes.

459
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,110
Take him down.

460
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,310
Next one.

461
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:06,710
Boss.

462
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:07,710
Here.

463
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,640
[Bazong]
A little girl.

464
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,280
Why so serious?

465
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,160
Untie her.

466
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,760
Okay. Untie her.

467
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,000
What are you doing?

468
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,640
What do you want?

469
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,400
You're Bazong.

470
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,760
That's right.

471
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:36,680
I heard

472
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,040
you're in charge here.

473
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,110
That's right.

474
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,950
Well, I'm curious.

475
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,830
If you're in charge,

476
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,110
what's Magistrate Di in charge of?

477
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,400
You work for the government.

478
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,560
That's right.

479
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:50,830
Let her go.

480
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,350
Go.

481
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:51,880
Quick.

482
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,520
What do you mean?

483
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,430
One who works for the government

484
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,350
is in the government's charge,

485
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,680
not mine.

486
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,800
Get her out of here.

487
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,430
Yes.

488
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:00,760
- Go.
- Don't move.

489
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:04,350
It's easier to invite the devil in
than to send him away.

490
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,830
I just heard your men say

491
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:10,190
that anyone who wants to live in Penglai

492
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,830
has to follow your rules.

493
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,470
I'm here today

494
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,760
just to tell you.

495
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,640
Di Renjie, Magistrate Di, is here.

496
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,230
From now on,

497
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,950
he's in charge of all of Penglai.

498
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,110
You can rest now.

499
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,760
Since ancient times,

500
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,760
the government is the government.

501
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,710
The Jianghu is the Jianghu.

502
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,590
The Jianghu is the Jianghu.

503
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,830
But don't forget,

504
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,000
there's still the law above us.

505
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,280
I have to take your Jianghu power

506
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,110
back from you to Magistrate Di.

507
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,470
Power isn't something you take.

508
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,230
It's something you earn.

509
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,760
You have to earn it yourself.

510
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:52,800
Then tell me.

511
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,400
How to earn it?

512
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,110
By drinking.

513
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,070
Right. Drinking.

514
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,760
Chug it.

515
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:05,230
Chug it.

516
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,000
Drink with Rong?

517
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,280
It's courting death.

518
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,350
Get up.

519
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,280
You wake up.

520
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,230
Get up.

521
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,470
Get up.

522
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,000
Magistrate, I didn't expect you

523
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,760
to come to my place so soon
after taking office.

524
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,310
I'm honored.

525
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,640
When I was passing by,

526
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,640
I heard you play a Bingzhou ditty.

527
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,430
I wonder

528
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,680
if you could play it again for me.

529
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,520
The director told me

530
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,520
that it was you.

531
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,710
We have many singers here.

532
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,280
She must

533
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,350
have made a mistake.

534
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,520
Why don't

535
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,830
I sing Mr. Teng's new piece

536
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,880
for you, Magistrate?

537
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,280
That won't be necessary.

538
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,830
You don't like Mr. Teng's poetry?

539
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,880
The theme of love and romance

540
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,640
is not what I like.

541
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,230
Unexpectedly,

542
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,760
you don't understand romance.

543
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,800
Mr. Teng is well-known.

544
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,470
Even though he has no children,

545
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,520
he has no intention of taking a concubine.

546
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,280
He's deeply in love

547
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,400
with his wife Yinlian.

548
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,520
What he wrote and said in his poetry

549
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,560
is also the hope

550
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,400
of living happily with his wife.

551
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,110
Even His Majesty

552
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,040
would be moved by it

553
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,640
and granted him two words,
''Elegant Affection''.

554
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,760
All this

555
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,880
can't move you?

556
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,070
You're so well-informed.

557
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,430
You don't look like

558
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,190
a common singer living
in a remote place like Penglai.

559
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,190
Do you know where I come from?

560
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,160
When my father was in the capital,

561
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,000
did he have dealings
with an official named Cao?

562
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,280
18 years ago,

563
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,880
an official was confiscated

564
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,760
for illegally minting coins.

565
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,880
It's Cao Hexian.

566
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,070
That pouch is old,

567
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,280
but it's not something you'd expect

568
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,830
from a commoner.

569
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,800
The colored glaze on the side of the pouch

570
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,400
is also not ordinary.

571
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,950
You do like to investigate, Magistrate.

572
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,040
You're so perceptive.

573
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,190
Nothing escapes your notice.

574
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,160
I'm sure you're from Jinzhou.

575
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,590
Because I want to hear a Bingzhou ditty.

576
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,190
That's the first reason.

577
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:58,880
What is the second?

578
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,880
I've traveled to Bingzhou

579
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,760
and have seen the culture

580

and people there.

581
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,880
The original plectrum
on this pipa is broken,

582
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,430
so I can't play the heavy sound.

583
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,590
