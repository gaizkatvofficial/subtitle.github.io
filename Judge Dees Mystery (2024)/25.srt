00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,200
In Qingchuan,

8
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,880
there has been no rain for a long time.

Commander Xiao,

10
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,160
thank you

11
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,880
for your help in this case.

12
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,080
I will report to the court

13
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,320
and commend you for your efforts.

14
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,160
I could help...

15
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:25,720
But

16
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,320
we should conduct business impartially.

17
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,400
Qingchuan

18
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,040
can't be like this forever,

19
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,600
especially the military management...

20
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,400
So, what is your idea?

21
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,120
Two points.

22
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,360
First,

23
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,760
all the populace should move out.

24
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:44,920
Qingchuan

25
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,520
should be managed by the military.

26
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,000
Well...

27
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,080
Second,

28
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,040
from now on,

29
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,760

The military
and the magistrate of Lanfang County

32
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,880

34
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,080
what is your opinion?

35
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,080
Since this is your decision,

36
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,120
I should

37
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,800
adhere to the policies of yours.

The future

42

43
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,160
Magistrate,

44
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,040
I'm honored to be able

45
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,080
to help you

46
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,840
this time.

47

50
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,000
everything will get better.

51
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,160
Take care of yourself.

52
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,080
Your mother

53
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,320
would also want you to live well.

54
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,240
Remember,

55
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,720
the past

56
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,720
will only make you stronger.

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,640
I've arranged with Mr. Hulu

58
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,160
to take you together

59
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,680
from now on.

60
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,520
You will live rough

61
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,080
and travel around,

62
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,360
but I'm sure

63
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,560
no one will ever mistreat you again.

64
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,360
Would you like to?

65
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,160
Can I take that red dress with me?

66
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,640
Of course.

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,760
Go ahead.

68
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,920
Mr. Hulu,

69
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,200
I'd like to ask

70
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,640
one more thing.

71
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,840
Why did you save me

72
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,640
when we first met?

73
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,280
Why

74
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,640
do I feel that we've known each other

75
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,800
before?

76
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,520
I knew who you were

77
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,520
when I first met you.

78
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,600
Who

79
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,280
am I?

80
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,800
You are the only one

81
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,240
who knows who you truly are.

82
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,950
There is no set date for my return.

83
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,070
Magistrate Di,

84
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,640
take care.

85
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,360
I have a piece of advice for you.

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,560
Eat and drink when you should,

87
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,600
and don't take things too personally.

88
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,600
Eat and drink

89
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,360
when I should,

90
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,920
and don't take things too personally.

91
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,320
If that's the case,

92
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,320
there's no difference

93
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,080
from being a dog.

94
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,440
Look at me.

95
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,640

time to go.

100
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,240
Sit still.

not pursuing desire.

benefiting from simplicity and inaction

108
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,400

112

120

all the people listed in this roster

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,120
But I stopped her.

195
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,920
What time is it?

196
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,920
What time is it?

197
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,040
It's already past mealtime.

198
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,120
Let's go...

199
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:24,920
Come back with me.

200
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,640
What are you watching here?

201
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,280
Watching people coming and going.

202
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,800
Watching the intertwining streets
and alleys.

203
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,800
A corner of the city, yet unknown to me,

204
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,840
is the place where he is hiding.

205
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,280
Who?

206
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,680
Heiyan.

207
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,080
Wasn't Heiyan eradicated by you
long ago?

208
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,560
Even if there were some survivors,

209
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,480
they couldn't cause huge trouble.

210
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,680
Hong,

211
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,560
how do you view Heiyan?

212
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,160
Just a couple of gangsters

213
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,200
violating the laws.

214
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,960
I thought the same way in the beginning.

215
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,600
It wasn't until I eradicated those gangs

216
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,560
in Lanfang County.

217
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:16,920
I found that, among them,

218
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,120
those who were really close to Heiyan

219
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,400
were very few.

220
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,960
You mean

221
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,680
the real Heiyan group members

222
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,560
are still hidden?

223
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,880
Behind the scenes,

224
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,400
they are manipulating everything.

225
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,320
I even think

226
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,440
that the so-called Heiyan

227
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,560
is actually

228
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,680
just one person.

229
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,480
How can one person be a group?

230
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,920
Did you forget

231
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,480
what they did in Penglai?

232
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,800
I haven't figured out this point.

233
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,760
But if Heiyan is not eradicated,

234
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,280
endless troubles will lie ahead.

235
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,320
Okay...

236
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,680
Just stop thinking
if you can't figure it out.

237
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,760
The transfer order is on the way,

238
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,960
and we will leave Lanfang County soon.

239
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,560
Let others handle the matters that follow.

240
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,240
Let's go...

241
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,740
[Lanfang County Magistrate's Office]

242
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,800
Mr. Hong,

243
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,120
these are fruits and candies prepared
by the Magistrate's Office.

244
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,520
Okay.

245
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,520
Put them there.

246
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,880
You have been checking all day.

247
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,880
Have you decided on the date?

248
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,400
It's not easy to choose a good day.

249
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,800
All people in the Magistrate's Office

250
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,600
are hoping to share the good fortune
of the Magistrate.

251
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,600
We are excited.

252
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,590
Do you think
I don't know your intentions?

253
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,350
You want to have some days off

254
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:55,960
and enjoy drinking.

255
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,280
It's the Magistrate's wedding feast,

256
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,800
and we surely should enjoy drinking.

257
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,350
Please stay reassured.

258
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,310
You will definitely have fun on that day.

259
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,920
There are sky lanterns.

260
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,000
Let's set off the lanterns at night.

261
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,720
Great.

262
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,400
Look.

263
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,760
What color do you like?

264
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,360
Magistrate,

265
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,880
Lanfang County

266
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,680
has changed greatly
compared with before.

267
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,920
Congratulations!

268
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,800
Congratulations...

269
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,200
Congratulations!

270
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,760
Congratulations...

271
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,640
Congratulations!

272
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,240
You said

273
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,080
that Lanfang County

274
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,920
has changed greatly
compared with before.

275
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,280
Is that so?

276
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,920
Magistrate,

277
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,560
I have an appointment with Miss Cao.

278
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,240
Tonight, we'll set off sky lanterns
and make a wish.

279
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,400
What wish do you want to make?

280
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,680
Speaking wishes aloud nullifies them.

281
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,560
Let's go.

282
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:23,180
[Lanfang County]

283
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,800
Make a wish.

284
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,520
What wish should I make?

285
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,280
Speak out all your

286
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,320
unspeakable wishes.

287
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,880
My wishes are aboveboard.

288
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,960
Tell me then.

289
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,600
I hope

290
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,000
all under Heaven can be at peace,

291
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,080
and the nation prospers forever.

292
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,880
Look, something is approaching.

293
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,640
It looks like a cart.

294
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,600
Why is there no rider?

295
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,320
Right. The cart has no rider.

296
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,640
Excuse me...

297
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,120
Excuse me.

298
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:01,920
Excuse me.

299
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:06,920
Stop them.

300
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,160
Everyone, don't go over there.

301
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,920
Stop there.

302
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,680
Please don't go over there.

303
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,480
Isn't it...?

304
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:32,880
Who?

305
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,560
No one...

306
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,480
I mean,

307
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,480
why is the cart

308
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,920
without a rider?

309
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,920
How strange!

310
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:41,760
That's weird.

311
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,720
It was cut by a sword or an axe.

312
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,520
Beyond this,

313
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,360
I know nothing.

314
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,360
The paper effigy is well made, though.

315
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,520
I have never seen that before.

316
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,280
Qiao Tai is conducting
city-wide inquiries

317
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,040
into the origins of the paper effigy.

318
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,560
I'm afraid

319
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,440
he will find nothing.

320
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:24,880
In my opinion,

321
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,680
we should go through

322
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,440
the records of the missing people

323
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,640
of Lanfang County in the last ten years.

324
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,520
Ten years!

325
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,840
I don't fear the numerous case files.

326
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,240
But where should I start?

327
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,360
Girl.

328
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,240
About 20 years old.

329
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,800
Beautiful.

330
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,000
Why did the murderer

331
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,880
put the skull

332
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,360
in the paper effigy?

333
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,800
All your goods are here?

334
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,640
Yes, they are all here.

335
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,560
Is there another effigies workshop
in the city?

336
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,520
Lanfang County is a small place.

337
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,840
Mine is the only one.

338
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,120
It's late at night. What is

339
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,720
the knocking noise?

340
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,600
It's Mason Ling

341
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,520
carving tombstones.

342
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,360
In Lanfang County,
Ling's shop is the only one

343
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,520
that carves tombstones.

344
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,960
Has anyone come to inquire?

345
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,360
Magistrate,

346
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,640
everyone took a detour,

347
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,240
and no one came to inquire about it.

348
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,800
What a rich man!

349
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,400
The cart and the horse

350
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,000
must be worth lots of money,

351
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,200
and he decided to discard them.

352
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,800
If they were not stolen,

353
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,040
there is only one reason.

354
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,520
What's this?

355
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,360
Untie the horse.

356
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,400
Magistrate.

357
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,160
Put it on.

358
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:54,680
Come.

359
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,640
Magistrate,

360
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,720
where are we going?

361
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,640
An old horse knows the way.

362
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,000
Have you heard the saying?

363
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,200
An old horse knows the way.

364
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,120
Magistrate,

365
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,720
you are brilliant!

366
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,640
Shh.

367
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,080
Cut out the flattery.

368
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,440
I didn't.

369
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,840
I do feel you are brilliant!

370
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,200
I know that.

371
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,920
Are we going to walk overnight?

372
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,840
Here we are.

373
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,760
This family held a wedding.

374
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,160
Is it appropriate to knock on the door?

375
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,880
Just knock.

376
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,800
Hello?

377
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,520
We're entering.

378
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,160

Go back and bring some people.

381

Keep your hand in the air.

382

I've been doing it for a long time.

383
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:08,880
What are you doing?

384
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,480
This cloth is for your wedding.

385
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,880
Miss Cao's instrument.

386
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,200
Play chess.

387
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:37,400
I...

388
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,120
I don't know how to play.

389
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,480
I can teach you.

390
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,760
You can play.

391
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,480
When will you

392
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,600
ever finish playing chess like this?

393
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,400
How about this?

394
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,880
Do as I say.

395
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,800
Cannon moves horizontally

396
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,360
from column 8 to column 7.

397
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,920
Cannon moves horizontally
from column 2 to column 5.

398
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,080
Cannon moves horizontally
from column 2 to column 5.

399
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,840
Knight moves diagonally forward 2 spaces
from column 2 to column 3.

400
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,400
Knight moves diagonally forward 2 spaces
from column 8 to column 9.

401
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,560
Pawn moves vertically forward
for 1 space from column 7.

402
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,200
Rook moves horizontally
from column 9 to column 8.

403
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,680
Rook moves vertically forward
for 1 space from column 1.

404
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,560
Capture it.

405
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,000
Capture it,

406
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,360
and you can

407
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,760
slash her first.

408
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,320
You love her,

409
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,240
so you can't bear

410
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,440
to slash her.

411
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,320
It's fine.

412
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,680
But

413
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,280
I'll cut your fingers

414
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,800
one by one

415
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,560
until you bleed to death.

416
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,480
Slash her.

417
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,800
Do it!

418
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,600
Your turn.

419
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,400
I...

420
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,440
Just do it.

421
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,400
Very good.

422
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,400
You love each other,

423
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,840
so you can't bear to hurt each other.

424
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,840
How about this?

425
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,440
Let me give you an idea.

426
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,800
Think carefully

427
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,320
about the mistakes you made.

428
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,600
For example,

429
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,630
your wife flirted

430
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,190
with Mr. Wang from the West of the City.

431
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:04,150
Your husband spent the night

432
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,440
before your wedding in a brothel,

433
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,480
drinking.

434
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,710
In this case,

435
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,600
will you play chess better?

436
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:19,080
You've got reasons.

437
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,560
Slash!

438
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,320
I think your wife loves you less.

439
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,230
She slashed harder than you.

440
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,360
Then you went on a killing spree.

441
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,480
Then,

442
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,360
you killed her,

443
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,560
and you

444
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,240
killed him.

445
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,200
Both were dead.

446
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,160
After that,

447
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,920
I dug out your hearts.

448
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,920
Two hearts

449
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,080
that once loved each other.

450
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,600
This is the truth behind the case.

451
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,040
Magistrate,

452
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,160
Mr. Hong invited you to pay a visit.

453
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,280
Does your face hurt?

454
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,040
He won't be coming back, will he?

455
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,040
I'll play dead for a while.

456
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,680
Huaiying,

457
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,600
check the exquisite craftsmanship

458
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,120
of the earrings.

459
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,160
They are made from good materials.

460
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,520
I don't think they belonged to her.

461
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,240
Magistrate,

462
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,360
I've inquired about them.

463
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,920
This couple

464
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,400
was kind and friendly

465
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,440
and

466
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,840
had no enemies.

467
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,480
The point is

468
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,040
they just got married before the murder.

469
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,000
There is no chance
of an extramarital affair.

470
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,960
The deceased didn't have pierced ears.

471
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,280
The earrings

472
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,520
were forcefully pressed in the ears.

473
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,800
Investigate the origin of the earrings.

474
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,640
[Gambling House]
Big...

475
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,560
- Small.
- Big.

476
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,080
Have you seen this?

477
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,400
No.

478
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,080
You all have never seen this?

479
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,600
I have never seen this.

480
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,320
Have you seen it?

481
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,040
No.

482
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,800
Miss Ma,

483
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,440
we have never seen this thing.

484
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,760
But if you were to bet it on the table,

485
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,320
it would be ours.

486
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:44,840
Yes.

487
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:47,920
Then tell me,

488
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,560
how much is this pair of earrings worth?

489
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:51,880
I'll give you this amount.

490
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,520
This amount?

491
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,240
Yes.

492
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,800
Are you joking?

493
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,120
You have blind eyes.

494
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,080
I'll leave.

495
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,360
Miss Ma,

496
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,680
I can add more if you feel it's little.

497
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,360
Why does she go?

498
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,240
I've roamed through every humble place
in the entire city.

499
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,200
No one knows this.

500
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,080
It shouldn't be like this.

501
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,320
Someone has died!

502
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,160
Someone has died!

503
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,080
Self-castration.

504
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,680
He lost too much blood.

505
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,760
Take it away.

506
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,160
Tai,

507
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,240
what is self-castration?

508
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,640
You shouldn't have come.

509
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,040
Greetings from Qiuyue, Magistrate.

510
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,600
Long time no see.

511
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,600
It's been a long time.

512
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,880
How have you been?

513
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,560
I've been busy,

514
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,680
so I have no time to see you.

515
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,920
You're being too kind.

516
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,800
I should have gone to your office

517
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,240
to see you often.

518
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,480
Besides,

519
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,680
your status

520
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,440
makes it improper for you

521
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,200
to come here.

522
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:34,840
Do you know

523
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:35,920
this man?

524
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,720
I do.

525
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,080
His surname is Loong.

526
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,800
He is a butcher in the city

527
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,320
and a regular guest here.

528
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,960
But a few days ago,

529
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,520
I instructed the ladies

530
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,160
not to do business with him anymore.

531
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:50,920
Why?

532
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,640
He has odd hobbies.

533
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,600
He liked to use needles for piercing

534
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,880
and whips for lashing.

535
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,680
Not only did he hurt people,

536
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,400
but he also often gives less
than what's due.

537
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,560
I've heard that many shops in the city

538
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,000
stopped doing business with him.

539
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,320
Yao,

540
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,000
please recount the details

541
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,440
of what happened to the Magistrate.

542
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,360
Just now,

543
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,560
I was accompanying my guest in the yard.

544
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,400
I saw Loong coming with a knife.

545
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,360
I thought

546
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,840
he came to hurt us because we stopped

547
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,080
doing business with him.

548
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,360
Where are you?

549
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,520
[Loong]
I am an animal.

550
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,800
I'm not a human.

551
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,800
You promised me

552
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,760
that you would spare my mother.

553
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,120
Spare my mother!

554
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:54,960
You mean

555
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,840
that he was like calling out to someone.

556
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,200
Yeah.

557
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,200
I saw that he was looking at something.

558
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,240
So, I followed his looking direction

559
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,160
and found a man

560
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,320
on the second floor.

561
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:06,800
Where?

562
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,480
Just there.

563
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,320
Once Loong died,

564
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,840
that man disappeared.

565
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,160
What does

566
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,880
that man look like?

567
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,200
He was wearing a cloak

568
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,120
and a mask.

569
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,400
I... I didn't see his face.

570
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,400
Mask?
