00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,110
That night,

177
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,670

178

181
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,440
Why would he do anything against her?

182
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,670
Maybe he was told to do it.

183
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,030
Back then,

184
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,790

185

to death for rebellion,

186
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,640
but his family survived

187
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,080
because

188

Afterward,

190
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,280
he was recommended

191

how can I help you?

203

I have found out the truth.

204
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,590
So, who was it?

205
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,400
The Empress's guard,

206
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,350
Kang Zhiyi.

207
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,350
He stole the Phoenix Seal,

208
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,790
forged the imperial decree,

209
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,710
and ordered the Yulin Guards to poison
and kill Chen Zhuliang.

210
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:32,710
Then,

211
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,640
he set fire to kill the palace maid Yaxin,
who was responsible for the Seal,

212
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,670
as well as the four Yulin Guards,
who delivered the forged imperial decree.

213
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,960
This is not the place to talk.

214

Kang Zhiyi

215
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,030
has been guarding the Empress

216
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,030
since she entered the palace

217
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,880
and is trusted by the Empress.

218
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,320
Even with the Phoenix Seal missing,

219
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,000
there's no reason to suspect him.

220
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,590
But I found out

221
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,840
that Kang Huai'en is Kang Zhiyi's father.

222
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,440
Back then, the one
who saved the Kang family

223
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,910
from being executed

224
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,910
was Zhangsun Qing.

225
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,590
In the first year of the Yonghui Reign,

226
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,520
the late Emperor passed away.

227
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,080
Kang Zhiyi returned to Chang'an.

228
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,150
The person who guaranteed his entry
into the Jinwu Guards

229
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,150
was also Zhangsun Qing.

230
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,790
So you suspect that Zhangsun
ordered him to commit the crime?

231
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,790
Zhangsun Qing
is the Empress' biggest political rival.

232
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,000
He had reason to frame the Empress.

233
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,000
On the night of the incident
at Jushui Entertainment House,

234
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,080
Kang Zhiyi was meeting Zhangsun Qing

Just with your testimony,

wouldn't care.

Let me tell you something else.

253
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,400
Zhangsun Qing has worked
with Minister Xu Yuan

254
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,670
and Left Vice Director Sun Zhining

255

and written to His Majesty together.

Deposing the Empress

257

is only a matter of time.

258
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,150
However, the Empress

259
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,790
is protected by Xu Jingzong
and other ministers.

260
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,880
They can fight, though.

261
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:18,960
However,

262
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,030
Zhangsun Qing served
under three emperors.

263
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,670
He's a minister of honor,
a relative of the Emperor,

264
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,080
and the highest leader
of Tang's noble forces.

who oppose the Empress.

267
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,790

You can't cut it down.

270
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,080
It's a massive tree.

271
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,910
But if it fails from the inside,

272
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,550
we can cut it down

But I always feel empty inside.

This is Chang'an.

It's all about power struggles.

There are no supernatural beings.

I shouldn't have let you

517
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,710
wishing that the Heavenly Fire disappears

518
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,830
and people can enjoy peace forever.

519
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,830
Thank you, Grand Commandant.

520
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:12,760
It is useless.

521
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,520
The Heavenly Fire

522
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,000
will come again.

523
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:21,680
Fire

524
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,710
is the hexagram "Radiance" in Bagua.

525
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,070
The upper and lower trigrams
of the hexagram

526
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,160
both have five lines.

527
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,000
That means

528
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:27,880
the Heavenly Fire

529
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,400
will come at least five times.

530
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:34,160
Five times?

531
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,160
When will the next fire come?

532
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:36,710
Right.

533
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,710
Fire is the utmost yang,

534
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,040
attracted by the sun.

535
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,640
It will change every three days.

536
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,400
Since the last Heavenly Fire

537
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,400
destroyed the silkworm house,

538
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,190
it has been 24 hours.

539
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,070
That means,

540
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,430
in two days,

541
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:51,710
the Heavenly Fire

542
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,280
will surely come again.

543
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,000
Where will it be this time?

544
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,680
Does it still have something
to do with the Empress?

545
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:03,430
Of course.

546
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,590
The Heavenly Fire

547
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,800
first burned down

548
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:11,110
the Empress's favorite Wutong tree.

549
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,160
For the second time,

550
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,430
it set fire

551
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,590
to the entertainment house
praised by the Empress.

552
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,350
For the third time,

553
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,110
it burned

554
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,110
the farmer who raised silkworms for her.

555
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,310
Then the next one...

556
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,430
By order of the Empress,

557
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,520
he's compiling Great Families

558
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,190
based on the Record of Eminent Families
from the Zhenguan Period.

559
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:39,000
The Empress's four families
are listed in the first class.

560
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,590
Grand Commandant Zhangsun

561
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,310
will have a hard time in the future.

562
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,190
Great Families.

563
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,110
This is the Empress's
biggest political move

564
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,680
in recent years.

565
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,190
The order of the world

566
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,280
will be reset.

567
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,710
If the Heavenly Fire

568
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,680
hates the new world,

569
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,070
then

570
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,830
it will come to it.

571
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,760
What if

572
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,800
the Heavenly Fire stops?

573
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,430
Then it means

574
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,070
there is no Heavenly Fire.

575
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,310
Everything

576
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,710
is man-made

577
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:29,160
to frame the Empress.

578
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,000
Who is

579
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,000
this man?

580
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,800
Di Zhixun's son,

581
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,760
Di Renjie.

582
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,280
When we get out of here,

583
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,760
you'll all listen to my command.

584
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,800
We'll move as one.

585
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,590
When we get out,

586
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,230
don't all go the same way.

587
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,230
Let's split up.

588
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,040
But our ultimate goal

589
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,950
is to go to Lanling Ward.

590
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,000
Understand?

591
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,000
Yes, sir.

592
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,800
Please forgive me, Mr. Wei.

593
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,230
Forgive you for what?

594
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,430
I deliberately enraged Zhangsun Qing

595
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,160
and put you and your students

596
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,280
in danger

597
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,040
so that he and Kang Zhiyi

598
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,000
would take the initiative

599
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,040
and reveal themselves.

600
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,000
Only then

601
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,520
will I be able

602
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,800
to catch them in the act

603
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,830
and expose their plot.

604
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:06,310
You're leaving an empty house as bait.

605
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:09,160
He will be able to tell

606
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,590
that you're egging him on.

607
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,590
They've already killed so many people.

608
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,710
If they don't bring down the Empress,

609
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:18,680
they'll lose everything.

610
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,000
I bet

611
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,470
they'll take the risk.

612
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,920
You want them to go to Lanling Ward?

613
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:38,560
Yes.

614
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,920
As far as I know,

615
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:44,280
Di's Residence is in Lanling Ward.

616
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,800
No one will remember

617
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,400
that guilty man.

618
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:57,230
A forgotten place

619
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:58,760
is the safest.

620
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,470
I'll escort you there myself.

621
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,710
I'm not going.

622
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,950
I'll stay.

623
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,110
Mr. Wei.

624
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,190
I'm over 50 years old.

625
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,160
Life and death

626
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,280
are no longer my concern.

627
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,040
I want to stay and see the Heavenly Fire
with my own eyes.

628
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,830
It's too risky.

629
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:28,830
Mr. Wei.

630
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:29,470
Huaiying,

631
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,070
stop trying to talk me out of it.

632
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,470
People

633
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,470
can't

634
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,920
escape their fate after all.

635
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,110
If I can have a chance

636
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,280
to see the real face
of the manipulator of fate,

637
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:47,760
it's worth it.

638
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,350
I will be sure to keep you safe.

639
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:09,100
[Wei's Residence]

640
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,080
Good.

641
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:22,800
Bravo.

642
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,520
Wonderful.
