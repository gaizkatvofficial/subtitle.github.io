00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,980
[Based on the novel of the same name
by the Dutch author Robert van Gulik]

[Episode 23]

00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,980
[This is a work of fiction.
Any resemblance is purely coincidental.]

5
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,680
Sir,

6
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,680
what's your name?

7
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,420
[Lang Liu]

8
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,880
I'm Lang Liu.

9
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm passing through here on business.

10
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,680
May I ask

11
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,880
your name?

12
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,960
I'm a healer.

13
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,240
My surname is Lin.

14
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,440
I'm practicing medicine here.

15
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,760
Healer...

16
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,880
Healer Lin.

17
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,040
Fate has brought us together.

18
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,440
It's fate.

19
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,240
Please help yourself.

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,880
Excuse me

21
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,600
for my abrupt questions.

22
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,120
Where

23
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,760
are you from?

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,160
Where are you going?

25
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,200
What are you selling?

26
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,400
I'm

27
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,760
from

28
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,320
where I come from.

29
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,240
I'll go to the place where I will go.

30
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,560
I can't tell you

31
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,920
what I'm selling.

32
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,080
Healer Lin,

33
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,480
are you satisfied

34
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,760
with my answer?

35
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,480
In this world,

36
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,360
there are always secrets

37
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,440
to keep.

38
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,520
I can understand.

39
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,520
I often

40
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,680
have to

41
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,240
dig up secrets

42
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,320
from patients.

43
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,040
Sorry for asking you those questions.

44
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,120
It doesn't matter.

45
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,080
You are used to asking questions,

46
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,840
but I can't answer.

47
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,080
A merchant

48
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,640
does not always have everything.

49
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,360
A good healer

50
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,520
may not be a cure-all.

51
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,840
Well said.

52
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
There are some diseases

53
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,440
in this world

54
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,600
that even a good healer

55
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,880
can't cure.

56
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,920
But

57
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,520
I've always wanted

58
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,600
to cure

59
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,960
all incurable diseases.

60
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,680
You

61
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,280
aim for the highest.

62
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,360
But

63
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,640
the way things are these days...

64
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,720
Forget it.

65
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,200
I

66
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,120
wish you

67
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,280
all the best

68
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,720
in Qingchuan.

69
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,640
Well,

70
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,960
the noodles are too bland.

71
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,680
I'll add some salt for you later.

72
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,440
Add salt.

73
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,160
Add some ants for you.

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,080
What are you looking for?

75
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,160
Let me see

76
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,440
whether there are free ants in my bowl.

77
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,680
Your smile is so beautiful.

78
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,000
Your mother

79
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,000
must be beautiful.

80
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,800
Hurry up. What are you doing?

81
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:40,840
Coming.

82
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,360
Don't waste my time.

83
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,360
You are so slow.

84
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,040
Healer Lin.

85
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,320
Mr. Lang.

86
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,440
It's so late at night.

87
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,480
With everything

88
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,840
going on lately,

89
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,520
I'm a little upset.

90
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,720
I'll get some air.

91
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,160
The moon is clear tonight.

92
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,280
Healer Lin,

93
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,040
shall we...?

94
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,080
Forgive me for being rude.

95
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,240
Wei.

96
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,240
Do you also need salt?

97
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,680
Sit down.

98
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,480
Do you know

99
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
what Mr. Lang

100
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,800
sells?

101
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,080
He sells silks and satins.

102
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,240
He has booked

103
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,360
some of the best rooms in this inn.

104
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,800
The warehouses around the corner
also belong to him.

105
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,120
I don't think

106
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,720
he likes you very much.

107
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,800
Your stepfather...

108
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,120
No one likes me.

109
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,640
There are indeed

110
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,120
rumors in town

111
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,160
that something big is about to happen.

112
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,960
The mastermind

113
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,720
can't be Heiyan you mentioned, can it?

114
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,040
I'm

115
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,760
from where I come from.

116
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,520
I'll go to the place where I will go.

117
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,600
I can't tell you clearly

118
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,880
what I'm selling.

119
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,680
Are you satisfied

120
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,240
with my answer?

121
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,740
[Green Bird Inn]

122
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,560
Mr. Wei.

123
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,440
Magistrate Di,

124
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,120
do you really

125
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,040
enjoy the dark night?

126
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,040
Who are you?

127
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,800
You invited me to Qingchuan.

128
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,720
I'm not in the mood for that.

129
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,400
How did you know me?

130
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,440
You are the famous Magistrate Di
in Lanfang County.

131
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,040
Is there anything wrong
with me knowing you?

132
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,840
Are you

133
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,480
also staying in this inn?

134
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,200
I stay

135
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,680
wherever it stops.

136
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,920
Tonight,

137
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,280
we are here.

138
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,000
Tomorrow night,

139
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,440
I hope it can find a warmer place.

140
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,080
Healer Lin,

141
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,280
it's getting late.

142
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,120
Stalking people,

143
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,800
you could

144
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,080
get into an accident.

145
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,280
Mr. Hulu,

146
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,640
are you a native of Qingchuan?

147
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,360
So many years have passed.

148
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,920
I can't remember.

149
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,640
Do you know

150
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,680
something big

151
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,960
is about to happen in this place?

152
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,080
I've lived in Qingchuan

153
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
long enough.

154
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,000
But everybody ignores me.

155
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,240
They all think I'm a lunatic.

156
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,440
They just nodded

157
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,840
when they greeted me.

158
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,400
Only you

159
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,360
dare to speak to me.

160
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,080
Yes.

161
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,440
Perhaps

162
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,910
you think I'm one of your patients,

163
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,880
Healer Lin.

164
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,040
You are from Heiyan.

165
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,240
Have you

166
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,880
always been

167
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,120
so curious?

168
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,560
Magistrate Di.

169
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,120
Sometimes,

170
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,200
it's better

171
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,360
not to know.

172
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:07,960
I'm leaving.

173
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,280
He also owns a few warehouses
at the street corner.

174
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,880
The smell of blood.

175
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,320
Who are you?

176
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,240
I want to know who you are.

177
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,120
You are too nosy.

178
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,960
You are going

179
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,600
to die here today!

180
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,520
Don't fight.

181
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,680
It's not good to fight.

182
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,240
But nobody listens to me.

183
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,120
Kill him!

184
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,360
Look.

185
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,760
Sorry.

186
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,680
Sorry.

187
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,200
Sorry.

188
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,280
Sorry.

189
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,360
I'm exhausted.

190
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,920
I'm exhausted.

191
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,640
I'm exhausted.

192
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,640
I didn't know

193
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,280
you had such talent.

194
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,480
I have no talent.

195
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,240
I just used their own strength
against them.

196
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,800
Do you understand?

197
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,800
You don't?

198
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,600
Young man,

what were you doing

206
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,240

What else can I do with my wagon?

209

Of course, I was delivering goods.

and saying a few words.

You can walk on the streets.

Most importantly,

00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,160
you are always free as a bird.

393

You can go wherever you want.

394

You don't let anything get in your way.

395
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,400
You can do whatever you want.

396
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,320
You don't have to read people's faces.

397

Many girls can only imagine

398
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,560
what you have seen

399
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,160
and what you have experienced

400
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,320
in their lifetime.

401
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,680
With this,

402
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,120
you are a hundred times better

You travel a lot

407
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,880
and see a lot.

408
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,160
Your mindset

409
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,120
is naturally different from others.

410
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,480
In my opinion,

411
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,600
it is most important

412
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,720
for a person

413
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,760
to be able to support himself.

414
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,120
You are not supporting yourself.

According to the Code,

419
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,080
my salary is 300 qian a month.

422
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:49,880
So,

423
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,960
when you buy those things,

424
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,400
you are spending your own money?

425
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,160
Aren't you the same?

426
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,560
Yes, indeed.

428
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,600
Of course.

I also believe Qiao Tai

433

will wake up soundly.

434

Why don't we do something

435

An autopsy is unnecessary.

Their bodies have been buried.

Upas?

473
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,240
It is recorded in this book

474
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,600
that upas is native to Tianzhu.

475
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,240
If the roots are extracted,

476
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,760
it can cause a person to fall unconscious.

477
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,520

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,960
my ancestor's good reputation.

581
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,080
You are an offspring of Xiao Yiran?

582
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,720
Yes.

583
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,040
You...

584
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,280
I was in a very important position

585
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,400
in the army before.

586
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,480
Because I was too straightforward,

587
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,880
I was banished here.

588
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,240
I see.

589
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,280
That's why I became indolent.

590
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,800
I'm unworthy of my ancestors.

591
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,600
Magistrate,

592
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,040
you have come here.

593
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,440
Something big is surely going to happen.

594
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,640
If you don't tell me,

595
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,080
I won't ask.

596
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,800
There are around a hundred people

597
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,480
under my command.

598
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,000
I've brought them all here.

599
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,760
They are waiting outside the inn.

600
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,280
If you need me,

601
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,000
I'm

602
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,800
at your disposal.

603
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,240
Are your shoulder and neck

604
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,640
feeling better?

605
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,360
Yes.

606
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,840
Go back then.

607
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,160
If I need you,

608
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,680
I'll go to you at any time.

609
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,040
Understood.
