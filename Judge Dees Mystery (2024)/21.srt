give this letter

12
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,240
to the military office.

13
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,080
It's about the entire process
of their mutiny.

14
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,080
Will they be sentenced to death?

15
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,200
They are just accessory criminals.

16
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,560
They did a great job
in suppressing the bandits.

17
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,720
They will be sent back
to their place of origin.

18
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,160
Magistrate,

19
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,960
no one will know

20
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,400
what happened here today

21
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,760
as long as we don't report it.

22
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,520
Just this once.

23

Just this once.

24
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,840
Okay?

25
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,000
Why do you insist on punishing them?

26
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,720
These soldiers

27
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,280
just fought the bandits like hell.

28
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,280
Can't they make up for it?

29
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,640
Zhou Changyi

30
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,560
even lost his life.

31
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,920
Isn't it enough?

32
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,120
No one will remember

33
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,320
how they were abused.

34
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,000
No one will remember

35
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,960
how they fought the enemies bravely.

36
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,720
If you send them back to their hometown,

37
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,880
people will think they are criminals.

38
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,680
It's their duty

39
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,360
to kill the enemy.

40
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,480
It's their crime

41
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,520
to kill their own people.

42
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,360
Don't confuse

00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,320

44
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,720
Although Zhou Changyi

45
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,040
is dead,

46
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,360
his sin cannot be forgiven.

47
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,960
He must be punished by the law of Tang.

48
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,320
After you go back to Magistrate's Office,

49
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,200
tell Mr. Hong

50
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,080
to withdraw 2,000 qian

51

54
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,880
I'll leave

55
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,360

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,760
Where are you going?

57
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,000
Catch Han Yongnan.

58
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,920
Having a superior like that,

59
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,600
it's not easy for you.

60
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,720
To Zhou Changyi.

61
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,960
You didn't catch the ones
you should catch,

62
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,160
but caught the ones you shouldn't.

63
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,320
Now your life is in danger.

64
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,120
Is it worth it?

65
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,480
Daguan,

66
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,080
if your persistence

67
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,680
is just making people feel bad,

68
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,720
what's the point of it?

69
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,240
You should have killed

70
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,200
Han Yongnan.

71
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,960
You shouldn't have let him escape
from Lanfang County.

72
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,800
That way, it wouldn't have involved

73
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,760
so many people and things.

74
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,400
I will find him

75
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,600
and let him be punished by the law.

76
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,360
The law of Tang has been made

77
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,680
for less than a hundred years.

78
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,480

Anyhow,

84
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,440
without these things,

85
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,840
how could Tang

86
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,400
be founded?

87
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,360
I'll ask you one last question.

88
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,440
If in Lanfang County,

89
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,800
he killed your lover,

90
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,480
would you kill him on the spot?

91
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,920
I've told you.

92
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,320
I will catch him in person

93
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,800
and let him be punished by the law,

94
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,800
no matter who he has killed.

95
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,680
Fine.

96
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,560

97
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,720
See you next time.

99
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,720
I don't want her if she is over 13.

100

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,080

An hour ago,

00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,880
he was heading for Yiwu County.

Even if we ride as fast as we can,

174
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,080
it will take us a day
to catch up with him.

177
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,160
This is the frontier Zhenxi Fortress.

178
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,680
It's the westmost place.

179
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,880
Follow me.

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,240

181
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,280

182
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,440
I don't understand your law or rules,

nor do I want to understand them.

184

But I know

all men, no matter how high or low,

186
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,920
are beasts

188
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,200
It's just that some are domineering

189
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,960
and some are trampled upon.

190
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,560

00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,520
He could be torn into pieces at any time.

195
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,560
It turns out

196
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,520
you have never left.

197
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,000
Han Yongnan,

198
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,120
it serves you right.

199
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,400
Well done.

200
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,480
Think about your sister.

201
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,000
Think about what he has done.

202
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,600
The knife is in your hand.

203
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,520
You can let him

204
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,680
feel your pain.

205
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,440
Don't be afraid.

206
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,640
This is the punishment he deserves.

207
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,120
Wangdong,

208
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,280
kill him.

209
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,680
Kill him!

210
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,280
Wangdong,

211
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,880
kill him!

212
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,400
Kill him!

213
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,560
Stop!

214
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,120
Magistrate, save me!

215
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,720
You came faster than I thought.

216
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,080
He's been in Lanfang County.

217
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,120
He has never left.

218
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,840
Everything

219
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,080
has been arranged by you.

220
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,080
How could it be possible, Daguan?

221
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,960
I just found you

222
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,560
interesting

223
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,360
and was going along for the ride.

224
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,360
Magistrate Di,

225
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,080
do you know?

226
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,720
Han Yongnan has already dug

227
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,040
this place into an illegal mining hole.

228
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,200
If you dig three chi down,

229
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,080
you can dig through the ground.

230
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,000
You don't know it.

231
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,560
Look,

232
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,040
as a magistrate,

233
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,360
you don't even know this.

234
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,160
Wangdong,

235
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,920
put the knife down.

236
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,560
I will punish him for his crime.

237
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,360
Punish him?

238
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,600
Based on what?

239
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,560
Do you have evidence?

240
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,920
He didn't kill anyone.

241
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,520
I killed those two singsong girls.

242
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,680
Wangdong,

243
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,320
put the knife down.

244
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,920
I have found him now.

245
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,920
I'll give him the punishment he deserves.

246
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,800
You can't kill him.

247
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,040
Think about it, Wangdong.

248
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,480
How did he release Han Yongnan?

249
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,360
Do you trust him or yourself?

250
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,720
If you kill him,
you will also commit a crime.

251
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,440
You can take revenge with a knife in hand.

252
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,840
Go to hell!

253
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,800
Wangdong!

254
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,560
Wangdong,

255
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,200
put the knife down.

256
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,800
Han Yongnan will get the punishment
he deserves.

257
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,320
Don't be silly.

258
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,000
Have you always been this stubborn?

259
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,240
I thought

260
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,440
you could be more interesting.

261
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,960
Wangdong,

262
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,350
if you kill him,

263
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,390
you will also become a murderer.

264
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,320
You will also be punished by the law.

265
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,920
You are an official.

266
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,920
You have lots of ways.

267
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,560
Us commoners have no choice.

268
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
Can we just watch our family be killed?

269
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,320
Is it fair?

270
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,800
He is a good man.

271
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,880
He helped me.

272
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,760
Did you hear that?

273
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,880
He needs me. He needs us.

274
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,640
If the government is so indiscriminate,

275
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,280
it's worse than Heiyan.

276
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,920
As long as we joined them,

277
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,360
they would help us get rid of the people

278
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,560
who hurt us.

279
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,840
They are talking nonsense.

280
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,960
Who told you this?

281
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,600
Heiyan is better than you.

282
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,320
Don't listen to him.

283
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,320
He is from Heiyan.

284
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,440
At least, we can give him

285
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,320
justice that you can't give.

286
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,680
Wangdong,

287
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,960
do it now.

288
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,560
You don't have much time.

289
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,160
Magistrate,

290
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,760
help me.

291
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,000
Wangdong.

292
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,800
Magistrate, help me.

293
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,680
Daguan,

294
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,400
do you still want to play?

295
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,680
No more playing, right?

296
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,960
Help!

297
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,600
Help me.

298
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,760
Magistrate.

299
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,680
Help!

300
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,720
I'll kill you!

301
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,800
Wangdong!

302
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,400
Wangdong,

303
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,880
put the knife down.

304
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,720
I'll kill you!

305
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,000
Help me.

306
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,000
I will

307
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,480
kill you.

308
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,240
I'll kill you!

309
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,120
Help me.

310
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,720
Daguan,

311
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,280
do you still want to play?

312
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,760
This time,

313
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,720
you can't play anymore, right?

314
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,800
The last shot.

315
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,760
Let's make it simple.

316
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,840
The law of Tang has been made

317
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,840
for less than a hundred years.

318
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,640
But rage,

319
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:44,880
vengeance,

320
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,480
and ambition

321
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,600
in the human heart

322
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,520
have never changed.

323
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,360
But I'm an official
appointed by the court.

324
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,200
I have to do this.

325
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:25,800
You...

326
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,960
Daguan,

327
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,520
you win.

328
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,040
You are more skilled

329
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,080
in martial arts than me.

330
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,600
But Daguan,

331
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,400
you still lost.

332
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,160
Because your law

333
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,320
is nonsense.

334
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,640
This is Wolf Drug.

335
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,120
If you spread a bottle of this
on the ground,

336
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,440
it can attract all the wolf dogs
within a five-li radius.

337
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,720
Magistrate,

338
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,160
Han Yongnan is beyond recognition
as he was bitten badly.

339
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,000
So miserable.

340
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,440
He is not miserable.

341
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,200
He could die a hundred times

342
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,320
for what he did.

343
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,000
Look at you now.

344
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,120
You got yourself into this

345
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,280
just to stick to the law.

346
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,040
Is it worthwhile?

347
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,400
Stop.

348
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,280
Is it worthwhile?

349
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,560
He is already like this. Don't scold him.

350
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:27,940
[Lanfang County]

351
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,900
[Lanfang County Magistrate's Office]

352
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,000
Huaiying,

353
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,680
why did you exert yourself so much?

354
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,280
If something happened to you,

355
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:41,720
I...

356
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
- How can I explain it to your father?
- I'm still

357
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,520
alive.

358
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,640
You think you are still young.

359
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,600
I'll go get you some medicine.

360
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,040
Don't move.

361
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:25,800
It's okay.

362
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:26,600
I...

363
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,440
It doesn't hurt at all.

364
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,840
I know.

365
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,920
You are right.

366
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,240
Rest well.

367
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,160
Stop.

368
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:18,920
Go.

369
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,160
Magistrate.

370
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,560
Magistrate,

371
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,800
we've investigated it clearly.

372
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,920
We thought the missing villagers
in Liushui Village

373
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,680
and the surrounding areas tried to get rid
of their household registration.

374
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,680
In fact, they became

375
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,000
Han Yongnan's illegal workers.

376
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,680
All of them died in the mine.

377
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,040
We've found

378
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,720
all the corpses.

379
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,480
Han Yongnan engaged in over-exploitation.

380
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,560
The mine has been extended
to the surrounding villages.

381
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,280
The land became barren.

382
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,360
The water has been polluted.

383
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,240
The villagers couldn't make a living.

384
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,720
They could only become illegal workers.

385
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,560
Magistrate,

386
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,800
your persistence

387
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,760
is meaningful.

388
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,480
You are right.

389
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,760
Han Yongnan,

390
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,840
the owner of the silver mine
in Lanfang County,

391
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,760
engaged in over-exploitation

392
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,280
and detention of workers,

393
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,640
resulting in the death of workers.

394
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,640
He was morally bankrupt.

395
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,120
He raped a young girl under age

396
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,640
and was extremely evil.

397
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:18,800
The aim

398
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,320
is to support administration by law.

399
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,200
Violence and adultery are forbidden.

400
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,720
Han Yongnan

401
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,400
is sentenced to death by hanging.

402
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,920
The silver mine in Lanfang County

403
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,520
was prone to mining accidents,

404
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,000
[Sealed
by Lanfang County Magistrate's Office]
which were concealed.

405
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,600
It is ordered to shut down.

406
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,280
The surrounding farmers

407
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,600
will choose new sites

408
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,920
for ploughing.

409
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,480
Return mining to farming.

410
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,040
Ensure the well-being of the people

411
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,600
in accordance with the law.

412
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,520
A life for a life.

413
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,800
Bringing crimes to justice.

414
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,360
No one

415
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,160
is above the law.

416
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:55,800
This

417
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,960
is what the law of Tang insists on.

418
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,000
I know

419
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,700
in Lanfang County,

420
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,840
we are not good enough.

421
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,440
I know

422
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,440
in Lanfang County,

423
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,320
people believe

424
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,640
in the law of the jungle.

425
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,000
We are human,

426
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,120
not wild beasts.

427
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,120
The law of Tang

428
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,320
is to protect

429
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,080
the safety of each and every one of us.

430
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:31,000
We stick to the law of Tang

431
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,200
because

432
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,160
it is the bottom line.

433
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,220
We cannot expect

434
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,020
our vicious dogs

435
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,800
to pounce on the villain this time.

436
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,040
Next time,

437
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,000
who can guarantee

438
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,240
that they won't pounce

439
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,920
on the good of us?

440
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,360
So we have to stick to the law of Tang.

441
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,400
Only it can guarantee

442
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,920
the basic security of each of us.

443
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,220
I know

444
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,840
justice

445
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,390
is what you are longing for.

446
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,980
The law

447
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,100
is the safeguard of justice.

448
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,940
I believe in the law of Tang.

449
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,500
I hope

450
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,020
you

451
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,660
can also believe in me.

452
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,420
I'm willing to believe in you.

453
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,420
I'm willing to believe in you.

454
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,420
We are also willing to believe in you.

455
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,540
Believe in the law of Tang.

456
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,020
We believe in you.

457
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,620
We are willing to believe in you.

458
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,420
Believe in Magistrate.

459
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,060
Believe in Magistrate.

460
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,220
Believe in the law of Tang.

461
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,260
We believe in Magistrate.

462
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,020
We believe in you.

463
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,760
About Han Yongnan's case,

464
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,200
I've submitted a written statement
to His Majesty.

465
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,920
Relevant legal provisions

466
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,520
will be amended.

467
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,280
We have to believe in the law.

468
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,160
Only by believing in the law

469
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,840
can it be

470
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,880
continually amended.

471
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,040
We have to believe in it.

472
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,000
There is power

473
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,400
in believing.
