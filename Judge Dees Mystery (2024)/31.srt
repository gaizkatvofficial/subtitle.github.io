Any resemblance is purely coincidental.]

4
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,180
Come, Huaiying.

5
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,660
Come.

6
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,100
Ying.

7
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,500
Ying.

8
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,340
How is he?

9
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,820
Mr. Li, please

10
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,580
give me a basin of water
and a handkerchief.

11
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,100
I want to lower
the Magistrate's temperature.

12
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,180
Well,

13
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,780
I'll mix him

14
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,340
a stronger dose.

15
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,020
Thank you.

16
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,300
Zhou Li was indeed quite weird lately.

17
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,900
He told me

18
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,260
he had a Heavenly Eye.

19
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,260
He said he could see

20
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,340
unexpected calamities, wronged souls,

21
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,820
anxiety-ridden people,
and spirits behind people's backs.

22
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,980
Can you believe what he said?

23
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,620
Come.

24
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,580
You go over there.

25
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,340
Search that place.

26
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,100
Eaglewood from Yunshui Lodge.

27
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,980
Please give this

28
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,620
to Mr. Cui.

29
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,300
This way, please.

30
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,460
Almost there.

31
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,380
The roads in the library are intricate.

32
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,380
Don't walk around on your own.

33
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,140
It is snowing more and more heavily.

34
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,060
Where can he hide?

35
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,460
Did he find something?

36
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,500
I think so.

37
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,580
Otherwise, how could...?

38
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,420
Who?

39
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:25,900
Who is there?

40
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,260
Did you see someone?

41
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,580
Yes. Chase after him!

42
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,460
Stop.

43
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,180
Stop.

44
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,620
Go over there to take a look.

45
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:52,900
Okay.

46
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,460
Come on, come here.

47
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,380
Okay.

48
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,340
There is no one over there.

49
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,460
No.

50
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,220
There is no one here, either.

51
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,580
I did saw a pair of eyes.

52
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,180
Go over there to search.

53
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:09,740
Where is he?

54
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,140
The roads in the library are intricate.

55
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,380
Don't walk around on your own.

56
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,140
Miss Cao,

57
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,940
I've told you

58
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,980
you can't walk around casually.

59
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,620
What's this place?

60
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,900
What is this place for?

61
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,220
As you can see,

62
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,780
this is an altar.

63
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,900
I'm here to redeem Zhou Li's soul.

64
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,260
Isn't this place a library?

65
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,260
How can there be such a place in it?

66
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,740
We don't worship gods or Buddhas here.

67
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,780
Instead, we pay homage to the dead.

68
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,860
The dead in Zhao Yun Temple.

69
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,220
The dead?

70
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:00,900
Yes.

71
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,500
Two hundred years ago,

72
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,020
this place was a Taoist temple.

73
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,180
Its name was also Zhao Yun.

74
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,340
It was a tumultuous period at that time.

75
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,980
Besides Taoists,

76
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,380
there were a lot of commoners

77
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,420
and scholars here.

78
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,380
One night,

79
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,300
a group of roving bandits
attacked the temple.

80
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,060
In order to get a treasure
that might not exist,

81
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,780
they killed all the Taoists,

82
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,900
commoners,

83
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,060
and scholars here.

84
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,420
That was really a bloody massacre.

85
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,300
Later on,

86
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,100
this place became
a dilapidated and haunted abode.

87
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,500
It had been deserted for a hundred years.

88
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,020
Later,

89
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,700
about 40 years ago,

90
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,180
the world became peaceful.

91
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,420
Our teacher came here by chance.

92
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,420
He renovated this place

93
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,540
and kept the bones

94
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,020
of the dead

95
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,940
in this altar

96
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,340
that had already existed.

97
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,740
[Mr. Zhou Li's Memorial Tablet]

98
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,820
Our teacher also asked us

99
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,300
to bring some offerings here

100
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,500
when there was a climate change

101
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,380
or when it was a festival.

102
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,260
Although we don't perform
a religious rite,

103
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,580
we believe

104
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,020
these offerings

105
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,940
can soothe the souls of the dead.

106
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,220
I see.

107
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,420
Miss Cao,

108
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,980
why are you here?

109
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,180
Does Mr. Cui

110
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,100
know

111
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,300
the death of Zhou Li?

112
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,020
When our teacher's retreat

113
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,860
is over,

114
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,020
I'll report to him about it.

115
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,020
I didn't mean to offend this place.

116
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,180
I saw

117
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,260
the students in the library
were all very busy.

118
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,380
I didn't know what had happened.

119
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,020
So I came out to take a look.

120
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,900
However, I got lost.

121
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,100
They were looking for

122
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,340
the child in white

123
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,180
the Magistrate mentioned.

124
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,620
Have they found him?

125
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,900
Following the direction
the Magistrate told us,

126
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,580
they searched the entire yard.

127
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,540
But they didn't find the child.

128
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,900
Well,

129
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,540
the Magistrate was hurt
by poisonous thorns.

130
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,940
Was it possible

131
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,420
that he was hallucinating?

132
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,860
I don't think

133
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,460
the Magistrate was hallucinating.

134
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,220
Instead, he saw a ghost.

135
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,220
Or the Magistrate

136
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,100
saw something

137
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,900
that did not exist

138
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,100
because of the foul aura of the dead.

139
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,180
Do you know there will be
a solar eclipse this month?

140
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,420
On such dismal days,

141
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,420
the dead here

142
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,500
are always restless.

143
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,140
I don't believe in such things.

144
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,380
At first, I didn't believe
in these things, either.

145
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,580
But our teacher believes in them.

146
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,660
He showed me

147
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,620
that our understanding of the world

148
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,820
may be only

149
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,060
one ten-thousandth
of the truth of the world.

150
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:30,340
One day, there will be an explanation

151
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,900
for those unknown things

152
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,860
like ghosts, gods, and Buddhas.

153
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,420
Now we can only

154
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,660
understand it simply as a magnetic field.

155
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,020
As the weather has changed,

156
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,460
Yin Qi in this place is very heavy.

157
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,100
Plus the Magistrate

158
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,420
was very weak.

159
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,500
So his magnetic field might
have been disturbed,

160
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,580
causing the instability of his mind.

161
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,780
The old wishes

162
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,300
in his heart

163
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,820
were projected

164
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,060
into the air.

165
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,460
We can also call them

166
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,420
obsessions.

167
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,340
An obsession

168
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,660
may concern

169
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,660
something happened long ago

170
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,580
or

171
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,580
a deceased person.

172
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:18,980
Miss Cao.

173
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:20,620
Miss Cao.

174
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,740
Do you also have obsessions

175
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,460
in your heart like the Magistrate?

176
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,580
The Yin Qi here is too heavy.

177
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,180
We'd better leave quickly.

178
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,740
Hurry up.

179
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,900
Stop.

180
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,330
Stop!

181
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,050
Put it down.

182
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,260
What happened?

183
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,660
Magistrate,

184
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,100
last night,

185
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,340
Zhou Li

186
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,900
jumped down from the rooftop and died.

187
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,420
Everybody witnessed it.

188
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,300
Miss Cao was also here.

189
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,500
Why did he jump down from the rooftop?

190
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,740
Last night,

191
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,660
we gave Miss Cao an account.

192
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,660
Huaiying,

193
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,300
you are awake.

194
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,340
Mr. Li.

195
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,780
How are you now?

196
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,140
I'm feeling better.

197
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,100
Great.

198
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,660
It seems that the prescription

199
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,900
is working.

200
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,700
What happened in the library?

201
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,140
Why did he

202
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,340
jump down from the rooftop?

203
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,540
Miss Cao already

204
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,300
knows something about it.

205
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,580
It's too cold outside.

206
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,420
Let's go back to the room and talk.

207
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,700
Magistrate, please.

208
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,140
Let's go.

209
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,940
Don't catch a cold.

210
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:09,980
Please.

211
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,620
I saw him writing it on his palm

212
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,980
before he jumped down.

213
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,060
[Ghost]

214
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,220
Maybe he wanted to tell you something.

215
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,100
I don't know.

216
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,660
It seemed he wanted to say something,

217
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,860
but he didn't say anything.

218
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,700
Before he jumped down, he looked back.

219
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,780
His eyes were filled with horror

220
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,700
as if he had seen a ghost.

221
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,140
Are you sure those footprints

222
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,900
led from this room to the yard last night?

223
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,540
That's right.

224
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,620
Each footprint was about this big.

225
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,340
Each one was very deep.

226
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,380
The man seemed to be very heavy.

227
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,860
The incense that was given to Mr. Cui

228
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,620
appeared at the door
for no apparent reason.

229
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,020
And what I saw in the underground hall.

230
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,420
We don't worship gods or Buddhas here.

231
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,060
Instead, we pay homage to the dead
in Zhao Yun Temple.

232
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,660
Everything was so weird.

233
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,980
When it stops snowing,

234
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,740
let's leave here quickly.

235
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,900
When will the snow stop?

236
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,100
We can't leave now.

237
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,220
Yeah.

238
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,700
What I want to say is

239
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,700
that there are too many mysteries
we haven't solved.

240
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,820
Possessed by the dead,

241
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,100
Zhou Li jumped down and died.

242
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,420
They pay homage to the dead

243
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,820
200 years ago in the underground hall.

244
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,900
The package of incense

245
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,260
was back here for no apparent reason.

246
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,340
I saw

247
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,740
that child in white again.

248
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,340
Where did you see him?

249
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,900
Do you know there will be
a solar eclipse this month?

250
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,260
On such dismal days,

251
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,220
the dead here

252
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,220
are always restless.

253
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,300
As the weather has changed,

254
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,060
Yin Qi in this place is very heavy.

255
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,700
Plus the Magistrate is weak.

256
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,180
So his magnetic field might
have been disturbed,

257
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,660
causing the instability of his mind.

258
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,980
Ever since I came here,

259
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,100
I've been having a strange feeling.

260
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,180
It seems a pair of eyes are watching me.

261
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,740
The solar eclipse is coming.

262
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,020
Let's not offend the dead.

263
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,660
No, that's not the dead.

264
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,460
I know what I saw.

265
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,780
Maybe

266
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,260
it was really because you were too weak.

267
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,100
Or maybe you just saw

268
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,940
your own obsession.

269
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,460
The dead won't disturb the living.

270
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,340
Maybe you haven't forgotten him.

271
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,180
But I won't let him

272
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,500
disturb me.

273
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,500
Miss Cao, here is the medicine.

274
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:43,860
Mr. Li.

275
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,620
Miss Cao,

276
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,660
this is the Magistrate's medicine.

277
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,540
After he takes it today,

278
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:52,860
he should

279
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,860
get better tomorrow.

280
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,020
Thank you.

281
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,740
We also want

282
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,180
to leave the library as soon as possible.

283
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,820
Okay.

284
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,540
Well,

285
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,620
when it stops snowing,

286
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,940
I'll ask someone to send you
down the mountain at once.

287
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,980
Thank you.

288
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,980
Give it to the Magistrate now.

289
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,220
Goodbye.

290
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,940
The medicine Mr. Li has sent here.

291
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,700
Take it when it's hot.

292
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,860
When it stops snowing,

293
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,540
you can go back first.

294
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,020
It is written
in "Records of the Supernatural"

295
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,100
that there is a rare spring
south of Lanfang County.

296
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,060
Scoop a goblet of spring water

297
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,460
and the heart will be reborn.

298
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,420
One can realize

299
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,780
one's wish.

300
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,300
Scoop a goblet of spring water

301
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,940
and there is nothing to worry about?

302
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,820
When you come back,

303
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,180
if you still keep calling me Miss Cao,

304
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,700
I won't respond.

305
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,940
Our library does not teach children.

306
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,380
A year ago, when our teacher
started to retreat,

307
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,300
he left only his close disciples
in the library.

308
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,180
Moreover,

309
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,100
they are all adults.

310
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,580
He was acting weird lately.

311
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,460
He always said

312
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,420
he was agitated.

313
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,260
He also said someone was watching him.

314
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,580
[Nightmare, Soul, Spirit]

315
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,820
[Ghost]

316
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,860
Are you sure those footprints

317
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,500
led from this room to the yard last night?

318
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,900
Each footprint was about this big.

319
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,660
Each one was very deep.

320
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,940
The man seemed to be very heavy.

321
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,140
Before he jumped down, he looked back.

322
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,020
His eyes were filled with horror

323
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,980
as if he had seen a ghost.

324
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,500
This way, please.

325
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,220
Mr. Cui.

326
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,300
Mr. Cui.

327
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,420
In order to write smoothly

328
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,100
and understand the historical facts,

329
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,500
every time after reading
historical materials,

330
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,900
our teacher will be in retreat.

331
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,780
Not to disturb him during his retreat.

332
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,340
Otherwise, his previous efforts
would be wasted.

333
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,060
So he should be burning the sandalwood

334
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,220
to calm his mind.

335
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,260
Hurry up.

336
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,340
If we sent it too late,
we will get scolded again.

337
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,340
Okay.

338
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,500
Hurry up.

339
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,380
Okay.

340
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,140
It's snowing so heavily.

341
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,700
Don't know when it will stop.

342
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,660
Who knows?

343
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,820
Possessed by the dead,

344
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,820
Zhou Li jumped down and died.

345
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,420
I saw

346
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,100
that child in white again.

347
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,060
The package of incense

348
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,780
was back here for no apparent reason.

349
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,740
They pay homage to the dead

350
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,380
200 years ago in the underground hall.

351
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,020
There are too many mysteries
we haven't solved.

352
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,980
[Loving Father Pei Shinian's Tomb]
The dead won't disturb the living.

353
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,100
I won't let him

354
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,300
disturb me.

355
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,060
Who?

356
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,580
Stop.

357
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:11,820
Kid.

358
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,340
Where is my sword?

359
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,220
It's time to give it back to me.

360
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,620
The sword is with me.

361
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,380
He has given it back to me.

362
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,860
My brother.

363
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:54,980
Maybe

364
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,780
it was really because you were too weak.

365
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,340
Or maybe you just saw

366
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,300
your own obsession.

367
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:25,900
Who?

368
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,100
Lighter.

369
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,020
Huaiying.

370
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,700
Slowly.

371
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,100
Miss Cao.

372
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,380
What happened?

373
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,940
The Magistrate passed out
in the underground hall.

374
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,180
I guess

375
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,900
after he heard you describe that place,

376
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,300
he wanted to explore it himself.

377
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,380
But with his health condition,

378
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,660
it's too dangerous for him to go there.

379
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,620
You can leave.

380
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,300
Yes.

381
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,860
But his fever has gone down.

382
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:45,980
Why

383
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,580
is he still in a coma?

384
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,660
Did he take the medicine

385
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,940
I decocted for him?

386
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,940
I accidentally knocked it over.

387
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,300
It doesn't matter.

388
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,140
I'll prepare

389
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,340
another dose for him.

390
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,340
Thank you.

391
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,100
Don't go.

392
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,660
The wooden sword.

393
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:26,820
Huaiying,

394
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:28,980
what did you see?

395
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,100
The wooden sword.

396
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:33,980
The wooden sword.

397
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,340
