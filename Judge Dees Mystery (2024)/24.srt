In case a real fight breaks out,

we have the advantage of more men.

46
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:40,920

Most likely.

a very beautiful red dress,

that she would take me to the capital
to learn singing

94

00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,320
you would think

196
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,880
they committed adultery.

197
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,760
You killed them

198
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,920
and took that man's property.

199
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,120
Is that true?

200
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,320
Wei,

201
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,120
please go out

202
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,960
and get some fresh air.

203
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:40,800
No.

204
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,760
I want to hear this.

205
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,000
Magistrate,

206
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,160
you wronged me.

207
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,760
All of this is your imagination.

208
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,120
Evidence.

209
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,560
Where is your evidence?

210
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,360
You don't have it.

211
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,920
These

212
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,720
are your wife's belongings.

213
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,120
The biggest flaw in your murder

214
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,280
is that you didn't burn them.

215
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,880
You're too greedy for money.

216
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,640
You keep everything

217
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,720
left behind by travelers

218
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,560
coming and going.

219
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,880
You even wanted

220
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,200
to sell them to me.

221
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,560
Let me take you to see something good.

222
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,440
You have good taste, Healer Lin.

223
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,440
It's just a bit expensive.

224
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,240
You have never

225
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,360
regarded her as your wife.

226
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,240
So you never know

227
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,680
how much she loved this

228
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,080
red dress.

229
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:46,880
No.

230
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,640
You said she eloped with another man.

231
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,560
But why didn't she

232
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,440
take her favorite dress with her?

233
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,760
That seems unreasonable.

234
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,400
Also,

235
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,760
the robe I'm wearing

236
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,360
belonged to that man.

237
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,360
Wei can testify to that.

238
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,680
This robe seems to belong to that guest.

239
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,560
You are so greedy

240
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,840
that you even took

241
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,560
a dead man's clothes

242
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,240
and sold them.

243
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,520
The corpses

244
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,920
were tossed out into the wilds by you.

245
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,560
I'm afraid I can't find them.

246
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,400
But as for the place

247
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,840
where you hid them,

248
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,960
I can make it clear to you.

249
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,200
Mr. Lang,

250
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,760
the two corpses were hidden

251
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,040
in your warehouse.

252
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,760
I'm afraid

253
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,600
you didn't know about that.

254
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,800
In my warehouse?

255
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,440
Those two corpses

256
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,760
were hidden in my warehouse?

257
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,360
Wei Sheng,

258
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,600
you were afraid of being caught

259
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,520
transporting the bodies out of the inn.

260
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,840
So, you took the corpses

261
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,160
to Mr. Lang's warehouse
and dismembered them

262
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,640
with the aim to dispose of them.

263
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,120
Until last night,

264
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,520
I came here

265
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,680
and ruined your plan.

266
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,080
Mr. Wei,

267
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,280
where did you go driving a carriage
in the middle of the night?

268
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,000
Healer Lin.

269
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,480
This was

270
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,280
made for me by my mother.

271
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,040
If it weren't this immoral woman,

272
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,800
how could I...?

273
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,800
Have you made up your mind?

274
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,200
Come with me.

275
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,480
Please don't do that.

276
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,880
How is it? Is it delicious?

277
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,600
She always looked down on me,

278
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,520
and she often flirted with guests.

279
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,200
You are right.

280
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,600
I killed her.

281
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,160
They deserved it.

282
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,080
They deserved it.

283
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,200
You animal!

284
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,480
Give me back my mother!

285
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,240
You...

286
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,560
Kill them!

287
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,520
They were both killed by me.

288
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,880
Give me back my mother!

289
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,320
You animal!

290
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,600
Take him away.

291
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,440
Animal!

292
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,700
[Green Bird Inn]

293
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,960
Magistrate Di,

294
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,360
you truly live up to your reputation.

295
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,600
I have told you

296
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,400
that the Chief always plans carefully.

297
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,360
Magistrate Di,

298
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,880
please give me the thing.

299
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,160
What thing?

300
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,040
Our Chief said

301
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,200
that Heiyan's messenger disappeared
mysteriously.

302
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,480
As long as the case was given to you,

303
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,280
you would find out the reasons behind it.

304
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,000
I doubted it before.

305
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,080
But now it seems that

306
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,760
our Chief

307
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,640
does foretell things accurately.

308
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,520
You are from Heiyan.

309
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,200
Magistrate Di,

310
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,720
thanks a lot

311
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,080
for this case.

312
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,560
Mr. Lang,

313
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,760
can you

314
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,960
speak more clearly?

315
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:11,720
Sure.

316
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,760
More than ten days ago,

317
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,640
our messenger

318
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,440
compiled a new roster

319
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,200
of the members in Lanfang County

320
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,640
and was to give it to our Chief.

321
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,400
Unexpectedly,

322
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,200
when he passed by Qingchuan,

323
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,000
he

324
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,080
disappeared mysteriously.

325
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,440
I came here

326
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,520
with the aim of seeking the reason.

327
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,880
But our Chief said

328
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,960
the quickest way to find out the reason

329
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,760
was to give this case to you.

330
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,280
Am I

331
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,720
clear enough?

332
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,160
Magistrate Di,

333
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,440
let's be straightforward.

334
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,760
Give me

335
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,440
the roster.

336
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,520
What roster?

337
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,880
I truly

338
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,760
don't know.

339
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,560
Magistrate Di,

340
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,000
have you ever heard

341
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,110
a nursery rhyme?

342
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,680
Boqi.

343
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,200
Boqi

344
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,600
eats nightmares at night.

345
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,840
This world

346
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,480
is just a nightmare.

347
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,080
Heiyan, however,

348
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,640
exterminates nightmares.

349
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,600
Nightmares are gone,

350
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,680
and welfare comes.

351
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,800
Heiyan's

352
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,280
roster of Lanfang County.

353
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,240
It seems that Heiyan

354
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,400
wants to stage a comeback.

355
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,320
Thank you

356
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,960
for helping Heiyan fulfill its dream
in Qingchuan.

357
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,200
Where is

358
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,880
that roster?

359
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,120
Magistrate Di.

360
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,600
Di Renjie.

361
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,640
You are unmatched in intelligence.

362
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,000
Please don't joke with me.

363
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,320
You have found the messenger,

364
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,240
so the roster is surely in your hands.

365
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,000
Be sensible

366
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,520
and give it to me.

367
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,000
Di Renjie,

368
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,920
our Chief

369
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,000
didn't say we should take your life.

370
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,280
But the Chief

371
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,920
didn't say we should not
take your life, either.

372
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,360
So, the man killed by Wei Sheng

373
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,840
was the messenger of Heiyan.

374
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,120
So,

375
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,560
he invited me to Qingchuan

376
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,880
because he wanted to use me

377
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,040
to investigate the case

378
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,040
that your messenger lost the roster

379
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,040
of Lanfang County.

380
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,920
Yun Tian.

381
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,600
Okay.

382
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,520
What's going on?

383
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,240
Attack!

384
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,880
It seems that your reinforcements

385
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,400
won't be able to come.

386
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,400
His reinforcements.

387
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,200
You would always be a good official,

388
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,160
won't you?

389
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,640
Okay.

390
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,200
I got it.

391
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,320
In such a world,

392
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,200
people like him

393
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,920
are rare these days.

394
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,760
What...

395
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,920
I have paid you.

396
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:23,840
Such a person

397
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,280
is so shameless!

398
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,320
Shameless!

399
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,160
Yanzhou rock oil!
[*Ancient oil]

400
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,120
Healer Lin,

401
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,840
you really know a lot.

402
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,720
Since you know this thing,

403
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,760
you must know my determination

404
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,800
of getting the roster.

405
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Give it to me.

406
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,720
The way of great learning

407
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,680
consists in manifesting
one's bright virtue

408
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,200
and loving the people.

409
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,280
But can manifesting one's bright virtue

410
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,920
change such a world?

411
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,560
Can loving people ensure
everyone eats his fill?

412
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,440
I

413
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,800
have read all the pre-Qin classics,

414
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,360
but I am still confused.

415
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,280
Then, I met the Chief.

416
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,480
He made me understand

417
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,520
that all things in this world

418
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,560
were born and nurtured by nature.

419
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,120
They follow the way
of mutual generation and restriction.

420
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,120
Their ultimate goal is just to live.

421
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,880
In order to live,

422
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,840
we can't be trapped by kindness.

423
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,160
Then, why is it

424
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,080
up to you

425
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,720
whether a person should live or die?

426
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,600
Anyway,

427
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,640
the roster

428
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,280
can't be handed to the imperial court.

429
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,920
If you insist on keeping it,

430
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,480
I will choose to die

431
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,320
with you.

432
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,720
Naughty!

433
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,800
Be careful of the fire!

434
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,400
Di Renjie.

435
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,960
Di Renjie.

436
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,080
You

437
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,200
insist

438
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,160
on the benevolence.

439
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,920
But in my eyes,

440
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,880
that is stupid.

441
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,040
Sorry.

442
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,720
It's not my fault...

443
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,840
He is so weak.

444
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,200
You can't save a man

445
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,680
who wants to die.

446
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,440
I put the water here.

447
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,640
The meal is ready.

448
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,960
Please go and have some.

449
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:53,760
Okay.

450
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,440
Also,

451
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,920
I have finished transcribing
the document sent here yesterday

452
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,720
by the state government,
and I put it in the study.

453
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,400
Please give it
to the Magistrate Assistant later

454
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,120
and don't delay the official duties.

455
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,880
Okay, sure.

456
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,640
I'll buy some medicine for Qiao Tai.

457
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,320
When I'm not with you,

458
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,400
you should take care of yourself.

459
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,600
Don't worry.

460
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,040
I'm also bewitched by her.

461
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,200
Let me ask you a question.

462
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,480
As for the roster,

463
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,840
what do you

464
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,000
plan to do with it?

465
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,040
Who are you

466
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,040
exactly?

467
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,160
I am just

468
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:58,600
a passer-by.

469
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,840
I simply find you agreeable,

470
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,320
so I decided to help you.

471
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,720
Is there anything wrong with that?

472
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,480
Fine.

473
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,320
You are just a passer-by.

474
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,920
I am

475
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,920
an official appointed by the court.

476
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,280
Now,

477
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,600
I finally got Heiyan's roster.

478
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,920
I should bring it back

479
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,520
and give it to the court.

480
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,280
It should be handled

481
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,600
according to the Tang Code.

482
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,840
What's next?

483
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,560
Next?

484
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,600
The army marches here

485
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,200
and kills

486
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,120
all of the common populace

487
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,080
listed on the roster.

488
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,440
Common populace?

489
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,960
Exactly.

490
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,040
In the past,

491
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,200
the influence of Heiyan covered
Lanfang County.

492
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,880
Many of the local populace

493
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,440
chose to join it,

494
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,000
or they had relatives who joined it.

495
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,040
Heiyan wrote all of their names

496
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,600
into the roster.

497
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,960
As for the people on the roster,

498
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,040
few of them knew

499
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,150
what Heiyan was

500
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,360
and what Heiyan was going to do.

501
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,320
They had no choice.

502
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,600
They only submitted a petition.

503
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,670
What is their crime?

504
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,230
What do you mean?

505
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,150
A long time ago,

506
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,760
Confucius

507
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,150
passed by Pu to reach the Wei state.

508
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,360
But he was attacked by the Pu people.

509
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,150
So, he signed a covenant with them,

510
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,400
saying that he wouldn't go to Wei state.

511
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,670
But thereafter,

512
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,800
Confucius still went to Wei state.

513
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,800
Zigong was confused by this.
[*One of Confucius' disciples]

514
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,320
He thought that

515
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,880
in his heart,

516
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,440
Confucius was always righteous and honest.

517
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,400
How could he go back on his own words?

518
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,840
So, Zigong went to ask Confucius.

519
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,280
Confucius said

520
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,200
that a covenant

521
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,560
signed under duress

522
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,720
wouldn't be approved

523
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,840
by Heaven.

524
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,960
You want me

525
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,000
to spare those people on the roster?

526
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,080
Those stubborn people

527
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,280
should surely be eradicated.

528
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,640
But for those who don't know the case,

529
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,360
even Heaven

530
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,800
won't blame them.

531
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,160
In this place,

532
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,760
everyone could be from Heiyan.

533
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,400
He is from Heiyan.

534
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,160
I could also come from Heiyan.

535
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,920
Mr. Wei could also be from Heiyan.

536
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,720
But Mr. Wei

537
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,560
was guilty of murder,
not of being from Heiyan.

538
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,200
Even that little girl's mother

539
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,360
could be from Heiyan.

540
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,320
How is that possible?

541
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,720
How is that impossible?

542
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,720
Do you know how Heiyan

543
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,840
managed to recruit

544
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,880
these people?

545
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,200
It's nothing more

546
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,880
than coercion and temptation.

547
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,160
Right!

548
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,320
Coercion and temptation.

549
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,840
In Lanfang County,

550
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,520
in Qingchuan Town,

551
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,320
there is no order.

552
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,920
How can an ordinary man

553
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,600
withstand their

554
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,760
coercion and temptation?

555
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:17,800
If

556
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,400
you hand the roster

557
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,560
to the court,

558
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,040
when the army marches here,

559
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,560
lots of people will die.

560
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,120
Do

561
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,560
all the people listed in this roster

562
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,440
deserve to die?

563
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,640
Do

564
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,160
they deserve to die

565
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,640
in your hands?

566
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:18,260
[Herbal Shop]

567
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,000
Here is your medicine. Please take it.

568
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,160
Thank you.

569
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,680
Take care.
