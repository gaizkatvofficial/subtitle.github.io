But they left without permission.

After we arrived,

55
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,640
the military camp
was fairly well-supplied.

56

But it is clearly
a dilapidated military camp.

with these procurement approvals alone,

66
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,440

against them.

193
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,640
self-esteem.

194
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,080
This matter has not been cleared up yet.

195
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,080
I'd rather they are bodies with dignity.

196
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,760
Magistrate,

197
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,440
leave here

198
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,600
with your men.

199
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,080
This is my military camp.

200
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,320
I have the final say.

201
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,040
It's not a big deal.

202
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,560
Don't be anxious.

203
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,400
I'll get someone to restring it.

204
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,680
No need.

205
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,040
Shall I

206
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,040
invite Magistrate Di to come?

207
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,640
No need.

208
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,040
I don't quite understand.

209
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,720
You are clearly

210
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,200
worried about him.

211
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,360
You know his heart from someone else.

212
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,440
Why are you unwilling to see him?

213
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,720
Recklessly following someone

214
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,600
to a strange place

215
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,080
and unfamiliar surroundings

216
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,200
does not necessarily
lead to a good ending.

217
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,960
That's not necessarily true.

218
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,000
Life is

219
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,120
unpredictable.

220
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,120
You may encounter

221
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,760
anything.

222
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,200
Maybe every disaster
you've ever experienced

223
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,120
can teach you something.

224
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,080
You are either sad

225
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,280
or joyful.

226
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,720
A distant place

227
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,120
actually has nothing.

228
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,560
A distant place

229
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,320
may not necessarily have nothing.

230
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,920
Magistrate

231
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,240
will leave Penglai very soon

232
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,600
and go to work in Lanfang County.

233
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,480
He wants to invite you to go with him.

234
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,400
Nobody knows

235
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,880
when he will invite you himself.

236
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,600
Do you know it will take a tree

237
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,960
at least three to four years

238
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,400
to bear fruits?

239
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,240
But it will bear fruits in the end, right?

240
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,920
I'm here.

241
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,040
I didn't break my word.

242
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,040
I'm back.

243
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,360
When I was little, I caught a cricket.

244
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,080
It was during the Dragon Boat Festival.

245
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,320
It was right in the grass
in the backyard of my house.

246
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,560
The little creature

247
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,800
kept chirping.

248
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,160
It seemed

249
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,760
it had endless energy.

250
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,120
It was very pleasant to hear.

251
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,480
It seemed the chirping

252
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,240
would never stop.

253
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,360
But just after the seventh month
of the year,

254
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,520
it died.

255
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,520
I cried very hard.

256
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,600
Later on, every year,

257
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,840
I would catch a cricket.

258
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,560
It was as if

259
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,320
they made a deal.

260
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,640
As soon as summer was over,

261
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,160
all of them were dead.

262
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,200
I can't remember

263
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,160
what year

264
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,200
I haven't cried since.

265
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Later on,

266
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,840
no matter what kind of creature died,

267
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,240
I never shed

268
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,280
a single drop of tear.

269
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,320
I can't save anyone!

270
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,480
I can't save anyone.

271
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,800
Magistrate, you are awake.

272
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,360
Miss Cao prepared tea for you

273
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,680
as well as water from the well.

274
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,600
She...

275
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,200
She is gone.

276
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,760
She asked me to take good care of you.

277
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,360
She asked me to tell you

278
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,080
to go back after having tea.

279
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,760
She will come back quite late.

280
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,420
[Penglai County Magistrate's Office]

281
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,400
Magistrate,

282
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,840
The Esteemed Head has found out

283
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,400
where the four soldiers went
that night.

284
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,600
How could it be this tavern?

285
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,640
This is the tavern

286
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,600
where some people caused
a disturbance that night.

287
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:37,920
This...

288
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,200
Can you still recognize us?

289
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,280
Gentlemen, it was a misunderstanding

290
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,920
last time.

291
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,680
The Esteemed Head
has given me instructions.

292
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,760
He asked me to serve you well.

293
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,960
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask.

294
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,080
Everyone, please.

295
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,680
Please.

296
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,600
Please, be careful.

297
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,160
Magistrate,

298
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,880
it was these brats

299
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,440
who nearly smashed my tavern.

300
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,640
When did they come?

301
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,840
At dusk.

302
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,200
Did they take knives with them?

303
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,520
No.

304
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,360
If they had brought knives,

305
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,920
I would definitely remember it clearly.

306
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,040
What else

307
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,600
has left you a deep impression?

308
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,840
At dusk,

309
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,560
besides those brats,

310
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,720
in the private room on the second floor,

311
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,120
there were another two guests drinking.

312
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,200
I know one of them.

313
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,040
Mr. Xie from the salt shop.

314
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,320
The other one

315
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,000
was unfamiliar.

316
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,640
He has a mustache.

317
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,320
Previously...

318
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,640
Talk about these children.

319
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,440
Those brats were drunk.

320
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,840
They started to create
a disturbance here.

321
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,560
First, they overturned the table.

322
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,320
Then they caught me

323
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,560
and were about to beat me
without a reason.

324
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,760
At this time,

325
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,440
Mr. Xie and the man with a mustache

326
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,520
finished drinking on the second floor.

327
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,680
They were walking downstairs.

328
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,600
They directly encountered those brats.

329
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,640
When those brats

330
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,720
saw the man with a mustache,

331
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,040
they looked as if they saw a ghost.

332
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,720
In the end, they were taken away
directly by the man with a mustache.

333
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,120
Did the man with a mustache

334
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,080
behave like a soldier?

335
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,640
If you say so,

336
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,920
he indeed looked like a soldier.

337
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,020
[Xie's Salt Shop]

338
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,080
It turns out that those child soldiers
went out to drink secretly.

339
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,000
They bumped into Officer Li.

340
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,400
That's not right.

341
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,960
When we were in the military camp,

342
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,000
Officer Li said he had been

343
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,160
interrogating those child soldiers
about their whereabouts.

344
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,480
And nothing
came out of the interrogation.

345
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,280
But according to the owner
of the tavern,

346
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,720
it was he who had caught them back.

347
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,800
Officer Li was lying.

348
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,880
Why did he lie about this?

349
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,480
Why didn't he tell us directly?

350
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,240
Because he can't let others know

351
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,720
whom he met

352
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,640

Magistrate, they came out.

355
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,960
No wonder the military camp
is so dilapidated.

356
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,120
It turns out the things are hidden here.

357
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,200

00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,640
Magistrate.

383
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,080
Tai.

384
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,200
Tai.

385
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,040
Let go of me!

386
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,440
Let go of me!

387
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,880
Creating a disturbance
in the military camp.

388
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,080
Take her to the dungeon!

389
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:14,960
Yes.

390
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,360
Go!

391
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:15,960
Let go of me!

392
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,480
Let go of me!

393
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,480
Tai!

394
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,480
Magistrate!

395
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:19,880
Go!

396
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,960
If you hadn't revealed yourself
during the registration,

397
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,120
I couldn't have remembered

398
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,560
I saw you at Assault-resisting Garrison
in Youzhou, Hebei Circuit.

399
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,720
[Qiao Tai]
As a deserter,

400
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,040
you dared

401
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,880
to frequent the military camp
swaggeringly?

402
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,760
You are so bold.

403
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,160
Do you remember Vice Commandant Luan?

404
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,600
He was my friend.

405
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,440
Magistrate,

406
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,400
I'll have a good talk with you later.

407
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,800
Take Magistrate Di to have a rest.

408
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,080
Tai.

409
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:11,720
Tai.

410
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:12,920
Tai.

411
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,000
Tai.

412
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,600
Tai.

413
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,600
Tai...

414
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,040
Tai.

415
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,440
Is he dead?

416
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,160
Is he dead?

417
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,480
Did you kill him?

418
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,600
Tai!

419
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,760
Is he dead?

420
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,880
Tai,

421
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,280
are you dead?

422
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,800
Tai!

423
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:35,960
Tai!

424
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,360
Don't touch me.

425
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,440
Tai?

426
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,160
Tai?

427
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,040
It hurts.

428
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,520
You scared me to death.

429
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,960
Tai.

430
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:57,800
Tai.

431
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,440
I got Magistrate into trouble.

432
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,760
He is not afraid of trouble.

433
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,400
All these years,

434
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,280
I had few chances to write my name.

435
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,240
I came to this military camp

436
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,000
and saw these soldiers.

437
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,600
How could I unconsciously...?

438
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,680
I was...

439
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,080
What are you capable of?

440
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,400
If you were really capable,

441
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,240
how could you have been beaten so badly?

442
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,320
Stop talking.

443
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,440
Let me speak.

444
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,280
Tell my words to Magistrate.

445
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,760
You go out and tell him yourself.

446
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,520
It's too late.

447
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,200
If they convict me of desertion,

448
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,960
I still think it's worth it.

449
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,440
My true name

450
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,280
is Guo Kui.

451
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,360
I was a decurion

452
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,800
under General Meng

453
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,320
in Assault-resisting Garrison

454
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,760
in Youzhou, Hebei Circuit.

455
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,960
At that time,

456
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,480
the war between the Tang

457
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,720
and the vassals were raging.

458
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,480
Everyone knew

459
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,880
that going to the battlefield

460
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,240
meant death.

461
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,480
It was just a matter of time.

462
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,800
One day, after training,

463
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,720
I heard a woman's laughter.

464
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,000
The laughter suddenly gave me

465
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,000
something to look forward to

466
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,000
while I was waiting to die.

467
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,800
She smiled at me.

468
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,760
She was our Vice Commandant's concubine.

469
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,200
She said she liked me.

470
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,240
She asked me to take her away.

471
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,360
Then I became a deserter.

472
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,560
What happened after that?

473
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,280
On the third day we were away
from the camp, she couldn't bear it.

474
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,520
Quick.

475
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,360
- What's wrong?
- I'm...

476
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,600
I'm done.

477
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,640
It's been three days.

478
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,000
I can't stand

479
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,760
this constant worrying and fear anymore.

480
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,520
I couldn't watch her suffer.

481
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,000
So I sent her back.

482
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,800
You say it's worth it?

483
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,920
She was

484
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,080
in a relationship with me.

485
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,640
Go to hell.

486
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,200
It hurts.

487
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,920
Tell Magistrate

488
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,280
he was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

489
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,920
Kill him!

490
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,000
Kill him!

491
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,080
Kill the deserter!

492
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,640
Deserter!

493
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,200
Let me go out!

494
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,960
Kill him!

495
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,680
Deserter!

496
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,760
Kill him!

497
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,560
Deserter!

498
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,360
Deserter!

499
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,360
Kill him!

500
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,080
Deserter!

501
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,280
Qiao Tai!

502
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,400
Qiao Tai!

503
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,680
Kill him!

504
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,000
Qiao Tai!

505
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,440
Kill him!

506
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,400
Kill him!

507
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,160
Kill him!

508
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,000
Kill him!

509
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,200
Kill him!

510
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,600
Kill him!

511
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,720
Kill him!

512
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,720
Kill him!

513
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,400
Kill the deserter!

514
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,240
Kill him!

515
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,880
Deserter!

516
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,320
Any last words from the sinner?

517
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,560
See?

518
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,160
This is what happens to deserters.

519
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,040
Got cold feet and escaped.

520
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,120
The one should be sentenced to death.

521
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,640
Now let's

522
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,640
send him to hell.

523
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,200
Kill him!

524
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,360
Deserter!

525
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:41,960
Kill him!

526
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,920
Deserter!

527
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,520
Kill him!

528
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,480
Kill him!

529
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,040
Deserter!

530
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,640
Kill him!

531
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,920
Because he can't let others know

532
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,320
whom he met

533
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,160
or what they talked about

534
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,000
that night.

535
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,120
No. 301A

536
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,480
Procurement Application.

537
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,120
600 jin of mutton.

538
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,160
No. 302A

539
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,280
Procurement Application.

540
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,080
300 jin of cast iron

541
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,560
for casting armor and shields.

542
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:17,880
No. 303A

543
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,400
Procurement Application.

544
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,520
1,000 ropes

545
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,280
used for...

546
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,240
Why are you looking at me?

547
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,080
...used for climbing.

548
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,760
He is lying.

549
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,200
He is as much a worm

550
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,520
as any official sent before.

551
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,240
He just wants to save his subordinate.

552
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,600
Guards,

553
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,360
go kill him!

554
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,480
Wait a minute.

555
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,120
Let him finish.

556
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,080
Want to rebel?

557
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,280
But where are these materials?

558
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,840
At this moment,

559
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,640
they are

560
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:47,840
in the warehouse of Xie's Salt Shop

561
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,040
in the east of the city.

562
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,040
If such a worm is not removed,

563
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:59,320
Tang soldiers will lose their dignity.

564
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,840
Nonsense!

565
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,800
It's all lies from these stupid officials.

566
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,920
Go kill him quickly!

567
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,600
Put away the saber.

568
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,000
- Go kill him!
- Put away!

569
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:09,860
Who is it?

570
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,000
Who is it?

571
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,680
Listen, everyone.

572
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,160
Officer Li colluded
with the salt merchant,

573
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,560
took bribes and perverted the law,

574
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,240
and lined his own pockets.

575
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,280
He embezzled most of the supplies.

576
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,440
Mr. Xie,

577
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,600
tell everyone

578
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,640
where the supplies are.

579
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,000
Indeed.

580
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,680
Indeed, they are in my place.

581
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,760
Nonsense!

582
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,720
Totally nonsense!

583
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,760
Our country's security

584
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,920
is in our hands,

585
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,720
and yet we serve it on an empty stomach.

586
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,000
The soldiers died
because they were unarmed.

587
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:45,920
What are you doing?

588
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,040
What are you doing?

589
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,760
This is rebellion!

590
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,640
Hand them over!

591
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,360
Beat him to death!

593
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,800
Tai, wake up. Don't scare me.

594
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:08,800
It's okay.

595
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,600
Given his size,

596
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,040
two days of sleep will be enough.

597
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,240
Thank you, Magistrate Di.

598
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,600
With these materials,

599
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,600
you can update your weapons and armor.

600
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,000
Not just the materials.

601
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,960
You helped us get our dignity back.

602
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,360
There is one more thing.

603
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,480
Those child soldiers

604
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,760
were wronged and driven to death.

605
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,440
They were 14 years old or so.

606
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,800
Harsh military discipline

607
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,280
stifled their instincts,

608
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,760
achieving the opposite effect.

609
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,120
They got caught up in a storm

610
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,880
and died for nothing.

611
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,040
It's a pity.

612
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,280
It's lamentable.

613
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,960
Leaving.

[Penglai County Magistrate's Office]

615
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,710
Mr. Hong,

616
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,440
yesterday I was sorting
through the fellows' belongings.

617
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,560
I discovered this.

618
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,400
I was in a hurry to bring it here.

619
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,360
[Pawn Ticket]
I don't know if it is useful to you.

620
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,710
Pawn ticket?

00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,710
This is the client's stub.

622
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,150
They must have recently pawned something

623
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,120
at Zhong's Pawn Shop.

624
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,600
Thank you.

625
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,400
Magistrate,

626
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,800
I've been hiding something from you.

627
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,840
I knew you as Qiao Tai

628
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,840
from way back.

629
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,680
You are my assistant.

630
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,520
Don't mention

631
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,200
the past again.

632
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,560
Magistrate, Mr. Hong wants to see you.

633
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,320
Don't mention it.

634
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,640
Tai, don't worry.

635
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,120
I didn't tell Magistrate
about your embarrassing things.

636
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,880
I told him

637
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,080
you went into battle

638
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,520
and killed the enemies bravely.

639
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,160
However,

640
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,160
you met a treacherous person

641
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,480
and were harmed by him.

642
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,600
But

643
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,680
you still put up a strong fight.

644
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,480
Did Magistrate believe it?

645
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,160

Otherwise,

648
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,360
it would be too late.

649
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,120
That's right.

650
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,280
My heart was in my throat at that time.

651
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,560
Fortunately, Magistrate bought us time.

652
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,080
There are so many documents.

653
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,120
How did you recite them all?

654
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,800
There are so many documents.

655
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,800
I can't recite them all.

656
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,240
So you...

657
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,480
So I made it up.

now Ying'er and the eighth camp

This case

662
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,400
might have to return
to the starting point

663
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,880
and be re-investigated.

664
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,280

showed me a new direction.

What happened?

00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,760
I went past the market just now.

673
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,320
I heard the discussions
among the merchants.

680
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,320
to the military camp aggressively.

to save Magistrate Di.
