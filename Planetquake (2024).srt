1
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,729
PJ, this is Captain Vogel.
Do you read me? Over.

2
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,466
Loud and clear, Captain.
Over.

3
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,401
<i>PJ, start initiating</i>
<i>your ascent.</i>

4
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,303
<i>That typhoon that's</i>
<i>been developing</i>

5
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:38,171
<i>off the Northwestern</i>
<i>Pacific basin</i>

6
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,107
<i>is picking up speed.</i>

7
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,341
<i>Our return time has</i>
<i>increased by three hours.</i>

8
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,176
<i>We need to get you</i>
<i>up top, over.</i>

9
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,479
Aye-aye, Captain.
But, uh, I haven't finished

10
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:47,715
securing the warhead.
I am on the last panel.

11
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:50,718
I know, and I've made the call.

12
00:00:50,752 --> 00:00:51,686
We'll finish it tomorrow.

13
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:56,223
Yes, but, uh, this will
delay our schedule.

14
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,626
PJ, this area was a testing
zone during World War II.

15
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,629
Until those fishermen found
that dead marine life,

16
00:01:01,663 --> 00:01:05,432
this area was just fine
for 75 years. Over.

17
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,134
Yes, Captain, but we should
at least chain it,

18
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,703
you know, just in case.

19
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,237
I mean, you said to
yourself the typhoon...

20
00:01:11,873 --> 00:01:14,274
Okay, PJ, you have
five minutes to chain it

21
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:15,577
and then you have to
start making your ascent.

22
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,344
That is an order.

23
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:18,546
Copy?

24
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,447
<i>Copy that, Captain.</i>

25
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,616
All right.

26
00:01:37,699 --> 00:01:41,168
Uh, Captain, I almost
lost the drillhead.

27
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:44,137
This rock formation here
is different in this area.

28
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:45,372
I don't know.

29
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:48,576
It's, it's softer or weaker.

30
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,344
I cannot continue to work
on this

31
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:51,746
with the equipment
I currently have.

32
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,881
I'm going to start
the ascent. Over.

33
00:01:53,915 --> 00:01:56,116
Understood.
Start the ascent. Over.

34
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:08,195
Captain, there is a
rip current developing.

35
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,865
I'm fighting to control the sub.

36
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:13,568
There is a lot of movement
on the ocean floor.

37
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:17,371
My visibility is zero and my
monitors are cutting in and out.

38
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:20,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what do you mean movement?

39
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,510
<i>PJ, you're in extremely</i>
<i>close proximity</i>

40
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:26,446
to a potentially live
nuclear explosive.

41
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,448
<i>Look, I can be your eyes,</i>

42
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,150
but I need to know exactly
what's going on down there.

43
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:39,192
I have regained visibility and I
am continuing the ascent. Over.

44
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:52,640
PJ.

45
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:56,243
PJ? PJ!
PJ, come in.

46
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,950
Coast Guard, do you copy?

47
00:03:02,984 --> 00:03:06,453
This is Vogel from Ocean Clean
at the Mariana Trench .

48
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,623
We have a problem in
the Challenger deep.

49
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:11,826
I say again, we have a problem
in the Challenger deep. Over.

50
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,899
Coast Guard, Mayday, Mayday,
Mayday!

51
00:03:33,014 --> 00:03:34,849
Milly.

52
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:36,483
Hey, have you
seen what's going on?

53
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:37,752
Hey, sorry, Peter.

54
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:38,920
Sophie's about to land,

55
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:40,621
I'm trying to plan this whole

56
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:42,289
end of the school
year celebration.

57
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:42,890
Okay, but there's
something happening.

58
00:03:42,924 --> 00:03:45,660
See what's happening.

59
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:47,662
Okay, I'm not going to be back
before the end of the day.

60
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:49,296
So if you could just
send out the reports,

61
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,497
make sure the data goes out,
gets backed up.

62
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:51,866
I know you've
done this all before,

63
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,300
but just keep me posted, okay?

64
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,301
Milly, there's
something happening.

65
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,804
There's more.

66
00:03:56,838 --> 00:03:58,806
Wait, what is that?

67
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,308
Why are we spiking
in the Philippines?

68
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,677
We initially saw a movement
of the fault line

69
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,778
at the Mariana Plate here.

70
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:04,879
-You can see.
-Wait, no.

71
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,379
This doesn't make any sense.

72
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,348
How is the first recorded
reading so large?

73
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,884
We haven't picked up any
foreshocks that would indicate

74
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,519
an earthquake of
the size is coming.

75
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,521
Nothing leading up to this.

76
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:16,389
What was the magnitude
when it first hit?

77
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,959
Initially it hit a
3.4 in the Richter.

78
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:19,493
Nothing out of the ordinary.

79
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:20,962
Then it dropped and we had
some smaller activities.

80
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:23,731
Then it picked up a 6.1.

81
00:04:23,765 --> 00:04:25,398
Then a 7.3 and then an 8.

82
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,768
If this keeps increasing...

83
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:29,036
-An 8?
-Yes.

84
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,805
Are you sure these are accurate?

85
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:35,810
We gotta go.

86
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:39,580
Yeah, we triple checked for
any and all anomalies.

87
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:41,716
Once it hit a 7.3, it started
jumping around again.

88
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:43,416
I haven't figured
out a pattern yet,

89
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,986
but the readings are
steadily climbing.

90
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,821
We're lucky it didn't
hit near land.

91
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:49,590
Guam and the Mariana islands
are on tsunami watch now.

92
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:52,727
Peter, the largest recorded
earthquake is a 9.5

93
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,762
and you're saying
this started at an 8.

94
00:04:54,796 --> 00:04:57,598
And it's still climbing.

95
00:04:57,632 --> 00:05:01,569
I mean in theory, we could pass
a 9.5 but not in our lifetime.

96
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:03,470
The fault lines
don't shift that fast.

97
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:04,872
-At least they shouldn't.
-I know.

98
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:07,742
Also, the DHS and FEMA have
been both requesting

99
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:10,410
minute to minute projections
on evacuation contingencies.

100
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,412
One second, this just happened.

101
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,749
How are the quakes all along the
ring of fire already so large?

102
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:16,617
I'm not sure,
that's why we need you.

103
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:22,056
You picked up only
one initial amplitude.

104
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:24,692
How did one earthquake
hit all of these places?

105
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:27,460
They are 2000 miles apart.

106
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,564
No, this is too big
to be an earthquake.

107
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:31,032
This is more like an explosion.

108
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:32,465
Yeah, that's what
the news is saying.

109
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:33,801
At first they thought
an oil rig exploded

110
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:35,670
and caused chain reaction.

111
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:37,104
Now they're saying
it's something bigger.

112
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:39,607
A firm, hired to clean up
nuclear weapons,

113
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,775
somehow started
these earthquakes.

114
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,643
Nuclear weapons?

115
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:45,079
Old nuclear like World War II
in the Challenger Deep.

116
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:47,447
Their operation disturbed
the Pacific,

117
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,417
the Philippines, and
the Australian plate lines,

118
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,120
and triggered
a massive earthquake.

119
00:05:53,154 --> 00:05:55,723
The motion from the convergent
plates caused the waste

120
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:58,391
to go directly up
into Earth's upper mantle.

121
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:01,028
This explosion
caused these quakes.

122
00:06:01,062 --> 00:06:03,496
The Bikini Atoll tests.

123
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:04,565
Yeah.

124
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:06,433
Oh.

125
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,435
<i>Hi, sweetheart.</i>
<i>I'm just calling.</i>

126
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:11,539
Josh, listen, we picked up
very large, irregular readings,

127
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:13,808
and there are earthquakes
all along the ring of fire.

128
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:21,414
Go, go, go!

129
00:06:34,095 --> 00:06:37,665
<i>Milly?</i>
<i>Milly?</i>

130
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,634
-You okay?
-Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

131
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:40,635
<i>What is it?</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>

132
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:42,103
I'm not sure yet.

133
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:43,638
It's caught us
completely off-guard.

134
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:45,106
There's large plate
movement in Asia.

135
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:47,041
<i>And all along</i>
<i>the ring of fire.</i>

136
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,709
We need to figure
out an interval time.

137
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:50,678
And we need to get in
contact with Sophie.

138
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:52,146
<i>Just keep doing what</i>
<i>you're doing, it'll call her.</i>

139
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:53,948
<i>I think her flight's</i>
<i>still in the air.</i>

140
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:55,448
<i>I'll let you know</i>
<i>the second I have an update.</i>

141
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,618
<i>-I love you. </i>
-I love you, too.

142
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:03,624
Peter, do you have
the projection mapping?

143
00:07:03,658 --> 00:07:05,960
So I fed the readings
into an AI algorithm

144
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:08,495
to plot hypothetical movement.

145
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:11,198
All right, I input everything
we picked up so far.

146
00:07:11,232 --> 00:07:14,669
The Philippines, Taiwan, Japan.

147
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:15,870
And don't forget
about Australia.

148
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:16,871
Australia, got it.

149
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:22,442
There's activity at the western
edge of the Pacific Plate.

150
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:38,526
In 72 hours the eastern
side of the Pacific Plate

151
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:41,028
will have the same
tectonic shift.

152
00:07:41,062 --> 00:07:42,897
The entire west coast
of the U.S.

153
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,734
and the knock-on effect
would include Central America.

154
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:49,904
All experiencing earthquakes
starting at 8.0.

155
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:53,040
It's working its way around
the Pacific Rim towards us.

156
00:07:53,074 --> 00:07:54,909
When it gets here...

157
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:56,911
The destruction
would be...

158
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:58,779
Unfathomable.

159
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:02,083
All right, Peter,
I have to take this.

160
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:03,851
Call Gayle at FEMA.

161
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:05,753
Make sure she's up
to speed on everything

162
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:07,021
and make sure they have
the latest projections.

163
00:08:12,827 --> 00:08:14,095
-Mom...
<i>-Sweetheart.</i>

164
00:08:14,128 --> 00:08:15,262
Forget about baggage claim.

165
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:16,797
<i>Mom, we're still in the air.</i>

166
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:19,600
We're being diverted
to another airport,

167
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:21,035
but it hasn't been
allocated yet.

168
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:23,571
What did the crew say?

169
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:26,941
The captain made an announcement
about some earthquake in Seattle

170
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:30,011
and then that we were waiting
for an alternate runway.

171
00:08:30,044 --> 00:08:32,246
What's going on?

172
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,582
Sophie, there
was an earthquake.

173
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:36,250
And the runway's
are most likely damaged

174
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:38,152
or full of grounded planes.

175
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,955
Stay calm and just do
what they tell you, okay?

176
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:43,257
Excuse me, Miss.

177
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,659
We ask that you refrain
from using mobile devices

178
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:47,294
while we're circling.
Thank you.

179
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:49,697
Sorry.
I'm on the phone with my mom.

180
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,232
Just tell your mom
that you love her

181
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:52,800
and be off by the time
I come back around.

182
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,602
Oh, no, but I--

183
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,303
<i>Hey, just listen to</i>
<i>what the crew says.</i>

184
00:08:56,337 --> 00:08:59,173
Please call us as
soon as you've landed

185
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,775
and your dad will come
and pick you up.

186
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:03,244
<i>Save as much battery power</i>
<i>as you can</i>

187
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:04,812
and if you see any
water bottles,

188
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:06,247
put them in your bag, okay?

189
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,216
Okay, Mom.
I love you.

190
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,551
I love you, too.

191
00:09:31,172 --> 00:09:32,706
Okay, looks like we got
a live one.

192
00:09:53,194 --> 00:09:56,297
<i>Major Anderson, leave TCP and</i>
<i>head up the aircraft S&R. Over.</i>

193
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,032
Copy that, sir.
I'll let my team know.

194
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:59,900
-Sergeant.
-Sir.

195
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:00,968
I've asked to head up
the search and rescue team

196
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,136
for the downed aircraft.

197
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:02,970
They've given me the go ahead.

198
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:04,872
Understood, sir.

199
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:06,407
I'm going to call
air traffic control,

200
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,741
find out where those airplanes
are hitting the concrete.

201
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:09,743
Roger that, sir.

202
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:12,379
I got it.
I got it.

203
00:10:12,413 --> 00:10:13,314
Yeah, this is--

204
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:18,119
Yeah, hold.

205
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:23,324
It's the White House...
for you.

206
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:30,998
Hello, this is Dr. Anderson
at the NEIC.

207
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:33,167
Dr. Anderson.
I'm General West,

208
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,736
Director of the
National Security Agency.

209
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:37,037
Yes, General.
I know who you are.

210
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:38,939
Okay, good.

211
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:40,407
I'm sure your office is
at threat level red.

212
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:42,409
<i>That's why I'm calling.</i>

213
00:10:42,443 --> 00:10:45,079
I know your brother,
Dresden Anderson.

214
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:49,083
I need his help, but I no
longer have his contact info.

215
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:50,784
Neither do I. General--

216
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:53,354
When he quit,
he went off the grid.

217
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:55,890
I need you to find him
immediately.

218
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:58,926
You're the NSA.
Why do you need my help?

219
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,761
Doctor, is this line secure?

220
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:02,997
No.

221
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,099
You have three days to
get him to contact me.

222
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:07,201
And what should I say?

223
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,335
Mention Star Wars.

224
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,341
Star Wars.

225
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,943
Star Wars like the movie?

226
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:19,046
No, Peter.

227
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:22,349
Star Wars was a weapons
initiative started in the 80s.

228
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,122
So, your brother worked
for the government?

229
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:32,993
He was a scientist and then
became a weapons technician.

230
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:38,465
They revisited the project a few
years ago and then he got fired.

231
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:39,900
And then he just sort
of disappeared.

232
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,139
Then what happened?

233
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:48,442
Work was really his only passion
and it kind of broke him.

234
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,778
He never recovered.

235
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:56,183
He started to isolate,
cut off ties from people.

236
00:11:56,217 --> 00:12:01,088
I tried to get him to explain
what happened, but he wouldn't.

237
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:03,290
But when you're talking
about your brother...

238
00:12:03,324 --> 00:12:07,828
Peter, just stop.

239
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:11,765
Imagine if Einstein was trapped
in the paranoia of Ted Kaczynski

240
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,901
with the ego of Elon Musk.

241
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:15,102
Sheesh.

242
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:17,371
Yeah, that's my brother.

243
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:20,007
I still miss him.
I still love him.

244
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,177
And he's brilliant.

245
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,746
<i>Leave a message.</i>
<i>Maybe I'll call you back.</i>

246
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:32,520
Dresden. It's Milly.

247
00:12:32,554 --> 00:12:36,824
Your ex-boss,
I guess, just called.

248
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:39,493
Look, I don't know what
you did this time,

249
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:41,328
but everyone's looking for you.

250
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:43,397
All right, you don't
have to call me back.

251
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,999
But if you could
call back the general,

252
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:47,434
he said to mention Star Wars

253
00:12:47,468 --> 00:12:48,769
and that you have three days.

254
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:02,216
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we were allocated a runway</i>

255
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:04,485
<i>but the volume of planes</i>
<i>extended the clearing process</i>

256
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:07,321
<i>and it's cost us a lot of fuel.</i>

257
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:08,922
<i>We have to make</i>
<i>an emergency landing</i>

258
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:14,128
<i>on the closest and</i>
<i>safest stretch of land.</i>

259
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:16,430
<i>Remain seated with</i>
<i>your seat belts fastened.</i>

260
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,499
<i>Flight crew, take your seats</i>
<i>and prepare</i>

261
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:19,534
<i>for an emergency landing.</i>

262
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:28,510
If we follow the same patterns
as Japan and Australia,

263
00:13:28,543 --> 00:13:30,210
the quakes will
continue to grow.

264
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:31,912
We can't keep up.

265
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:33,280
We won't have time
to get everyone out.

266
00:13:33,314 --> 00:13:35,517
Especially with the runways
already damaged.

267
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,152
The knock-on effect
we can't fully measure.

268
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:41,055
Like island arc volcanoes,
subduction zone plates.

269
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:42,923
What if we try and divert
some of the energy

270
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:44,091
along the plate lines?

271
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:46,360
It would cause a bigger problem.

272
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:48,262
Look up the coast.

273
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:51,265
The neighboring plates contain
the Cascadia subduction zone.

274
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:54,068
The Pacific Northwest has
been due a magnitude of nine

275
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:57,539
for over 75 years.

276
00:13:57,572 --> 00:13:59,173
It's only a matter of time.

277
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:05,547
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we are about to make contact.</i>

278
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,214
<i>Get into</i>
<i>the brace position now.</i>

279
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:46,120
Oh!

280
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:46,887
Get down.

281
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,396
That was a 7.1.

282
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:57,532
The first was 6.3.

283
00:14:57,565 --> 00:14:59,667
The plates are moving so fast.

284
00:14:59,701 --> 00:15:01,468
It's not giving off
the usual warning signs,

285
00:15:01,503 --> 00:15:04,471
so we're not picking up
readings until it's too late.

286
00:15:04,506 --> 00:15:05,673
Clearly, you haven't
been analyzing

287
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:07,609
the information correctly.

288
00:15:07,642 --> 00:15:09,143
Dresden.

289
00:15:09,176 --> 00:15:12,647
How did you get in?

290
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,149
That's your first question?

291
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:18,152
No wonder you haven't
figured this out yet.

292
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:20,454
I'm going to need to see
everything you guys got.

293
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:21,689
Dresden, hi.

294
00:15:21,723 --> 00:15:23,190
Peter Houston,
nice to meet you.

295
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:23,957
Heard so much about you.

296
00:15:27,729 --> 00:15:30,230
So, I just called.

297
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:33,167
I didn't expect you to show up.

298
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,403
Think I needed a phone call
to know you needed my help?

299
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:38,205
I knew you were
in over your head.

300
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:41,375
Moment those quakes started,
I was on my way.

301
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:42,943
So, let's get to work.

302
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,582
<i>Everybody, please remain calm.</i>

303
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:50,417
<i>If you are able to move,</i>
<i>please slowly make your way</i>

304
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:53,487
<i>to our member of Cabin Staff</i>
<i>in the emergency exit area.</i>

305
00:15:53,521 --> 00:15:55,389
Listen up.
If you are able to move,

306
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:57,659
please make your way slowly
to the back of the plane.

307
00:15:57,692 --> 00:16:00,394
If you are injured, stay put,

308
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:04,198
and I'm going to come around
with the first aid kit.

309
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:05,165
Are you okay, sir?

310
00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:10,404
Sophie?
Sophie, are you alright?

311
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:11,739
<i>I'm alive.</i>

312
00:16:11,773 --> 00:16:13,608
I'm still in the plane,
but we crashed.

313
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:16,276
Sweetie, you're alive,
and that's all that matters.

314
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,045
<i>You need to listen to me.</i>

315
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,548
You need to get off that
plane as soon as possible.

316
00:16:20,582 --> 00:16:22,416
You're not safe.

317
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:23,651
Where are you?

318
00:16:23,685 --> 00:16:25,720
Um...

319
00:16:25,753 --> 00:16:27,755
I think we're in Discovery Park.

320
00:16:27,789 --> 00:16:30,023
I think I see
the fort lot and chapel.

321
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:31,191
I'll send you my location.

322
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:40,067
What was that?

323
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,803
<i>I don't know.</i>

324
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:43,538
It feels like we're n the edge
of a cliff or something.

325
00:16:43,571 --> 00:16:46,273
Everyone!
Get to the back of the plane!

326
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:48,141
Now!

327
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:53,247
<i>Sophie? Sophie, your dad</i>
<i>is coming for you.</i>

328
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,549
Sophie!

329
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:03,290
I'm on my way.

330
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:04,391
I have the coordinates
for the plane.

331
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:05,560
They landed in Discovery Park.

332
00:17:05,593 --> 00:17:06,694
They landed.

333
00:17:06,728 --> 00:17:08,563
And she's still alive,

334
00:17:08,596 --> 00:17:11,465
but they are sitting ducks
until the next quake hits.

335
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:14,101
I'll find her.
I'll be to her soon.

336
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:25,078
Josh! Joshua?

337
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:28,115
The lines are down.

338
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:30,585
Cell towers can't take the
frequencies of these quakes.

339
00:17:30,618 --> 00:17:32,587
How much time do we have?

340
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,288
70 hours to evac
the West Coast

341
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:36,423
and Central America
before it's swallowed.

342
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:43,363
-Come on, open the doors.
-Are we gonna be okay?

343
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:45,499
The front door, it's jammed.
I can't open it.

344
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:47,735
Do you think if I
smash one of these windows

345
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:49,169
that we can fit through it?

346
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:51,204
Maybe you could fit through,

347
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:52,640
but we're going to need
about 5,000 pounds of force

348
00:17:52,674 --> 00:17:55,375
to break it open.

349
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:56,744
All right, next option.

350
00:18:01,883 --> 00:18:04,519
Hold on, it's another one.

351
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:06,621
Captain, you need to leave
the radio and get out now.

352
00:18:06,654 --> 00:18:08,523
The ground is opening.

353
00:18:08,556 --> 00:18:11,158
I need to try every frequency.
No one knows we're here.

354
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:13,360
You don't have time.
The plane is about to separate.

355
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:22,235
It's settling.

356
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:25,172
Are you all right?

357
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:27,307
I'll be fine.
I think I broke my arm.

358
00:18:28,843 --> 00:18:31,646
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?

359
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,213
I think I'm doing okay.

360
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:34,515
Good. Are you willing and
able to help me?

361
00:18:36,751 --> 00:18:38,686
-Uh, sure.
-Great.

362
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,421
I took a few courses at first
aid in CPR in high school.

363
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:43,457
Great. That's great.

364
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,559
Then you can help me with the
rest of the passengers, then.

365
00:18:44,592 --> 00:18:46,694
Okay.

366
00:18:46,728 --> 00:18:48,228
We need to get off this plane

367
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:49,864
before another
earthquake swallows us.

368
00:18:49,897 --> 00:18:53,568
There's a ladder in the rear.
We can use that, okay?

369
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:55,268
Are there no other flight
attendants? I don't--

370
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:57,705
No, it's a small plane.

371
00:18:57,739 --> 00:19:00,575
Hey, everyone, we are
going to be performing

372
00:19:00,608 --> 00:19:03,578
an emergency
aircraft evacuation.

373
00:19:03,611 --> 00:19:06,380
I need your complete and utter
cooperation and listen to me.

374
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:08,281
Okay?

375
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,585
I'm going to leave you
in the hands of...

376
00:19:10,618 --> 00:19:12,252
Sophie.

377
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:13,721
Sophie, she is going
to help you

378
00:19:13,755 --> 00:19:16,724
while I gather the emergency
equipment.

379
00:19:16,758 --> 00:19:18,660
We need to organize ourselves
so that the injured passengers

380
00:19:18,693 --> 00:19:20,695
get off the plane first.

381
00:19:20,728 --> 00:19:22,730
If we say calm,
we can get through this quickly

382
00:19:22,764 --> 00:19:24,599
and safely together.

383
00:19:24,632 --> 00:19:25,867
Thank you.

384
00:19:28,703 --> 00:19:31,271
Okay, everyone.

385
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:32,674
What would you do, Mom?

386
00:19:34,642 --> 00:19:36,744
Ladies and gentlemen,
if we want to live,

387
00:19:36,778 --> 00:19:39,647
we need to start listening.
Okay?

388
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:42,449
We need to get off of this plane
before another earthquake hits

389
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:45,653
and the only way we do
that is if we work together.

390
00:19:45,687 --> 00:19:47,655
We're going to throw a rope
ladder off the back exit,

391
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:48,623
and get off the plane.

392
00:19:48,656 --> 00:19:50,223
No rushing.

393
00:19:50,257 --> 00:19:51,224
Please, and thank you.

394
00:19:54,896 --> 00:19:57,665
Whoa!

395
00:20:09,944 --> 00:20:11,746
The quakes have reached
South America

396
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:12,980
and are heading our way.

397
00:20:13,014 --> 00:20:14,749
How can we slow
the tectonic plates?

398
00:20:14,782 --> 00:20:16,216
Let me show you, okay?

399
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,524
Okay, listen up.

400
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:26,694
Just imagine this is a plate.

401
00:20:26,728 --> 00:20:30,798
When the plate starts to move
with so much force,

402
00:20:30,832 --> 00:20:33,467
the neighboring plates
have to move.

403
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,470
And the momentum is so great,
they won't stop.

404
00:20:36,504 --> 00:20:38,740
They can't stop on their own.

405
00:20:38,773 --> 00:20:43,678
So what we need is a force so
strong that it'll counteract it.

406
00:20:43,711 --> 00:20:45,345
Simple enough?

407
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:48,516
Yes, a plate shift in
the opposite direction.

408
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:50,383
Let's have the tracking
software generate

409
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:52,687
the precise impact location
for the energy surge

410
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,823
that'll neutralize
the plates momentum.

411
00:20:55,857 --> 00:20:58,960
Okay, I've never used
a program to such a degree,

412
00:20:58,993 --> 00:21:01,328
but in theory,
I suppose it could work.

413
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:02,797
I mean, I'd have to input some.

414
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,264
Are you still in school?

415
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,802
Just do it and
save those coordinates.

416
00:21:07,835 --> 00:21:09,302
Dresden, come with me now.

417
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:22,583
We all know how smart you are.

418
00:21:22,617 --> 00:21:25,586
And we are oh
so very grateful that

419
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,089
the mighty Dresden has
graced us with his--

420
00:21:28,122 --> 00:21:29,524
You don't seem to understand.

421
00:21:29,557 --> 00:21:31,659
No, for once,
you don't understand.

422
00:21:31,692 --> 00:21:34,529
This is what we do here,
day in and day out,

423
00:21:34,562 --> 00:21:36,831
and it might not run the
way that you like it to,

424
00:21:36,864 --> 00:21:38,666
but this is the way
I run things.

425
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:41,334
This is my world,
just the way you have yours.

426
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:42,970
Milly, it's not about that.

427
00:21:43,004 --> 00:21:45,940
No.

428
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:47,842
You might not understand this,

429
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:51,612
but I actually like and care
about the people I work with.

430
00:21:51,646 --> 00:21:54,682
Pretty sure they feel
the same way about me.

431
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:59,554
And that kid in there,
he might be a nobody to you.

432
00:21:59,587 --> 00:22:01,589
But he has chosen
to stay here and help us

433
00:22:01,622 --> 00:22:03,758
in the best way he can,

434
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:06,961
even though he has friends and
family back home that need him.

435
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:09,396
And he knows in the back
of his head

436
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:13,067
there is a very good chance
he will never see them again.

437
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:16,971
Is any of this
getting through to you?

438
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,441
Good.

439
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:22,543
So let's try this again.

440
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:30,651
-Now...
-Um, actually...

441
00:22:30,685 --> 00:22:32,019
I'm still curious
about the Star Wars reference.

442
00:22:34,522 --> 00:22:37,390
Well, bet you are, Peter.

443
00:22:39,126 --> 00:22:42,630
So the Star Wars project, A.K.A.

444
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:45,600
Reagan's Strategic
Defense Initiative,

445
00:22:45,633 --> 00:22:48,435
Cold War Tech that
would generate

446
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:51,438
an outer space base shield
that would

447
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:53,608
render nuclear
missiles obsolete.

448
00:22:53,641 --> 00:22:56,744
Project was dismantled
four years later in '87.

449
00:22:56,777 --> 00:22:59,547
At least that's what
they told the public.

450
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,017
But in fact,
missiles, the lasers,

451
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,485
the particle beam
weapons still exist.

452
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:07,955
They've been up there the whole
time just adding

453
00:23:07,989 --> 00:23:11,626
to the ever increasing
list of space junk.

454
00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:14,028
I'm confused.
How does this help?

455
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:16,664
Four years ago,
last administration

456
00:23:16,697 --> 00:23:20,635
signed the National
Defense Authorization Act

457
00:23:20,668 --> 00:23:22,770
where they started to
carry out maintenance

458
00:23:22,803 --> 00:23:25,573
and making it operational.

459
00:23:25,606 --> 00:23:31,779
If we focus the laser on
the plate's eastern edge,

460
00:23:31,812 --> 00:23:33,814
it actually might be
enough to halt it.

461
00:23:35,182 --> 00:23:37,184
Then let's do it.

462
00:23:37,218 --> 00:23:39,654
We can't.

463
00:23:39,687 --> 00:23:43,591
If our enemies knew that
Star Wars exists,

464
00:23:43,624 --> 00:23:45,092
they could use it
to destroy the world.

465
00:23:47,728 --> 00:23:51,866
Dresden, the world
is going to end regardless.

466
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:56,203
Star Wars is the only way to
stop the plate, than so be it.

467
00:23:56,237 --> 00:23:58,005
There's got to be a better way.

468
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:59,573
We don't have time.

469
00:23:59,607 --> 00:24:01,742
Every minute we are
wasting millions,

470
00:24:01,776 --> 00:24:03,744
billions of lives
around the line.

471
00:24:03,778 --> 00:24:05,212
I don't think we have
any better ideas.

472
00:24:05,246 --> 00:24:05,980
Nobody asked you.

473
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:11,953
Then do you have
any better ideas?

474
00:24:11,986 --> 00:24:14,755
One single better idea that
we can implement in time?

475
00:24:16,023 --> 00:24:17,158
No, I don't.

476
00:24:18,726 --> 00:24:19,459
You're right.

477
00:24:20,761 --> 00:24:21,862
Let's implement Star Wars.

478
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,732
Thank you.

479
00:24:24,765 --> 00:24:26,100
Don't thank me yet.

480
00:24:29,637 --> 00:24:32,106
I don't get why the
phone lines are still down.

481
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:34,108
The backup satellite should
have kicked in by now.

482
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:35,776
We need a way
to contact Washington.

483
00:24:37,645 --> 00:24:39,246
We can just sit around and wait.

484
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,850
You're on thin ice right now.

485
00:24:42,883 --> 00:24:43,918
Do you have any better ideas?

486
00:24:43,951 --> 00:24:45,786
Yes.

487
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,955
I have a friend that
works for the NSC.

488
00:24:47,989 --> 00:24:49,590
Her office is close by.

489
00:24:49,623 --> 00:24:51,192
I actually went
to college with her.

490
00:24:51,225 --> 00:24:53,794
She worked on the project
the first time around.

491
00:24:53,828 --> 00:24:56,564
She'll have a working line
to Washington.

492
00:24:56,597 --> 00:24:59,934
We're not going to drive
all the way across town.

493
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:09,043
The parking lot's this way.

494
00:25:25,993 --> 00:25:27,561
Think I parked in there?

495
00:25:34,001 --> 00:25:35,236
Come on, let's go.

496
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:42,276
Yep.

497
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:43,677
This is it.

498
00:25:49,817 --> 00:25:51,819
Come on.

499
00:25:51,852 --> 00:25:54,989
It always does this.
Just give it a second.

500
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:56,924
Come on. Come on.

501
00:25:58,259 --> 00:25:59,927
There we go.
I told you.

502
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,962
Great.
Let's get out of here.

503
00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:03,097
Let's go.

504
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,016
So this friend at the NSC.

505
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:24,018
Dr. Diane Wright.

506
00:26:24,051 --> 00:26:26,220
Do you think
she'll still be there?

507
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:28,022
We're still working, aren't we?

508
00:26:28,055 --> 00:26:30,057
She'll be there.

509
00:26:30,091 --> 00:26:32,226
It's her life.

510
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:33,994
She puts everything
into her work.

511
00:26:36,697 --> 00:26:39,133
Only if the government would
have actually listened to her.

512
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:53,314
Sir.
I've loaded the coordinates.

513
00:26:53,347 --> 00:26:55,749
It's basically a straight
shot from here.

514
00:26:55,783 --> 00:26:57,918
All units, let's move
to close column.

515
00:26:57,952 --> 00:27:00,054
Keep the speed under 25
on a unit gap

516
00:27:00,087 --> 00:27:01,856
of no more than 50 meters, over.

517
00:27:01,889 --> 00:27:03,357
<i>Copy.</i>

518
00:27:18,739 --> 00:27:19,740
All right.
There's no way around that.

519
00:27:19,773 --> 00:27:21,108
We're completely blocked.

520
00:27:21,142 --> 00:27:23,210
How far are we from the plane?

521
00:27:23,244 --> 00:27:25,880
Not far.
15-20 minutes tops.

522
00:27:25,913 --> 00:27:27,882
But on foot
it'll be over an hour.

523
00:27:27,915 --> 00:27:28,949
Come on, we don't have
that kind of time.

524
00:27:28,983 --> 00:27:30,384
We're out of other options.

525
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:32,186
No. We can't get
out of the vehicle.

526
00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:33,754
These people need
food and water.

527
00:27:33,787 --> 00:27:35,089
We can't carry
all the supplies,

528
00:27:35,122 --> 00:27:36,457
let alone the medical equipment.

529
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,391
There's got to be another way.

530
00:27:38,993 --> 00:27:41,195
What about the long way around?

531
00:27:41,228 --> 00:27:42,863
Wait. Isn't there a cemetery?

532
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:47,701
Yes.
Right behind these buildings.

533
00:27:47,735 --> 00:27:50,104
You're right.

534
00:27:50,137 --> 00:27:51,772
All right. Listen.

535
00:27:51,805 --> 00:27:53,140
There was a gate about
a half a mile back.

536
00:27:53,174 --> 00:27:55,910
We get enough speed, we can pull
a rig right through it.

537
00:27:55,943 --> 00:27:58,412
We can avoid
all this rubble.

538
00:27:58,445 --> 00:27:59,680
Copy, Sergeant.

539
00:28:04,251 --> 00:28:05,019
Please be there, Sophie.

540
00:28:15,496 --> 00:28:17,731
Come on. Quick.
I need help.

541
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:25,005
It's already so bad.

542
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,241
It's only going to get worse
if we don't get it together.

543
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:52,800
Of course,
we have a dedicated uplink.

544
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:56,136
Though it's safe to say, I never
expected to utilize the SDI.

545
00:28:57,404 --> 00:28:58,872
From what you're saying,

546
00:28:58,906 --> 00:29:00,074
it seems that this is
our only choice.

547
00:29:04,345 --> 00:29:06,046
General West...

548
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,349
This is Dr. Diane Wright
at the Seattle Comms.

549
00:29:08,382 --> 00:29:10,317
I know who you are, doctor.

550
00:29:10,351 --> 00:29:12,987
Now, if I'm speaking to you,
I'm assuming that Dresden is--

551
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,522
Wes, yeah, I'm here.

552
00:29:14,556 --> 00:29:15,923
I'm not very happy, though.

553
00:29:17,525 --> 00:29:20,261
But you can thank
my sister, Milly.

554
00:29:20,294 --> 00:29:23,330
I'm sure your sister told you
why I needed to speak with you.

555
00:29:23,364 --> 00:29:25,199
Yeah, you need my help.

556
00:29:25,232 --> 00:29:27,034
Before you say anything else,
I want you to know

557
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:29,203
that I'm willing
to forget the past.

558
00:29:29,236 --> 00:29:31,338
If you help us now,
we make it through,

559
00:29:31,372 --> 00:29:33,240
there'll be no ramifications.

560
00:29:33,274 --> 00:29:35,142
What did he do?

561
00:29:35,175 --> 00:29:37,845
Walked out with the access
and the firing codes

562
00:29:37,878 --> 00:29:41,048
to the weapons that
he's decided to use now.

563
00:29:41,081 --> 00:29:43,017
No country should
have that much power.

564
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,852
Dresden, that's confidential.

565
00:29:44,885 --> 00:29:47,221
I had to, to save the world.

566
00:29:47,254 --> 00:29:49,923
Well, that's what
we're about to do now.

567
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:53,160
Exactly, which is why we
need you to bring it online.

568
00:29:53,193 --> 00:29:55,429
Our current engineering
team can barely

569
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:58,065
navigate the archaic
operating system,

570
00:29:58,098 --> 00:30:00,868
not to mention the
firewalls you put in.

571
00:30:00,901 --> 00:30:04,238
Dr. Wright, I understand you're
familiar with this system.

572
00:30:04,271 --> 00:30:06,040
<i>More or less, sir.</i>

573
00:30:06,073 --> 00:30:07,509
Although I was never made
aware that the weapons

574
00:30:07,542 --> 00:30:09,577
that Dresden and I
were working on

575
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:11,445
were ever being
made operational.

576
00:30:11,478 --> 00:30:13,548
<i>They haven't.</i>
<i>That's why I'm talking to you.</i>

577
00:30:13,581 --> 00:30:16,383
I need the original
engineering team.

578
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:20,087
So far, our calculations
have been all hypothetical.

579
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,356
There has been no way
to test the system

580
00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:24,892
and no room for error.

581
00:30:24,925 --> 00:30:27,061
Sir, have you seen the
latest plate projections?

582
00:30:27,094 --> 00:30:28,896
Do you want me to run over
the data one more time with you?

583
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:31,932
Doctor, I respect
your expertise,

584
00:30:31,965 --> 00:30:35,169
but my job is to make
the hard decisions.

585
00:30:35,202 --> 00:30:38,506
Dr. Wright, how quickly can you
get the system up and running?

586
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,141
It's actually up and running.
It's a little clunky, though.

587
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:44,311
I think your engineers kind
of screwed this thing up.

588
00:30:44,345 --> 00:30:46,914
<i>Need you to sign into</i>
<i>the weapons interface.</i>

589
00:30:46,947 --> 00:30:51,085
<i>Validate initiation</i>
<i>with your SWP code.</i>

590
00:30:51,118 --> 00:30:52,186
Entered.

591
00:30:53,454 --> 00:30:54,522
Who has the coordinates?

592
00:30:54,556 --> 00:30:56,123
I have them.

593
00:30:56,156 --> 00:30:57,592
And once the general
enters his SWP code

594
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:59,293
and activates the initiation,

595
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:02,129
I can plug them into server
ID and we can gain access.

596
00:31:02,162 --> 00:31:02,896
-Okay.
-Good.

597
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:20,314
Captain?

598
00:31:20,347 --> 00:31:21,348
Arthur,
can you hear me?

599
00:31:28,288 --> 00:31:29,289
Be careful.

600
00:31:37,197 --> 00:31:39,667
Okay, guys,
there are three points

601
00:31:39,701 --> 00:31:43,270
we need to target, each at
least 300 miles off the coast.

602
00:31:43,303 --> 00:31:46,073
Way out past
the continental shelf.

603
00:31:46,106 --> 00:31:48,676
Okay, the northernmost point
is in the Gulf of Alaska.

604
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:54,549
We have 51, 43'33" north,
138, 1'14" west.

605
00:31:54,582 --> 00:31:59,186
The second point halfway down
the plate is 5 22'21" north.

606
00:31:59,219 --> 00:32:02,256
We have 116 48'42" west

607
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:04,992
and the third perpendicular
to South America is

608
00:32:05,025 --> 00:32:09,163
22 2'4" south,
114 9'25" west.

609
00:32:09,196 --> 00:32:11,699
And you need to set
your angle of entry.

610
00:32:11,733 --> 00:32:14,001
Give me a second
to calculate this.

611
00:32:14,034 --> 00:32:15,369
Aim all the lasers,
so each target will hit it

612
00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:18,305
with an equal force at
an angle of...

613
00:32:18,338 --> 00:32:21,475
42.7 degrees.

614
00:32:21,509 --> 00:32:24,211
If not, we won't
generate enough power.

615
00:32:24,244 --> 00:32:25,647
Or we're going to send these
plates moving

616
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,716
in different
directions altogether.

617
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,752
Yeah.

618
00:32:30,785 --> 00:32:33,688
Okay.
Well, if I have the go ahead...

619
00:32:37,424 --> 00:32:38,492
See you on the other side.

620
00:32:40,595 --> 00:32:42,062
Fire.

621
00:32:42,095 --> 00:32:43,497
Fire.

622
00:32:54,107 --> 00:32:56,176
Come on, come on.
Come on, please.

623
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,285
No, no, only two hit.

624
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,688
Something's wrong.

625
00:33:06,721 --> 00:33:08,690
One of the lasers died.
It's not firing.

626
00:33:08,723 --> 00:33:11,024
That's interesting.
It barely made a scratch.

627
00:33:11,058 --> 00:33:12,059
Does it have enough power?

628
00:33:18,499 --> 00:33:20,434
The quake is working its
way up the west coast.

629
00:33:20,467 --> 00:33:22,336
Mexico just got hit.

630
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:24,438
Just fire again.

631
00:33:24,471 --> 00:33:25,707
-No, no, I can't.
-What do you mean you can't?

632
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,307
They're overheating
and shutting down.

633
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:29,109
I need to run diagnostics
to find out why.

634
00:33:29,142 --> 00:33:30,645
This was a long shot
to begin with.

635
00:33:30,678 --> 00:33:33,080
It was always a chance
it wasn't going to work.

636
00:33:33,113 --> 00:33:37,217
Let's cut our losses
and ramp up the evacuations.

637
00:33:37,251 --> 00:33:38,786
So that's it.

638
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,288
That was just an exercise
for the US government?

639
00:33:41,321 --> 00:33:43,056
No, wait.

640
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,592
What's the angle of entry?

641
00:33:44,626 --> 00:33:47,261
I set it to 42.7 degrees.

642
00:33:47,294 --> 00:33:48,730
Like you said,
the trajectory must be off.

643
00:33:48,763 --> 00:33:51,031
No, the trajectory is not off.

644
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:55,369
No, wait a minute.

645
00:33:55,402 --> 00:33:57,539
Your software wasn't
able to fully account

646
00:33:57,572 --> 00:33:59,574
for the axis shift.

647
00:33:59,607 --> 00:34:02,577
Axis shift?

648
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,646
Dresden's right, sir.

649
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:06,413
Over the past decade,

650
00:34:06,446 --> 00:34:08,382
we've pumped so much
ground water that it

651
00:34:08,415 --> 00:34:12,119
actually altered the axis of the
earth one or two inches a year,

652
00:34:12,152 --> 00:34:14,154
which might not seem like a lot,

653
00:34:14,187 --> 00:34:18,358
but the way these algorithms
calculate the projection,

654
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:21,128
the slightest discrepancy can
throw the results into a spin.

655
00:34:21,161 --> 00:34:24,298
Can we just recalculate
and fire again?

656
00:34:24,331 --> 00:34:27,535
No, but we can use
the functional lasers

657
00:34:27,569 --> 00:34:30,605
and modify the angle
of entry to compensate.

658
00:34:30,638 --> 00:34:31,739
The angle of entry
is proportional

659
00:34:31,773 --> 00:34:34,107
to the power at the target.

660
00:34:34,141 --> 00:34:36,176
So we lost one third of power.

661
00:34:36,209 --> 00:34:39,179
So we're going to need to
reduce the angle of entry to...

662
00:34:39,212 --> 00:34:43,216
30 degrees to make
up for the loss.

663
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,118
Okay, let's adjust
and try again.

664
00:34:48,355 --> 00:34:50,424
Okay, I am adjusting now.

665
00:34:51,826 --> 00:34:54,461
Oh, no.

666
00:34:54,494 --> 00:34:57,431
Get down, get down!
Down under! Down under!

667
00:35:02,904 --> 00:35:04,104
Come on!

668
00:35:05,372 --> 00:35:07,307
Go, go!

669
00:35:09,711 --> 00:35:10,845
There's a military bunker.

670
00:35:10,878 --> 00:35:12,747
It's not far from here.

671
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,683
That's where everyone
from this building was sent.

672
00:35:15,717 --> 00:35:17,484
It wouldn't be on any map.

673
00:35:17,518 --> 00:35:18,886
You wouldn't know about it,
but it's there.

674
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,489
They have a secure connection.

675
00:35:22,523 --> 00:35:23,691
You have the coordinates,
right, Peter?

676
00:35:23,725 --> 00:35:25,760
Yeah.

677
00:35:25,793 --> 00:35:27,929
Okay, that's your best bet.
You guys have to move.

678
00:35:27,962 --> 00:35:29,797
Move before this
building crumbles, okay?

679
00:35:29,831 --> 00:35:30,798
You're not coming with us?

680
00:35:30,832 --> 00:35:32,432
No.

681
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:33,801
No, this is where we part ways.

682
00:35:33,835 --> 00:35:35,770
I have to be with my family.

683
00:35:35,803 --> 00:35:38,238
You don't need another body.

684
00:35:38,271 --> 00:35:40,808
Let's be honest, you're
smart enough for two of us.

685
00:35:40,842 --> 00:35:41,776
We both know it.

686
00:35:43,611 --> 00:35:45,379
Look, I'm sorry.

687
00:35:45,412 --> 00:35:46,681
I'm sorry I didn't do more
to help you out

688
00:35:46,714 --> 00:35:49,216
when you were let go, Dresden.

689
00:35:49,249 --> 00:35:52,285
I put my job and my
work over our friendship.

690
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:55,790
And I'd be lying to say
if it...

691
00:35:55,823 --> 00:35:58,660
it hadn't bothered me
every day since you disappeared.

692
00:36:03,765 --> 00:36:06,299
Thank you, Diane.

693
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:10,170
You really get to know a lot
about people by their actions.

694
00:36:12,272 --> 00:36:14,909
Your actions have
been very clear.

695
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:18,311
And for your own peace of mind,

696
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:20,480
I'm gonna let you give me
your ID with access.

697
00:36:22,517 --> 00:36:24,619
And then what do you say?

698
00:36:24,652 --> 00:36:25,385
Call it even.

699
00:36:30,257 --> 00:36:31,726
Thank you.

700
00:36:31,759 --> 00:36:33,460
It's my pleasure.

701
00:36:33,493 --> 00:36:34,862
Stay safe.

702
00:36:36,496 --> 00:36:39,534
Okay.

703
00:36:39,567 --> 00:36:43,236
How long do we have before
these earthquakes wipe us out?

704
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:45,640
65 hours.

705
00:36:45,673 --> 00:36:47,709
65 hours?

706
00:36:47,742 --> 00:36:48,976
Good luck.

707
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,816
Sophie, are you okay?

708
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:31,318
I'm here.
I'm alive.

709
00:37:31,351 --> 00:37:33,487
Okay, get down as
fast as you can.

710
00:37:33,521 --> 00:37:36,023
The plane can fall
at any moment.

711
00:37:36,057 --> 00:37:38,291
Come on, around away
from the plane.

712
00:37:40,528 --> 00:37:41,929
That's it!
Hurry!

713
00:37:43,831 --> 00:37:45,533
Come on, away
from the plane.

714
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:00,480
Your daughter is gonna be okay.

715
00:38:01,682 --> 00:38:02,984
Your niece?

716
00:38:03,017 --> 00:38:03,951
Yeah.

717
00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:08,321
I don't think we can
drive any further.

718
00:38:17,565 --> 00:38:19,567
The grid is down and the
bunker's our only hope

719
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,835
to get back online.

720
00:38:20,868 --> 00:38:23,070
So, this is where we walk.

721
00:38:23,104 --> 00:38:26,607
There's still a few miles out.

722
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:28,943
This is the only
road to the bunker.

723
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:30,845
You know, we can't turn around.

724
00:38:30,878 --> 00:38:32,747
And the more we sit
here and discuss it,

725
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,082
we're just getting closer
to the next quake.

726
00:38:35,116 --> 00:38:37,450
Agreed.
So, let's go.

727
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:39,587
Peter, grab everything
we need out of the van.

728
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,788
We're not coming back.

729
00:38:54,434 --> 00:38:56,336
Got it, this way.

730
00:39:04,745 --> 00:39:06,047
This way.

731
00:39:12,753 --> 00:39:15,923
Gotta make sure the angle
of entry is correct.

732
00:39:15,957 --> 00:39:17,725
This needs to work next time.

733
00:39:17,758 --> 00:39:19,660
These two aren't
going to figure this out.

734
00:39:19,694 --> 00:39:20,928
Hurry up.

735
00:39:20,962 --> 00:39:22,597
Come on, what are you doing?

736
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:24,765
I gotta use the bathroom.

737
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:28,769
You can go anywhere.

738
00:39:31,438 --> 00:39:32,372
Certain things I don't do.

739
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:36,911
Gotta be kidding me.

740
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:46,087
You guys wait here.
I'm gonna go over there.

741
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,594
He's so strange.

742
00:40:01,501 --> 00:40:02,737
Oh!

743
00:40:05,873 --> 00:40:07,108
Dresden!

744
00:40:14,682 --> 00:40:15,850
Dresden!

745
00:40:15,883 --> 00:40:18,152
Dresden?

746
00:40:18,185 --> 00:40:19,419
-You got it?
-Yeah. Yeah.

747
00:40:23,991 --> 00:40:26,493
-Dresden!
-Dresden!

748
00:40:43,778 --> 00:40:44,745
Can we go?

749
00:40:45,913 --> 00:40:48,448
Oh my God.

750
00:40:50,251 --> 00:40:51,652
Don't come ever
do that again.

751
00:40:54,155 --> 00:40:55,690
What?
What did I do?

752
00:41:03,664 --> 00:41:04,598
Better than dealing
with the roads, huh?

753
00:41:04,632 --> 00:41:05,933
Yeah.

754
00:41:05,967 --> 00:41:07,702
We lost some time,
but not too much.

755
00:41:07,735 --> 00:41:09,036
We should be up on the edge
of the park soon.

756
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,604
Once we get past
the bank up here,

757
00:41:10,638 --> 00:41:12,707
we should be at
the outside perimeter.

758
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,942
The plane's on the
other side of those trees.

759
00:41:14,976 --> 00:41:17,611
There's a fence over there,
but we can figure it out.

760
00:41:17,645 --> 00:41:19,213
That's great.
We're coming in further south.

761
00:41:19,246 --> 00:41:20,014
We're gonna have to drive
a little bit north

762
00:41:20,047 --> 00:41:21,716
to get to the plane.

763
00:41:21,749 --> 00:41:22,482
Good job, Richards.

764
00:41:23,751 --> 00:41:24,719
Thank you, sir.

765
00:41:27,755 --> 00:41:29,724
Okay.

766
00:41:29,757 --> 00:41:30,825
Over here.

767
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,228
Come on.

768
00:41:50,111 --> 00:41:53,547
Hi, how you doing?

769
00:41:53,581 --> 00:41:55,049
I'm Dresden Anderson.

770
00:41:55,082 --> 00:41:56,784
I'm with the National Security
Council,

771
00:41:56,817 --> 00:41:59,754
Disaster Division.

772
00:41:59,787 --> 00:42:01,989
I got orders from
General West, D.C.

773
00:42:06,694 --> 00:42:09,997
This is my sister,
Dr. Milly Anderson,

774
00:42:10,031 --> 00:42:13,067
and her colleague, Peter.

775
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:17,304
They're seismologists from NEIC.

776
00:42:17,338 --> 00:42:20,908
Look.
We just need to get through.

777
00:42:20,941 --> 00:42:23,177
We lost their
central control tower.

778
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,780
We need a secure
internet connection.

779
00:42:25,813 --> 00:42:28,783
We need to log back
into the NSA server.

780
00:42:28,816 --> 00:42:30,684
Please, just let us through.

781
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,690
Look, I know how this sounds,

782
00:42:36,724 --> 00:42:38,993
but we're part of
a weapons operation

783
00:42:39,026 --> 00:42:44,298
to stop plate movement,
to avoid global devastation.

784
00:42:44,331 --> 00:42:46,667
So maybe you could talk
to a superior

785
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,270
or maybe give
someone our names or...

786
00:42:49,303 --> 00:42:51,972
something you can do.

787
00:42:59,246 --> 00:43:01,115
It's okay.
We got hit, too.

788
00:43:01,148 --> 00:43:02,716
We're moving to
a secure location.

789
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,285
You can jump in one of
the vans out back.

790
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:07,855
Thank you. I guess our
reputation precedes us.

791
00:43:07,888 --> 00:43:09,090
Let's go.

792
00:43:14,295 --> 00:43:15,262
Still no service.

793
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:19,834
There's no way
I could have gotten

794
00:43:19,867 --> 00:43:20,901
everyone out that plane
without you.

795
00:43:20,935 --> 00:43:22,703
Thank you.

796
00:43:22,736 --> 00:43:24,872
I grew up with my father
in the military

797
00:43:24,905 --> 00:43:29,043
and my mother is a genius, so...
little disaster oriented.

798
00:43:29,076 --> 00:43:34,315
Speaking of, my dad
is supposed to be coming, but...

799
00:43:34,348 --> 00:43:35,316
But I don't see anybody
getting to us here.

800
00:43:35,349 --> 00:43:36,917
They're coming, okay?

801
00:43:36,951 --> 00:43:39,253
Just... we just gotta
hang tight a little longer.

802
00:43:39,286 --> 00:43:41,388
And wait?
For another earthquake

803
00:43:41,422 --> 00:43:43,257
or for the Earth
to open up again?

804
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,392
We might not get
so lucky next time.

805
00:43:45,426 --> 00:43:49,096
-Okay.
-We need to be realistic.

806
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:51,198
We need to find a
safe place to stay tonight.

807
00:43:51,232 --> 00:43:53,667
We're already running
out of food...

808
00:43:53,701 --> 00:43:54,635
And water.

809
00:43:58,038 --> 00:44:00,875
My mom's in the NEIC.

810
00:44:00,908 --> 00:44:02,276
She kind of specializes
in this kind of stuff.

811
00:44:05,379 --> 00:44:07,348
But we can't leave them.

812
00:44:07,381 --> 00:44:09,683
I have to stay here
with the injured.

813
00:44:13,254 --> 00:44:16,724
Everyone, everyone listen.

814
00:44:16,757 --> 00:44:19,293
We've made it this far,
but we need food and water.

815
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:22,363
And the safest thing we can
do is stay here and shelter

816
00:44:22,396 --> 00:44:24,765
while Sophie here
goes to get help.

817
00:44:24,798 --> 00:44:27,034
Okay.

818
00:44:27,067 --> 00:44:28,936
I'm gonna find a way
to charge my phone

819
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:31,372
and call for a rescue team
to come and bring supplies.

820
00:44:31,405 --> 00:44:33,073
Good luck.

821
00:44:37,945 --> 00:44:38,712
And thank you.

822
00:44:41,382 --> 00:44:42,716
Be careful out there.

823
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:43,684
Good luck, Sophie.

824
00:44:56,864 --> 00:44:58,866
Yeah.

825
00:44:58,899 --> 00:45:01,335
Peter, are the lasers
up and running?

826
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:03,771
We're running out of time
for it to be functional.

827
00:45:03,804 --> 00:45:05,339
I ran diagnostics and
I think I know what was wrong.

828
00:45:05,372 --> 00:45:06,140
I just need
a little more time.

829
00:45:06,173 --> 00:45:07,775
Okay.

830
00:45:07,808 --> 00:45:09,443
Can you get us on
the USGS server?

831
00:45:09,476 --> 00:45:11,979
Yeah, it can get us
in anywhere.

832
00:45:12,012 --> 00:45:14,982
We need to focus on
where the crust is weaker.

833
00:45:15,015 --> 00:45:16,917
The plate will have
been loosened already.

834
00:45:16,951 --> 00:45:18,452
Let's keep that as a backup

835
00:45:18,485 --> 00:45:21,155
if we can't get
the lasers up and functional.

836
00:45:21,188 --> 00:45:23,023
Okay.
I'm at it.

837
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:26,794
Okay. This will need dressing.

838
00:45:26,827 --> 00:45:28,796
Good to see you, man.

839
00:45:28,829 --> 00:45:31,365
-Who's in charge here?
-That would be me.

840
00:45:31,398 --> 00:45:33,867
After we landed, we were hit
badly by the earthquakes.

841
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:36,003
We lost the pilot
and some passengers.

842
00:45:36,036 --> 00:45:37,271
Okay, we have food and water.

843
00:45:37,304 --> 00:45:39,440
Is this everyone on flight 384?

844
00:45:39,473 --> 00:45:40,975
Yes.

845
00:45:41,008 --> 00:45:42,843
My daughter was on this flight.

846
00:45:42,876 --> 00:45:45,846
-Is it Sophie?
-Yes. Where is she?

847
00:45:45,879 --> 00:45:48,315
She's alive.
But she left.

848
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:50,317
She said you might be coming,

849
00:45:50,351 --> 00:45:52,119
but wasn't sure how long
you'd be with all the chaos.

850
00:45:52,152 --> 00:45:53,387
Where is she?
I need to find her.

851
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,189
She went in that direction.

852
00:45:55,222 --> 00:45:56,524
Okay.

853
00:45:56,558 --> 00:45:58,225
My men are going to help you.

854
00:45:58,259 --> 00:45:59,360
We're bringing in more
vehicles to come get you.

855
00:45:59,393 --> 00:46:01,161
Thank you.

856
00:46:01,195 --> 00:46:03,030
In the meantime, help everybody
you can, all right?

857
00:46:03,063 --> 00:46:04,498
All right.
Thank you so much.

858
00:46:08,335 --> 00:46:10,237
-Richards.
-Yes, sir.

859
00:46:10,271 --> 00:46:12,139
Sophie's not here, but I have
a good idea where she went.

860
00:46:12,172 --> 00:46:14,875
-I have to go find her.
-I understand, sir.

861
00:46:14,908 --> 00:46:16,910
Jacobs and I will
unpack everything.

862
00:46:16,944 --> 00:46:18,279
Find your daughter.
We'll take care of the rest.

863
00:46:18,312 --> 00:46:20,214
Appreciate you.

864
00:46:20,247 --> 00:46:22,449
Call base. Get some more
men brought up here, okay?

865
00:46:22,483 --> 00:46:23,417
Yes, sir.

866
00:46:28,055 --> 00:46:30,391
Okay.
I've got the USGS site up.

867
00:46:30,424 --> 00:46:32,527
Any new updates or at least
anything new

868
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,061
since we've lost service?

869
00:46:34,094 --> 00:46:35,963
Well, it looks like our
data was correct.

870
00:46:35,996 --> 00:46:37,097
The earthquakes are
already devastating

871
00:46:37,131 --> 00:46:38,966
and they're only getting bigger.

872
00:46:38,999 --> 00:46:41,168
Even the Iceland Greenland
and West Coasts of Europe

873
00:46:41,201 --> 00:46:43,070
are taking earthquake
damage now.

874
00:46:43,103 --> 00:46:45,306
Right.
We need to work faster.

875
00:46:45,339 --> 00:46:48,876
Peter, get into the NSA servers
and initiate the program.

876
00:46:48,909 --> 00:46:49,544
We don't have time
to troubleshoot

877
00:46:49,577 --> 00:46:51,345
the offline weapons.

878
00:46:51,378 --> 00:46:53,247
Log into the USGS
and start pinpointing

879
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,885
the weaker areas
of the Earth's crust.

880
00:46:57,918 --> 00:46:59,053
You're sure this
is going to work

881
00:46:59,086 --> 00:47:00,387
with only a few
operating lasers?

882
00:47:00,421 --> 00:47:01,488
It might.

883
00:47:01,523 --> 00:47:02,956
I mean, it's a calculated risk,

884
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:05,392
but I mean, I think
we are working

885
00:47:05,426 --> 00:47:06,528
a little on the fly here.

886
00:47:08,896 --> 00:47:11,465
We have no other choice.

887
00:47:11,498 --> 00:47:14,368
Okay, the Oceanic,
Basaltic areas are going

888
00:47:14,401 --> 00:47:16,303
to be our best bet
because they're thinner.

889
00:47:16,337 --> 00:47:19,006
We could try East Pacific Rise?

890
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:25,145
Smart. New crust is continually
being formed as magma rises.

891
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:27,515
Okay, get the coordinates
for specific rock formations

892
00:47:27,549 --> 00:47:30,484
along the ridge.

893
00:47:30,518 --> 00:47:32,219
It's a mid-ocean ridge system.

894
00:47:32,252 --> 00:47:34,622
The Earth's crust is younger
and more fragile here.

895
00:47:34,656 --> 00:47:36,323
It's on the Eastern side
of the plate

896
00:47:36,357 --> 00:47:37,625
not far from
the original coordinates.

897
00:47:37,659 --> 00:47:39,860
Okay, let's do it.

898
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:43,565
Okay. Come on.

899
00:47:48,335 --> 00:47:49,903
Get a stretcher!

900
00:47:49,937 --> 00:47:51,271
Sophie!

901
00:47:53,173 --> 00:47:54,274
Sophie!

902
00:47:56,143 --> 00:47:57,344
Sophie!

903
00:48:06,153 --> 00:48:06,920
Sophie!

904
00:48:08,455 --> 00:48:10,224
Sophie!

905
00:48:12,694 --> 00:48:13,894
Where are you?

906
00:48:19,166 --> 00:48:21,201
Peter, watch the temperature
and the seismic activity

907
00:48:21,235 --> 00:48:23,170
like a hawk when we fire.

908
00:48:23,203 --> 00:48:25,439
As soon as you see
dispersion activity

909
00:48:25,472 --> 00:48:28,308
from the east side
of the plate, pull it back.

910
00:48:28,342 --> 00:48:30,144
Yes, you got it.

911
00:48:30,177 --> 00:48:32,012
And we need the plate movement
to slow to the point

912
00:48:32,045 --> 00:48:34,549
where it can find
its own rhythm again.

913
00:48:34,582 --> 00:48:38,152
It will settle back into
the tectonic energy pattern.

914
00:48:38,185 --> 00:48:40,154
I mean, if we create
too much heat,

915
00:48:40,187 --> 00:48:42,356
we risk giving it
opposite energy

916
00:48:42,389 --> 00:48:45,159
and end up sending it back.

917
00:48:45,192 --> 00:48:47,461
Which would put us back
right where we started.

918
00:48:47,494 --> 00:48:49,496
-Yes.
-Or worse.

919
00:48:49,531 --> 00:48:51,999
The plate boundaries
are already so volatile.

920
00:48:52,032 --> 00:48:54,368
If we push back
with this much force,

921
00:48:54,401 --> 00:48:59,641
the damage would be tenfold.

922
00:48:59,674 --> 00:49:02,075
But you're going to do fine.

923
00:49:02,109 --> 00:49:04,311
He has to.
We don't have a choice.

924
00:49:04,344 --> 00:49:06,213
Thank you, Dresden.

925
00:49:06,246 --> 00:49:07,414
Okay, let's do this.

926
00:49:07,448 --> 00:49:10,017
Okay, initiating lasers.
Stand by.

927
00:49:18,459 --> 00:49:19,426
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

928
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,528
I lost connection.

929
00:49:20,562 --> 00:49:22,630
The lasers are not responding.

930
00:49:22,664 --> 00:49:24,398
The software knows I'm operating
from a different IP connection

931
00:49:24,431 --> 00:49:26,400
and the internal GPS system
won't allow them

932
00:49:26,433 --> 00:49:28,502
to fire on U.S. territory.

933
00:49:28,536 --> 00:49:30,337
I need to reset the parameters.

934
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:32,039
Okay, how long is
this going to take?

935
00:49:32,072 --> 00:49:33,440
I don't know.
They run on very old tech

936
00:49:33,474 --> 00:49:34,441
Frankensteined together.

937
00:49:34,475 --> 00:49:36,109
Our connection is tenuous.

938
00:49:36,143 --> 00:49:37,344
I'm trying to
overload the system.

939
00:49:37,377 --> 00:49:39,246
Dresden?

940
00:49:39,279 --> 00:49:40,715
We might need to start
preparing for the worst.

941
00:49:42,249 --> 00:49:44,418
We need to override
the onboard GPS.

942
00:49:44,451 --> 00:49:46,420
But how?

943
00:49:46,453 --> 00:49:51,258
If I reroute power and send
the modules into recovery mode,

944
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:55,262
I may be able to adjust
the targeting system manually.

945
00:49:56,664 --> 00:49:58,465
-Here comes another one.
-Get down.

946
00:49:58,499 --> 00:49:59,233
No, not yet.

947
00:50:00,702 --> 00:50:02,102
Come on.

948
00:50:02,135 --> 00:50:03,003
Okay, just give me a sec.

949
00:50:07,107 --> 00:50:08,242
All right, lasers are
online and locked in.

950
00:50:08,275 --> 00:50:10,143
Let's hope this works.

951
00:50:10,177 --> 00:50:12,012
Ready to fire.
Three, two, one.

952
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:19,152
The monitor is blank,
but the power is still on.

953
00:50:19,186 --> 00:50:21,088
Is it still operational?

954
00:50:21,121 --> 00:50:23,257
Fire it.
Fire it now!

955
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:26,326
Come on, come on.

956
00:50:33,133 --> 00:50:35,369
It's dropping.

957
00:50:40,107 --> 00:50:41,709
Okay.

958
00:50:41,743 --> 00:50:44,244
Not opening the champagne yet.

959
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:49,283
What is it?
We lost connection again?

960
00:50:49,316 --> 00:50:51,586
No, we're hitting the target.

961
00:50:51,619 --> 00:50:54,288
It's still not enough heat.

962
00:50:54,321 --> 00:50:56,356
What do you mean
by not enough heat?

963
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:58,292
I don't know why,
but the reading suggests

964
00:50:58,325 --> 00:51:00,795
that the plate is generating
so much of its own movement,

965
00:51:00,828 --> 00:51:02,830
I don't think we can stop it.

966
00:51:02,864 --> 00:51:04,632
Are the rock
formations heating up?

967
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:09,704
Massively, but just not enough
to slow the plate significantly.

968
00:51:09,737 --> 00:51:13,508
And you're sure this is
at maximum intensity?

969
00:51:13,541 --> 00:51:15,309
Yeah, of course.

970
00:51:16,844 --> 00:51:18,613
What happened to
our interval time?

971
00:51:18,646 --> 00:51:20,515
The monitoring software
doesn't know how

972
00:51:20,548 --> 00:51:21,849
to read multiple earthquakes
with multiple magnitudes.

973
00:51:21,883 --> 00:51:23,651
at once in areas
where they normally

974
00:51:23,685 --> 00:51:24,719
wouldn't exist together.

975
00:51:24,752 --> 00:51:25,853
It's unprecedented.

976
00:51:25,887 --> 00:51:28,422
An impossible scenario
until now.

977
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:45,573
We need to move on.

978
00:51:45,607 --> 00:51:47,842
The lasers failed.

979
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:49,476
I mean, I guess we
really have no other options.

980
00:51:51,311 --> 00:51:53,548
Nothing made at this scale
can keep up with

981
00:51:53,581 --> 00:51:54,749
the forces of nature.

982
00:51:57,852 --> 00:51:59,252
So, what if it's not man-made?

983
00:52:03,691 --> 00:52:05,760
If we can't affect the
speed of the plate

984
00:52:05,793 --> 00:52:07,862
by doing something to it,

985
00:52:07,895 --> 00:52:09,797
perhaps we can slow it down
by having it

986
00:52:09,831 --> 00:52:11,799
do something to itself.

987
00:52:11,833 --> 00:52:13,701
I don't follow.

988
00:52:13,735 --> 00:52:15,168
What do you mean?

989
00:52:15,202 --> 00:52:18,271
Think about
the plane crash earlier.

990
00:52:18,305 --> 00:52:19,674
How did it reduce its speed?

991
00:52:19,707 --> 00:52:20,808
They have thrust reverses.

992
00:52:20,842 --> 00:52:22,877
That's after it landed.

993
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:27,214
Okay, in the air that used drag
flaps, spoilers, speed brakes.

994
00:52:27,247 --> 00:52:29,216
Oh, then I suppose they
could try and drop the weight.

995
00:52:29,249 --> 00:52:31,251
They could affect them on them,

996
00:52:31,284 --> 00:52:33,721
But they could only reduce
it within gravity's allowance.

997
00:52:33,755 --> 00:52:35,389
But it still has an effect.

998
00:52:35,422 --> 00:52:37,925
They offload everything
they can.

999
00:52:37,959 --> 00:52:40,928
So, if we apply it to our
model and offload weight,

1000
00:52:40,962 --> 00:52:42,429
we might not be able
to stop the disaster,

1001
00:52:42,462 --> 00:52:44,331
but we could potentially
introduce a slowdown.

1002
00:52:44,364 --> 00:52:45,800
Correct.

1003
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:47,702
We need to get rid of the weight

1004
00:52:47,735 --> 00:52:50,905
that's giving the Earth's
crust this extra momentum.

1005
00:52:50,938 --> 00:52:55,275
Though it's not really
a build-up of weight,

1006
00:52:55,308 --> 00:52:59,847
it is more of a build-up of
pressure at the Earth's core.

1007
00:52:59,881 --> 00:53:02,249
Yes, exactly.

1008
00:53:02,282 --> 00:53:06,319
Peter, remember the
reporter earlier

1009
00:53:06,353 --> 00:53:08,488
who thought there was
an explosion in the sea?

1010
00:53:08,523 --> 00:53:12,459
What if we could somehow
use those oil rigs

1011
00:53:12,492 --> 00:53:15,863
off the Pacific to slow down
this continental drift

1012
00:53:15,897 --> 00:53:19,332
by offloading gas pressure?

1013
00:53:19,366 --> 00:53:21,636
We can buy the world
and us some time.

1014
00:53:21,669 --> 00:53:23,671
It would have to happen at
multiple locations,

1015
00:53:23,705 --> 00:53:26,473
to have any effect on the
entire plate's movement.

1016
00:53:26,507 --> 00:53:31,278
Yes, but there are multiple oil
rigs all around the Pacific.

1017
00:53:31,311 --> 00:53:34,849
And they're already set up,
and near the fault line.

1018
00:53:34,882 --> 00:53:38,653
We could use the oil
rigs like volcanoes.

1019
00:53:38,686 --> 00:53:42,355
Yes, exactly, and we can
actually control that.

1020
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:44,491
Along with its
own destructive path.

1021
00:53:44,525 --> 00:53:47,862
Right. I am thinking more about
the gases in the Earth's core.

1022
00:53:47,895 --> 00:53:49,797
-Like Helium-3.
-Yes.

1023
00:53:49,831 --> 00:53:53,500
It'll rise and disperse into
the atmosphere, harmless gas.

1024
00:53:53,534 --> 00:53:55,469
We vent pressure from
the plate to the wellbores

1025
00:53:55,502 --> 00:53:56,571
on the Pacific plate oil rigs.

1026
00:53:56,604 --> 00:53:58,472
Wow.

1027
00:53:58,506 --> 00:54:01,241
I thought I was the only
genius in this family.

1028
00:54:03,845 --> 00:54:07,949
Helium-3 is attracted
to the heat under the crust.

1029
00:54:07,982 --> 00:54:10,350
If we change the pressure
and start venting,

1030
00:54:10,383 --> 00:54:14,488
that gas is going to move with
a giant amount of force.

1031
00:54:14,522 --> 00:54:17,390
Right.
Speed is our friend right now.

1032
00:54:17,424 --> 00:54:19,894
Don't we have pumps
on those platforms?

1033
00:54:19,927 --> 00:54:23,030
I believe so, yes.
I'll start researching.

1034
00:54:23,064 --> 00:54:24,966
So we use the
pumps on the rig

1035
00:54:24,999 --> 00:54:26,868
that they use for oil as a
way of slowing down the helium,

1036
00:54:26,901 --> 00:54:28,368
controlling it.

1037
00:54:28,401 --> 00:54:29,971
And if that pressure
gets too high

1038
00:54:30,004 --> 00:54:32,740
or when we've offloaded enough?

1039
00:54:32,774 --> 00:54:34,642
I don't think these pumps are
strong enough on their own.

1040
00:54:34,675 --> 00:54:36,778
We need to find a way of slowing
it or cooling it down some way.

1041
00:54:42,683 --> 00:54:45,019
Hello? Hello?

1042
00:54:49,557 --> 00:54:53,528
Miss, please stop.
This is a restricted area.

1043
00:54:53,561 --> 00:54:55,062
I'm looking for my father.

1044
00:54:55,096 --> 00:54:56,764
He's a U.S. Army major.
Anderson?

1045
00:54:56,798 --> 00:54:58,566
We haven't seen
any armed services.

1046
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:00,601
Do you need help?

1047
00:55:00,635 --> 00:55:02,837
Where can I find power
to charge my phone?

1048
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:05,372
There's a school over there.

1049
00:55:05,405 --> 00:55:06,808
It's the only building
still standing with power.

1050
00:55:08,042 --> 00:55:09,777
But you should wait here.

1051
00:55:09,811 --> 00:55:12,312
There's no time.
I've got to go.

1052
00:55:39,472 --> 00:55:40,741
Hello?

1053
00:55:45,613 --> 00:55:46,747
Hello?

1054
00:55:48,082 --> 00:55:50,685
Is anybody in there?
Hello?

1055
00:56:03,463 --> 00:56:04,832
Peter, get into
the Bureau of Safety

1056
00:56:04,866 --> 00:56:06,834
and Environmental Enforcement,

1057
00:56:06,868 --> 00:56:09,637
locate all the
Pacific Ocean oil rigs,

1058
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:11,404
and pull up the
inventory supplies list

1059
00:56:11,438 --> 00:56:13,406
from the last round
of inspections.

1060
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,677
I have their inventories here.

1061
00:56:16,711 --> 00:56:19,013
There it is.
Find the Chemical Directory,

1062
00:56:19,046 --> 00:56:20,815
and filter it by
the largest quantities.

1063
00:56:20,848 --> 00:56:21,782
Copy.

1064
00:56:23,651 --> 00:56:26,120
Most of these rigs have
large liquid nitrogen reserves.

1065
00:56:26,153 --> 00:56:27,822
Imagine that's to
handle emergencies.

1066
00:56:27,855 --> 00:56:29,489
Yeah, that's perfect.

1067
00:56:29,523 --> 00:56:31,125
If you pump the nitrogen
down the wellbore,

1068
00:56:31,158 --> 00:56:32,827
it will cool the helium
on contact

1069
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,829
and stop it in its tracks.

1070
00:56:34,862 --> 00:56:37,098
Then we can pump it back to
regular pressure and seal it.

1071
00:56:37,131 --> 00:56:39,734
Then let's find the rigs
closest to the plate boundaries.

1072
00:56:39,767 --> 00:56:41,636
I mean, that's where
the helium release

1073
00:56:41,669 --> 00:56:42,837
will have the most effect.

1074
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:43,871
Yeah, we just have
to slow it down

1075
00:56:43,905 --> 00:56:45,640
enough to stop its momentum.

1076
00:56:45,673 --> 00:56:49,844
Not too much or will
be in trouble.

1077
00:56:49,877 --> 00:56:52,546
It's risky, but it
just might work.

1078
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:54,048
If we can gain some time,
it's worth it.

1079
00:56:54,081 --> 00:56:56,884
Right, you need to coordinate
with multiple rigs.

1080
00:56:56,918 --> 00:56:58,719
They all need to
vent simultaneously

1081
00:56:58,753 --> 00:57:00,721
if we want maximum impact.

1082
00:57:00,755 --> 00:57:04,058
Same goes for when we start
slowing down the gas.

1083
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:05,660
It has to be uniform.

1084
00:57:05,693 --> 00:57:07,862
We can use the
government satellites network

1085
00:57:07,895 --> 00:57:09,864
to coordinate the timing,

1086
00:57:09,897 --> 00:57:13,500
I mean, as long as these rigs
still have connections...

1087
00:57:16,037 --> 00:57:18,606
and as much
as I hate to say it,

1088
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:22,743
we're gonna need
approval and cooperation.

1089
00:57:22,777 --> 00:57:25,546
Peter, patch a satellite
phone to General West.

1090
00:57:30,785 --> 00:57:32,553
This is General West.

1091
00:57:32,586 --> 00:57:35,556
General West,
this is Dr. Milly Anderson.

1092
00:57:35,589 --> 00:57:37,825
I have my brother still with me.

1093
00:57:37,858 --> 00:57:39,727
We need your help again.

1094
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,096
The only option we have left
to stop plate movement

1095
00:57:42,129 --> 00:57:45,700
is to release pressure
and we've calculated a way.

1096
00:57:45,733 --> 00:57:48,569
We can vent
the built up plate pressure

1097
00:57:48,602 --> 00:57:51,238
from the divergent boundaries
using the Pacific oil rigs

1098
00:57:51,272 --> 00:57:53,574
and the liquid
nitrogen on board.

1099
00:57:53,607 --> 00:57:56,777
It sounds like a one in
a million chance, doctor.

1100
00:57:56,811 --> 00:57:59,747
Well, at very least it can slow
down the plate's movement

1101
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:02,016
and prevent more
catastrophic quakes,

1102
00:58:02,049 --> 00:58:04,952
for at least a few more days.

1103
00:58:04,986 --> 00:58:06,554
It's the only option
we have left.

1104
00:58:06,587 --> 00:58:08,622
We need you to sign off
on our access

1105
00:58:08,656 --> 00:58:10,124
to the satellite network
and mandate

1106
00:58:10,157 --> 00:58:12,727
for a master control
of the rigs.

1107
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,729
We need to reset the schedules
for the pump timers

1108
00:58:14,762 --> 00:58:17,765
and then for
the nitrogen release.

1109
00:58:17,798 --> 00:58:19,934
Okay, doctor.
I'll get you your clearances,

1110
00:58:19,967 --> 00:58:23,137
but the rigs have to be
in state water, not federal.

1111
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:25,773
I can't get clearance
for federal water.

1112
00:58:25,806 --> 00:58:27,708
Peter.

1113
00:58:27,742 --> 00:58:29,210
Uh... Yes, sir.

1114
00:58:29,243 --> 00:58:31,579
I'll get you an
emergency security clearance

1115
00:58:31,612 --> 00:58:33,547
and I'll set you up with
the engineering profile

1116
00:58:33,581 --> 00:58:35,116
and data base.

1117
00:58:35,149 --> 00:58:36,550
<i>Then you can get in and</i>
<i>do what you need to.</i>

1118
00:58:36,584 --> 00:58:37,585
Copy that.

1119
00:58:37,618 --> 00:58:38,786
Thank you, General.

1120
00:58:38,819 --> 00:58:39,820
Thank you, sir.

1121
00:58:56,303 --> 00:58:58,172
Ah!

1122
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:15,089
Sophie!

1123
00:59:15,122 --> 00:59:16,057
Dad!

1124
00:59:26,901 --> 00:59:28,602
All right, I've managed
to reset the pump systems

1125
00:59:28,636 --> 00:59:30,838
and synchronize
the wellbore cycles

1126
00:59:30,871 --> 00:59:34,642
on three rigs
off the Washington coast.

1127
00:59:34,675 --> 00:59:36,944
How long until we can
start extracting the helium-3?

1128
00:59:36,977 --> 00:59:38,646
I'm trying to override

1129
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:39,680
the liquid nitrogen
safety protocols,

1130
00:59:39,713 --> 00:59:41,749
but I'm totally locked out.

1131
00:59:41,782 --> 00:59:43,317
How so?

1132
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:44,618
Pumping liquid nitrogen
into the wellbore,

1133
00:59:44,652 --> 00:59:46,187
is usually a last resort.

1134
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:48,022
It's a safety measure for rigs

1135
00:59:48,055 --> 00:59:49,957
about to explode or
the oil pipeline is buckling.

1136
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:51,725
It stops
a catastrophic spill.

1137
00:59:51,759 --> 00:59:54,295
It protects the ocean
ecosystem around the rig.

1138
00:59:54,328 --> 00:59:54,962
It's not something
that's controlled

1139
00:59:54,995 --> 00:59:56,897
by the oil rigs themselves,

1140
00:59:56,931 --> 00:59:59,233
but the time this protocol
will ever come in a play

1141
00:59:59,266 --> 01:00:03,037
their internal computer system
are completely shut down.

1142
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:05,840
This command has to be sent
from an independent signal

1143
01:00:05,873 --> 01:00:07,975
outside the
oil rig central computer.

1144
01:00:08,008 --> 01:00:10,678
Like a government data center.

1145
01:00:10,711 --> 01:00:13,147
Usually, from a control center
positioned along the coast,

1146
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:15,149
so they have a clear
communication path

1147
01:00:15,182 --> 01:00:17,051
and can send a clean frequency.

1148
01:00:17,084 --> 01:00:18,919
It needs to be able
to send a signal

1149
01:00:18,953 --> 01:00:21,956
in all directions across
the Pacific in real time.

1150
01:00:21,989 --> 01:00:24,058
You're right. That's how
we're going to have to do it

1151
01:00:24,091 --> 01:00:27,194
if we want all four rigs to
act together and identically.

1152
01:00:27,228 --> 01:00:31,165
Starting to sound like
it's not going to happen.

1153
01:00:31,198 --> 01:00:32,900
I've been sending
a test frequency

1154
01:00:32,933 --> 01:00:35,269
to the coastline beacon
for platform Ellen.

1155
01:00:35,302 --> 01:00:36,370
It's not responding.

1156
01:00:36,403 --> 01:00:38,205
Is there another beacon?

1157
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:42,710
There is another one
further the down the coast.

1158
01:00:42,743 --> 01:00:43,944
Like I said, this
is not common protocol

1159
01:00:43,978 --> 01:00:45,446
and this software
on these rigs

1160
01:00:45,479 --> 01:00:47,715
was not engineered
with earthquakes in mind.

1161
01:00:47,748 --> 01:00:49,416
There's a satellite phone here.

1162
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:54,388
We could send
a frequency with that.

1163
01:00:54,421 --> 01:00:56,090
Thank you.

1164
01:00:56,123 --> 01:00:57,892
Yes, but we're too low

1165
01:00:57,925 --> 01:00:59,960
and we need to be out on
the water for a signal path.

1166
01:00:59,994 --> 01:01:03,297
I mean, it's risky, but we might
not have any other options left.

1167
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:06,033
I can't believe I didn't
think of this earlier.

1168
01:01:06,066 --> 01:01:09,303
Peter, can you pull up all
the personnel tracker

1169
01:01:09,336 --> 01:01:12,773
for active military vehicles
in a 50 mile radius?

1170
01:01:12,806 --> 01:01:14,208
This isn't all of them,
just vehicles

1171
01:01:14,241 --> 01:01:17,811
that have a satellite
phone on board.

1172
01:01:17,845 --> 01:01:19,446
All right, it's perfect.

1173
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,249
Okay, zoom in near where
Sophie's plane went down.

1174
01:01:22,283 --> 01:01:24,418
There's nothing out there.
You're just wasting your time.

1175
01:01:24,451 --> 01:01:25,920
Check closer to that ocean.

1176
01:01:25,953 --> 01:01:27,354
Okay.

1177
01:01:27,388 --> 01:01:29,957
I knew it, call that vehicle.

1178
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:31,125
Call the satellite phone.

1179
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,396
Oh my God, it's ringing.

1180
01:01:35,429 --> 01:01:36,764
Never thought I'd be so happy
to hear this sound.

1181
01:01:38,299 --> 01:01:39,733
Come on, Josh.
Come on. Pick up.

1182
01:01:50,811 --> 01:01:52,012
Hello?

1183
01:01:52,046 --> 01:01:53,080
<i>Sophie?</i>

1184
01:01:53,113 --> 01:01:54,415
Mom?

1185
01:01:54,448 --> 01:01:56,951
<i>I'm so glad you answered.</i>

1186
01:01:56,984 --> 01:01:59,153
Milly.

1187
01:01:59,186 --> 01:02:01,021
How did you--

1188
01:02:01,055 --> 01:02:03,023
I love you.

1189
01:02:03,057 --> 01:02:05,259
Sophie's with me.
She's perfectly fine.

1190
01:02:05,292 --> 01:02:06,827
Mom, you're alive!

1191
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:09,263
That's really,
really good news.

1192
01:02:09,296 --> 01:02:10,864
I'm so happy to hear your voice.

1193
01:02:10,898 --> 01:02:12,866
Where are you?
We're gonna come to you.

1194
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,368
Are you somewhere safe?

1195
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:15,869
These earthquakes
aren't letting up.

1196
01:02:15,903 --> 01:02:17,838
I know.

1197
01:02:17,871 --> 01:02:19,507
We're at the NSA base safe.

1198
01:02:19,541 --> 01:02:22,276
Even my brother.

1199
01:02:22,309 --> 01:02:24,411
Dresden's with you? Why?

1200
01:02:24,445 --> 01:02:27,114
Yeah, it's a long story.

1201
01:02:27,147 --> 01:02:30,117
But for now, we need your help.

1202
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:32,286
<i>We started to slow down</i>
<i>the tectonic plate movement</i>

1203
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:35,122
<i>that's causing all this,</i>
<i>but ran into a hiccup.</i>

1204
01:02:35,155 --> 01:02:36,824
We need you to send
a signal through

1205
01:02:36,857 --> 01:02:39,260
to the satellite phone
on your vehicle.

1206
01:02:39,293 --> 01:02:40,261
Wait, what?

1207
01:02:42,029 --> 01:02:44,064
We have a specific frequency.

1208
01:02:44,098 --> 01:02:45,499
<i>I can channel</i>
<i>it through your device</i>

1209
01:02:45,533 --> 01:02:47,334
<i>as long as you keep</i>
<i>this line open.</i>

1210
01:02:47,368 --> 01:02:49,837
It's for a synchronized
liquid nitrogen dump

1211
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:52,306
on three Pacific
ocean line oil rigs.

1212
01:02:52,339 --> 01:02:53,807
The signal needs to be set out

1213
01:02:53,841 --> 01:02:55,909
by the ocean
from a high elevation.

1214
01:02:55,943 --> 01:02:57,211
<i>Can you do that?</i>

1215
01:02:57,244 --> 01:02:59,213
Yeah, I actually
know the perfect spot,

1216
01:02:59,246 --> 01:03:00,914
but it's gonna take about
30 minutes to get there,

1217
01:03:00,948 --> 01:03:02,016
<i>is that enough time?</i>

1218
01:03:02,049 --> 01:03:04,251
No, we don't have a choice.

1219
01:03:04,285 --> 01:03:05,520
I thought...

1220
01:03:07,855 --> 01:03:09,524
Just get to the spot.

1221
01:03:09,557 --> 01:03:11,091
I love you both.

1222
01:03:11,125 --> 01:03:13,060
-I love you, too.
-I love you, Milly.

1223
01:03:13,093 --> 01:03:15,896
<i>Call me on this number</i>
<i>when you get to that spot.</i>

1224
01:03:15,929 --> 01:03:17,532
T minus 30 minutes, and
I'm sending you the signal.

1225
01:03:21,536 --> 01:03:22,803
All right, let's get going.

1226
01:03:25,472 --> 01:03:28,242
Let's contact the rigs and
make sure they're hands off

1227
01:03:28,275 --> 01:03:30,978
so we can override their
systems and start venting

1228
01:03:31,011 --> 01:03:33,515
and contact the foreman
at oil platform Ellen.

1229
01:03:33,548 --> 01:03:35,416
Have them prepped
for our arrival.

1230
01:03:35,449 --> 01:03:37,184
Okay.
What?

1231
01:03:37,217 --> 01:03:39,053
I saw a helicopter
on the way in.

1232
01:03:39,086 --> 01:03:41,155
We can use it.
I'm gonna go find the pilot.

1233
01:03:45,092 --> 01:03:46,827
What, have you guys
never been on a chopper?

1234
01:03:49,296 --> 01:03:50,964
Wait, wait, wait.

1235
01:03:50,998 --> 01:03:52,199
Someone needs to stay
to dump the nitrogen.

1236
01:03:52,232 --> 01:03:54,501
The signal has to be
sent from mainland.

1237
01:03:54,536 --> 01:03:56,904
I'll stay.

1238
01:03:56,937 --> 01:03:59,873
Getting too old to get on
and off a helicopter anyway.

1239
01:03:59,907 --> 01:04:01,576
Are you sure?

1240
01:04:01,609 --> 01:04:05,412
I'm staying and you won't
be able to convince him.

1241
01:04:05,446 --> 01:04:08,048
Good job.

1242
01:04:09,551 --> 01:04:12,052
God, you're stubborn.

1243
01:04:17,324 --> 01:04:21,995
Well, I'm glad I was able to
see you at least one more time.

1244
01:04:22,029 --> 01:04:26,668
Hey, I am gonna see
you when you get back.

1245
01:04:26,701 --> 01:04:28,869
Okay?
Take care of yourself.

1246
01:04:30,471 --> 01:04:31,405
Stay safe.

1247
01:04:45,185 --> 01:04:46,654
This isn't exactly what
I was imagining,

1248
01:04:46,688 --> 01:04:49,123
but at least I can say
I saved the world

1249
01:04:49,156 --> 01:04:50,658
when people asked
what I did over break.

1250
01:04:50,692 --> 01:04:52,627
Not yet, you can't.

1251
01:04:54,395 --> 01:04:56,363
All right, fine.

1252
01:04:56,397 --> 01:04:59,333
Maybe now is the right time to
ask all those awkward questions.

1253
01:04:59,366 --> 01:05:02,035
You know, if this really
could be the end.

1254
01:05:02,069 --> 01:05:03,937
Not the end,
we're gonna be fine.

1255
01:05:12,045 --> 01:05:13,615
We're still standing,

1256
01:05:13,648 --> 01:05:16,016
but we've been having
these quakes all day.

1257
01:05:16,049 --> 01:05:18,553
No structural damage,
thank God.

1258
01:05:18,586 --> 01:05:21,623
It's only you here?

1259
01:05:21,656 --> 01:05:23,991
There are a few
others here, too.

1260
01:05:24,024 --> 01:05:27,494
Everyone not essential personnel
was ordered to evacuate.

1261
01:05:27,529 --> 01:05:29,396
I received
the protocol notifications

1262
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:30,964
and I shut our systems down.

1263
01:05:30,998 --> 01:05:32,166
Great.

1264
01:05:32,199 --> 01:05:34,001
It's set for manual override

1265
01:05:34,034 --> 01:05:36,571
so you should be able
to go in and take control.

1266
01:05:36,604 --> 01:05:38,038
Dresden, do you copy?

1267
01:05:38,071 --> 01:05:40,508
This is Peter,
We're at Platform Ellen.

1268
01:05:40,542 --> 01:05:42,142
Do you read?

1269
01:05:42,176 --> 01:05:44,044
<i>Loud and clear, kid.</i>

1270
01:05:44,077 --> 01:05:46,013
<i>Okay, good.</i>

1271
01:05:46,046 --> 01:05:47,981
Great, we are ready
to start, Milly.

1272
01:05:48,015 --> 01:05:49,183
Do you think
Josh is in position?

1273
01:05:49,216 --> 01:05:50,184
He will be.

1274
01:05:50,217 --> 01:05:51,185
Thank you, Rick.

1275
01:05:51,218 --> 01:05:53,253
This is great.

1276
01:05:53,287 --> 01:05:54,589
We've already walked the other
rigs through the procedure

1277
01:05:54,622 --> 01:05:57,257
and we have control
of the oil rigs.

1278
01:05:57,291 --> 01:05:59,493
I've never seen government
intervention like this.

1279
01:05:59,527 --> 01:06:02,996
What are we talking?
Seattle gonna be flattened?

1280
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:06,500
Multiply that by 100.

1281
01:06:06,534 --> 01:06:09,236
Okay. I see.

1282
01:06:09,269 --> 01:06:11,606
So how long do we have?

1283
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:14,208
We need to do this now.
Are you ready?

1284
01:06:14,241 --> 01:06:17,411
It doesn't sound like
I have much of a choice.

1285
01:06:17,444 --> 01:06:18,178
I'm taking control now.

1286
01:06:31,091 --> 01:06:33,427
I've initiated
venting the wellbore.

1287
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:35,462
Looks good so far.

1288
01:06:35,496 --> 01:06:36,997
It's gonna be venting
for a while.

1289
01:06:40,133 --> 01:06:41,769
Okay, it's looking good.

1290
01:06:41,803 --> 01:06:43,538
The plates
are starting to slow.

1291
01:06:43,571 --> 01:06:45,239
Great, just keep
it steady, Peter.

1292
01:06:45,272 --> 01:06:46,240
Copy.

1293
01:06:46,273 --> 01:06:47,007
Where's Josh and Sophie?

1294
01:06:52,279 --> 01:06:54,248
Talk to me, Peter.
How are we looking?

1295
01:06:54,281 --> 01:06:55,783
Stable, the plates...
the plates are slowing.

1296
01:06:55,817 --> 01:06:59,253
It's working.
It's actually working.

1297
01:06:59,286 --> 01:07:00,254
<i>Let's not get</i>
<i>ahead of ourselves.</i>

1298
01:07:00,287 --> 01:07:02,590
<i>We're not out of</i>
<i>the woods yet.</i>

1299
01:07:02,624 --> 01:07:03,725
He's right.

1300
01:07:14,334 --> 01:07:16,236
It was just a matter
of time before there

1301
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:17,805
was more seismic activity.

1302
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:19,339
We must have disturbed
something with the pumps.

1303
01:07:19,373 --> 01:07:21,275
Maybe we moved
the helium too quickly?

1304
01:07:21,308 --> 01:07:23,578
<i>No, I ran</i>
<i>the calculations myself.</i>

1305
01:07:31,853 --> 01:07:34,622
Right, Peter, turn on the pumps,
try and slow it down.

1306
01:07:34,656 --> 01:07:35,690
Okay, going to 50.

1307
01:07:38,826 --> 01:07:40,360
This is not good.

1308
01:07:40,394 --> 01:07:42,195
The seismic activity
hasn't dropped.

1309
01:07:42,229 --> 01:07:43,463
Usually after an
earthquake hits,

1310
01:07:43,497 --> 01:07:45,232
we get a drop
in plate activity

1311
01:07:45,265 --> 01:07:47,234
before the next one,
but... a break in pressure,

1312
01:07:47,267 --> 01:07:48,068
but it's not dropping,
its rising.

1313
01:08:20,835 --> 01:08:22,770
Tsunami's hitting
Josh and Sophie's location.

1314
01:08:29,777 --> 01:08:30,745
I'm gonna go check it out.

1315
01:08:46,293 --> 01:08:47,528
Sophie, grab a walkie.

1316
01:08:52,734 --> 01:08:54,836
<i>Josh, Sophie,</i>
<i>are you in position?</i>

1317
01:08:54,869 --> 01:08:58,271
Yeah, yeah,
we're here, we're here.

1318
01:08:58,305 --> 01:08:59,707
Copy.
I'm glad you made it.

1319
01:08:59,741 --> 01:09:01,408
Stand by for the signal.

1320
01:09:01,441 --> 01:09:04,277
These pressure gauges
are through the roof.

1321
01:09:04,311 --> 01:09:06,714
I see that and I've initiated
the pump sequence.

1322
01:09:06,748 --> 01:09:08,181
Have they not engaged?

1323
01:09:08,215 --> 01:09:09,383
Are you sure you
manually unlocked them?

1324
01:09:09,416 --> 01:09:11,418
Yes, yes.
I ran the procedures

1325
01:09:11,451 --> 01:09:13,588
you specified before you arrived

1326
01:09:13,621 --> 01:09:15,389
and nothing's changed
since then.

1327
01:09:15,422 --> 01:09:16,557
All right, it's rising
across all rigs.

1328
01:09:16,591 --> 01:09:18,626
-We need to bring it down.
-All right.

1329
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:20,928
Increase the pumps to 100%.

1330
01:09:20,962 --> 01:09:22,597
And drop the liquid nitrogen.

1331
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:23,798
The plate hasn't slowed enough.

1332
01:09:23,831 --> 01:09:27,467
We'd be dumping too early.

1333
01:09:27,501 --> 01:09:29,436
Increasing pump
pressure to 100%.

1334
01:09:29,469 --> 01:09:31,606
Okay, Sophie, stand by.

1335
01:09:31,639 --> 01:09:33,306
In three... two...

1336
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:34,609
These gauges are
about to explode.

1337
01:09:34,642 --> 01:09:35,710
No! No!

1338
01:09:40,247 --> 01:09:41,616
What was that?

1339
01:09:41,649 --> 01:09:42,884
Milly, we just lose an oil rig?

1340
01:09:44,484 --> 01:09:46,621
Yes.

1341
01:09:46,654 --> 01:09:48,422
We just lost one of the rigs.

1342
01:09:48,455 --> 01:09:49,724
Oh my god, we
could lose another one.

1343
01:09:49,757 --> 01:09:50,858
Get out of there.

1344
01:09:56,664 --> 01:10:00,333
Two?
We lost two rigs? How?

1345
01:10:00,367 --> 01:10:02,335
Milly, I don't know,
but we need to leave now

1346
01:10:02,369 --> 01:10:03,470
or we're going to be in
the next explosion.

1347
01:10:03,503 --> 01:10:05,840
Wait, let me think.

1348
01:10:05,873 --> 01:10:07,642
<i>You're the only</i>
<i>one left on the rig.</i>

1349
01:10:07,675 --> 01:10:10,310
<i>You need to get out of there.</i>

1350
01:10:10,343 --> 01:10:12,513
Wait, no, if it was going
to blow it, it would have.

1351
01:10:12,547 --> 01:10:13,948
The explosion actually
relieved the pressure

1352
01:10:13,981 --> 01:10:15,415
<i>and it bought us</i>
<i>some time.</i>

1353
01:10:15,449 --> 01:10:17,317
But Dresden's right.
How much time?

1354
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:19,319
<i>Milly, don't make me</i>
<i>come out there.</i>

1355
01:10:19,352 --> 01:10:21,856
Your numbers were off.

1356
01:10:21,889 --> 01:10:24,458
<i>What?</i>
<i>Impossible.</i>

1357
01:10:24,491 --> 01:10:27,595
I'm sorry,
but they're wrong.

1358
01:10:27,628 --> 01:10:28,930
<i>I don't make mistakes.</i>

1359
01:10:28,963 --> 01:10:30,598
Well, this time you did

1360
01:10:30,631 --> 01:10:32,533
and we don't have
time to argue about it.

1361
01:10:32,567 --> 01:10:33,968
We're here now
because of your mistake,

1362
01:10:34,001 --> 01:10:35,536
so just let me fix this.

1363
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:38,472
We need to finish
what we started.

1364
01:10:38,506 --> 01:10:40,842
We're still here.

1365
01:10:40,875 --> 01:10:41,976
What's going on?

1366
01:10:42,009 --> 01:10:43,644
We're figuring it out, Rick.

1367
01:10:43,678 --> 01:10:45,378
Just keep an eye on
those pressure gauges

1368
01:10:45,412 --> 01:10:47,447
and let us know
if they rise, okay?

1369
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,522
The plates didn't slow.

1370
01:10:54,555 --> 01:10:55,623
I know.

1371
01:10:55,656 --> 01:10:56,991
No, I mean, it's moving faster.

1372
01:10:57,024 --> 01:10:58,526
We lost so much pressure
on these two rigs,

1373
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:00,393
it sent the plate on
a biased trajectory.

1374
01:11:00,427 --> 01:11:02,362
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1375
01:11:02,395 --> 01:11:03,698
Okay, into a new movement cycle.

1376
01:11:03,731 --> 01:11:05,566
It's almost like
centrifugal force.

1377
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,400
The Pacifica plate
has even more momentum

1378
01:11:07,434 --> 01:11:09,737
than it did
before it's pivoting.

1379
01:11:09,771 --> 01:11:12,472
It's going to change
the entire plate projection.

1380
01:11:14,075 --> 01:11:16,276
This is a planetary shift.

1381
01:11:19,346 --> 01:11:20,347
How long do we have?

1382
01:11:24,619 --> 01:11:26,521
<i>Peter, what's</i>
<i>the new calculation?</i>

1383
01:11:26,554 --> 01:11:27,522
<i>Be specific.</i>

1384
01:11:27,555 --> 01:11:28,856
Peter, how long do we have?

1385
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:30,457
There's no data
for this, all right?

1386
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:31,159
It's moving on
a different trajectory.

1387
01:11:31,192 --> 01:11:32,860
Now, we have no data for this.

1388
01:11:32,894 --> 01:11:34,461
<i>We can only study</i>
<i>this in real time.</i>

1389
01:11:34,494 --> 01:11:37,999
Milly, there is no way
to stop this now.

1390
01:11:38,032 --> 01:11:40,968
We need to accept that the world
may end as we know it.

1391
01:11:47,074 --> 01:11:49,577
Josh, stay right where you are.

1392
01:11:49,610 --> 01:11:50,845
<i>I'll call you back soon, okay?</i>

1393
01:11:50,878 --> 01:11:52,814
-Copy that.
-Okay.

1394
01:11:57,785 --> 01:11:58,986
Wait, hold on.

1395
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:01,656
What?

1396
01:12:01,689 --> 01:12:04,025
I can't believe I didn't
think about this earlier.

1397
01:12:04,058 --> 01:12:06,027
What? I don't follow.

1398
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:08,996
We need to do exactly
what they did.

1399
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:10,832
You want to drop a fission bomb?

1400
01:12:10,865 --> 01:12:13,366
No, not a nuclear bomb,

1401
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,570
but something large enough
that acts

1402
01:12:15,603 --> 01:12:17,905
like a nuclear explosion
when it mixes with the heat

1403
01:12:17,939 --> 01:12:20,007
and metals at the Earth's core.

1404
01:12:20,041 --> 01:12:21,776
We need to call General West.

1405
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:27,782
Talk to me.

1406
01:12:27,815 --> 01:12:30,051
We have three hours.
The oil rigs didn't work.

1407
01:12:30,084 --> 01:12:31,986
Yeah, I know.
We've been keeping an eye on it.

1408
01:12:32,019 --> 01:12:33,988
But you have
one rig left, correct?

1409
01:12:34,021 --> 01:12:37,424
Yes, and we need to send an
explosive into the wellbore.

1410
01:12:37,457 --> 01:12:39,492
I don't see how
that's going to help.

1411
01:12:39,527 --> 01:12:41,095
The collateral damage
could be worse

1412
01:12:41,128 --> 01:12:43,097
than the earthquake
we're trying to prevent.

1413
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:44,031
Milly, we can't
control it, right?

1414
01:12:44,065 --> 01:12:45,398
We can't measure it.

1415
01:12:45,432 --> 01:12:47,068
What if we send the plate in

1416
01:12:47,101 --> 01:12:49,003
a completely different
direction, like we did before?

1417
01:12:49,036 --> 01:12:50,938
I think it's time we accept--

1418
01:12:50,972 --> 01:12:55,843
If we don't succeed, the world
as we know it will disappear.

1419
01:12:55,877 --> 01:12:58,913
We have to try
and we must succeed.

1420
01:12:58,946 --> 01:13:00,681
So what are you
suggesting, Doc?

1421
01:13:00,715 --> 01:13:04,151
We send explosives down
the middle of the wellbore.

1422
01:13:04,185 --> 01:13:06,921
This rig?

1423
01:13:06,954 --> 01:13:08,756
We send it down deep enough

1424
01:13:08,789 --> 01:13:12,126
away from humanity
where there is no fallout.

1425
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:14,862
Deep enough where it will
push the volcanic magma

1426
01:13:14,896 --> 01:13:16,931
to the surface and
then we cool it.

1427
01:13:16,964 --> 01:13:19,834
Yeah, with the liquid nitrogen
that we didn't deploy,

1428
01:13:19,867 --> 01:13:21,535
it will freeze and harden
the magma along the plate line

1429
01:13:21,569 --> 01:13:23,704
and stop the movement
from transferring

1430
01:13:23,738 --> 01:13:26,540
from one plate to another,
that's genius.

1431
01:13:26,574 --> 01:13:28,743
Pull up the coordinates
of the rig.

1432
01:13:32,013 --> 01:13:33,547
We're near enough
to the plate boundary

1433
01:13:33,581 --> 01:13:35,182
that with these coordinates

1434
01:13:35,216 --> 01:13:37,652
of the plate's
current movement pattern,

1435
01:13:37,685 --> 01:13:39,553
we can get the chain reaction
we need to trigger the explosion

1436
01:13:39,587 --> 01:13:41,055
all the way down the plate.

1437
01:13:41,088 --> 01:13:42,690
But Milly, it's not
100% stable, right?

1438
01:13:42,723 --> 01:13:43,858
The pressure on the pumps
is still high.

1439
01:13:43,891 --> 01:13:46,060
Rick, gather some
of your workers.

1440
01:13:46,093 --> 01:13:49,496
Have them unload all the
missiles on the helicopter.

1441
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:51,065
<i>Doctor, I'm giving</i>
<i>you one more chance.</i>

1442
01:13:51,098 --> 01:13:52,867
They we'll have no other option.

1443
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:55,870
Prepare to start evacuations.

1444
01:13:55,903 --> 01:13:57,571
I understand, sir.

1445
01:14:05,546 --> 01:14:07,515
Is the device ready
to be sent down?

1446
01:14:07,548 --> 01:14:10,885
Yes, but the maintenance
pods with the explosives,

1447
01:14:10,918 --> 01:14:14,021
they are not set up to
handle this kind of weight.

1448
01:14:14,055 --> 01:14:16,090
We've never sent anything
like this before.

1449
01:14:16,123 --> 01:14:17,925
That's a risk we're
going to have to take.

1450
01:14:27,168 --> 01:14:28,903
How's it looking?

1451
01:14:28,936 --> 01:14:30,571
Pressure's good.

1452
01:14:30,604 --> 01:14:32,907
Keep it steady, Peter.

1453
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:34,108
<i>Looking good on my end, too.</i>

1454
01:14:42,883 --> 01:14:44,051
What's going on?

1455
01:14:44,085 --> 01:14:45,619
We're slowing down.

1456
01:14:45,653 --> 01:14:47,955
It's only halfway
to the detonation depth.

1457
01:14:47,989 --> 01:14:52,560
The propellers out, the engine's
gone into power save mode.

1458
01:14:52,593 --> 01:14:55,196
I'll have to reset it manually.

1459
01:14:55,229 --> 01:14:56,197
I'm going to bring it back up.

1460
01:14:59,767 --> 01:15:01,736
How long?

1461
01:15:01,769 --> 01:15:03,270
It's not returning.

1462
01:15:03,304 --> 01:15:05,139
What do you mean?

1463
01:15:05,172 --> 01:15:08,743
It's too heavy.
The rear engines can't manage.

1464
01:15:08,776 --> 01:15:11,645
We normally bring it back
and work on it here.

1465
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:15,082
There's a second
maintenance pod with a suit

1466
01:15:15,116 --> 01:15:16,784
and tether
that the technicians use,

1467
01:15:16,817 --> 01:15:19,754
but they've all evacuated.

1468
01:15:19,787 --> 01:15:21,956
One of us can take it down.

1469
01:15:21,989 --> 01:15:24,091
It needs to be
tested and prepped

1470
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:25,960
before it's
ready for another trip.

1471
01:15:25,993 --> 01:15:28,229
There's only enough
room for one person

1472
01:15:28,262 --> 01:15:29,563
and a breathing apparatus.

1473
01:15:29,597 --> 01:15:31,165
The oxygen tanks
are only half full.

1474
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:31,966
I don't think it
would be smart--

1475
01:15:31,999 --> 01:15:32,933
I'll go.

1476
01:15:39,607 --> 01:15:41,842
Maybe you didn't understand me.

1477
01:15:41,876 --> 01:15:44,645
There's a chance that you
wouldn't make it back from this.

1478
01:15:44,678 --> 01:15:46,213
This is just suicide.

1479
01:15:46,247 --> 01:15:51,118
I heard.

1480
01:15:51,152 --> 01:15:54,288
I'll prep it.

1481
01:15:54,321 --> 01:15:56,791
<i>Milly, you can't.</i>

1482
01:15:56,824 --> 01:16:00,194
<i>You're not the only</i>
<i>stubborn sibling.</i>

1483
01:16:00,227 --> 01:16:01,695
We don't have a choice.

1484
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:04,198
<i>Milly, I...</i>

1485
01:16:06,233 --> 01:16:09,737
I can't have you guys
breaking down on me right now.

1486
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:14,642
<i>And I'm planning on</i>
<i>making it back.</i>

1487
01:16:14,675 --> 01:16:16,811
All right, let's do it.

1488
01:16:57,918 --> 01:16:59,186
You're getting there, Milly.

1489
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:03,090
Just keep your breathing
slow and steady.

1490
01:17:03,124 --> 01:17:05,326
<i>You're right where</i>
<i>you need to be.</i>

1491
01:17:05,359 --> 01:17:08,329
You're going to push
the hatch release

1492
01:17:08,362 --> 01:17:12,133
and we're going to lower you
down onto the rear of the pod.

1493
01:17:12,166 --> 01:17:15,803
<i>You're going to need to push</i>
<i>the release button.</i>

1494
01:17:15,836 --> 01:17:17,404
The floor is going to drop
out and you should be

1495
01:17:17,438 --> 01:17:20,941
right there
by the manual reset.

1496
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:24,178
Copy.

1497
01:17:30,151 --> 01:17:32,319
You're approaching the other
pod, we're slowing you down.

1498
01:17:34,755 --> 01:17:37,191
<i>Milly, you need</i>
<i>to breathe slower.</i>

1499
01:17:37,224 --> 01:17:40,794
You're burning up
what little oxygen you have.

1500
01:17:40,828 --> 01:17:42,396
This is what
I was worried about.

1501
01:17:42,429 --> 01:17:43,998
She's not experienced enough.

1502
01:17:50,938 --> 01:17:53,340
Connecting
to the second pod now.

1503
01:17:57,178 --> 01:18:00,714
Milly, what's going on?
You're breathing too much air.

1504
01:18:00,748 --> 01:18:03,751
You need to slow down.

1505
01:18:03,784 --> 01:18:06,187
<i>You're going to get</i>
<i>lightheaded and pass out.</i>

1506
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:08,822
<i>Stay with us.</i>

1507
01:18:08,856 --> 01:18:11,759
<i>Milly, your family</i>
<i>is counting on you.</i>

1508
01:18:11,792 --> 01:18:12,693
<i>Stay with us.</i>

1509
01:18:16,096 --> 01:18:17,231
I'm on top of the other pod.

1510
01:18:17,264 --> 01:18:19,867
<i>Milly, you have the key.</i>

1511
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:23,704
Use your right hand to reach
into your pocket and grab it.

1512
01:18:30,444 --> 01:18:33,147
You need to insert
the manual reset key

1513
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:36,116
<i>and turn it one revolution.</i>

1514
01:18:40,487 --> 01:18:42,122
<i>Hold on, Milly.</i>
<i>Just hold on.</i>

1515
01:18:46,994 --> 01:18:49,296
<i>She needs oxygen.</i>

1516
01:18:49,330 --> 01:18:50,464
The body is going
into a state similar

1517
01:18:50,497 --> 01:18:52,433
to nitrogen narcosis.

1518
01:18:52,466 --> 01:18:54,435
<i>She's going to get</i>
<i>lightheaded feel euphoric,</i>

1519
01:18:54,468 --> 01:18:56,403
<i>and her short-term memory</i>
<i>is going to disappear.</i>

1520
01:18:56,437 --> 01:18:57,938
<i>Mom...</i>

1521
01:19:02,544 --> 01:19:04,078
We did it!

1522
01:19:04,111 --> 01:19:05,746
We did it.

1523
01:19:08,148 --> 01:19:11,986
It worked.
We're back online.

1524
01:19:12,019 --> 01:19:13,921
<i>Milly, we're bringing you up.</i>

1525
01:19:13,954 --> 01:19:16,423
Keep your arms at your
sides and stay with us.

1526
01:19:29,036 --> 01:19:31,138
Mom?

1527
01:19:31,171 --> 01:19:32,873
Hold on.

1528
01:19:35,042 --> 01:19:36,343
The explosion worked.

1529
01:19:36,377 --> 01:19:39,013
We need to cool now, drop them.

1530
01:19:39,046 --> 01:19:42,149
<i>Nitrogen</i>
<i>in three, two, one.</i>

1531
01:19:42,182 --> 01:19:43,551
<i>Sending signal.</i>

1532
01:20:04,271 --> 01:20:06,040
Dad, what was that?

1533
01:20:06,073 --> 01:20:07,074
I thought we stopped
the earthquakes.

1534
01:20:07,107 --> 01:20:09,076
I thought we did, too.

1535
01:20:09,109 --> 01:20:11,513
Maybe it was from the rig.
Let's get out of here. Come on.

1536
01:20:16,618 --> 01:20:18,452
<i>I don't know if</i>
<i>she's still with us.</i>

1537
01:20:18,485 --> 01:20:19,920
I'm using the emergency purge

1538
01:20:19,953 --> 01:20:22,256
to bring her back
up to us faster.

1539
01:20:22,289 --> 01:20:24,526
<i>She's about to pass out.</i>

1540
01:20:24,559 --> 01:20:27,061
<i>Her oxygen levels are too low.</i>

1541
01:20:27,094 --> 01:20:28,362
<i>We have to get her</i>
<i>to a hyperbaric chamber.</i>

1542
01:20:28,395 --> 01:20:29,597
<i>We do not have one on the rig,</i>

1543
01:20:29,631 --> 01:20:31,533
but I know where
the nearest one is.

1544
01:20:31,566 --> 01:20:34,468
<i>This is her only chance,</i>
<i>or she's not going to make it.</i>

1545
01:20:34,501 --> 01:20:35,469
<i>She's out of air.</i>

1546
01:20:39,139 --> 01:20:41,008
Peter, I brought her up.

1547
01:20:41,041 --> 01:20:42,309
I need you to meet me and
help her get in the chopper.

1548
01:20:42,343 --> 01:20:44,111
<i>On my way.</i>

1549
01:20:44,144 --> 01:20:45,846
<i>Hold on,</i>
<i>Milly, just hold on.</i>

1550
01:21:04,632 --> 01:21:06,100
Hey.

1551
01:21:06,133 --> 01:21:07,501
Peter... Dresden.

1552
01:21:07,535 --> 01:21:10,137
-Yes, Milly, we're here.
-We're here.

1553
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:12,106
How do you feel?

1554
01:21:12,139 --> 01:21:14,108
-I'm fine.
-Good.

1555
01:21:14,141 --> 01:21:16,644
I thought we lost you.

1556
01:21:16,678 --> 01:21:18,078
Don't scare me
like that again, okay?

1557
01:21:19,947 --> 01:21:24,218
Also, I checked
those numbers again.

1558
01:21:24,251 --> 01:21:29,256
And how did you know
the rig wouldn't--

1559
01:21:29,289 --> 01:21:33,327
Dres... Sometimes you
just know the answer.

1560
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,496
You don't have to wait
for the math to catch up.

1561
01:21:35,530 --> 01:21:37,565
Terrific.

1562
01:21:37,599 --> 01:21:38,600
Oh, it's good to have you back.

1563
01:21:42,469 --> 01:21:45,973
Doctor Anderson, you saved
millions, billions of lives.

1564
01:21:46,006 --> 01:21:48,075
Thank you.

1565
01:21:48,108 --> 01:21:50,344
When you're feeling better,
I'd like you to come to D.C.

1566
01:21:50,377 --> 01:21:52,479
and help us better prepare

1567
01:21:52,514 --> 01:21:54,549
for something like this
in the future.

1568
01:21:54,582 --> 01:21:57,484
-Bring Peter.
-Me?

1569
01:21:57,519 --> 01:21:59,019
And your brother.

1570
01:21:59,052 --> 01:22:01,922
I'll think about it,
but no promises.

1571
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:05,325
Yes, sir.
We'll be there.

1572
01:22:09,997 --> 01:22:11,999
Sophie, Josh!

1573
01:22:12,032 --> 01:22:14,101
Oh, my God.

1574
01:22:14,134 --> 01:22:17,171
Well, I guess that's our cue
to head to the vending machines.

1575
01:22:17,204 --> 01:22:19,674
-Thank you.
-Hey, Peter.

1576
01:22:19,707 --> 01:22:21,308
Uncle Dresden!

1577
01:22:21,341 --> 01:22:23,010
-Mom!
-My gosh!

1578
01:22:23,043 --> 01:22:26,180
Come here.

1579
01:22:26,213 --> 01:22:28,482
I'm so glad you're okay.

1580
01:22:28,516 --> 01:22:31,018
General.

1581
01:22:31,051 --> 01:22:31,985
Major.

1582
01:22:35,422 --> 01:22:37,491
We're here.

1583
01:22:37,525 --> 01:22:39,727
You did it, Milly.

1584
01:22:39,761 --> 01:22:42,429
We all did it.

1585
01:22:42,463 --> 01:22:44,599
Well, I'm going to give
you guys some time alone

1586
01:22:44,632 --> 01:22:48,302
so I'm just going to go down
the hall, but I will be back.

1587
01:22:48,335 --> 01:22:52,507
And you're all going to
be seeing me a lot more.

1588
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:54,975
So I'm going to go.

1589
01:22:58,445 --> 01:23:01,014
How did you know there'd be
just enough oxygen to get back?

1590
01:23:01,048 --> 01:23:03,217
Dresden told us
what you did, Mom.

1591
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:05,452
You're very crazy.

1592
01:23:05,486 --> 01:23:07,054
But I love you.

1593
01:23:07,087 --> 01:23:09,256
Yeah, I didn't know.

1594
01:23:09,289 --> 01:23:12,426
But I couldn't let the world end
with all of you still on it.
