00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:27,934
History proves that as a solution
to every scariest problem...

2
00:01:28,134 --> 00:01:30,201
A lethal person arises.

3
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:33,125
I can't narrate a tale about that person.

4
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:36,666
Because I heard about
him in a series of stories.

[upbeat music]

6
00:01:57,609 --> 00:02:01,670
A cotton cloth from Delhi serves as the
starting point for this series of stories.

7
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,958
It is a rare cotton.

8
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:16,833
Only grown in India.

9
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,200
It's lovely.

10
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:20,916
But I'm sure you are not from India.

11
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,291
Yes.

12
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,558
This cotton is very famous in Europe.

13
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:27,516
But in India, no one knows about it.

14
00:02:28,391 --> 00:02:29,066
What?

15
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:30,266
It's true Madam.

16
00:02:32,975 --> 00:02:34,808
This cotton is from our Talakona forest.

17
00:02:35,683 --> 00:02:38,646
Thriving exclusively in
specific climatic conditions...

18
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,072
This is a rare and
exquisite cotton variety...

19
00:02:44,183 --> 00:02:47,433
Even though nature supports the growth
of that cotton, the government doesn't.

20
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:53,467
However, a person arrived and
undertook the cultivation of cotton,

21
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,064
Eventually exporting it abroad.

I don't know what happened to him.

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,142
After hearing that, as a journalist...

26
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:11,501
I aim to support both the cotton crop and
the man responsible for its cultivation.

27
00:03:12,578 --> 00:03:15,899
It's a rare wild cotton plant which grows
in Talakona region in Andhra Pradesh.

28
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:19,316
It has huge demand but provides less
income for those who cultivate it.

29
00:03:19,516 --> 00:03:22,525
The man who motivated the
tribes to cultivate them...

has been missing for one year
under suspicious circumstances.

Sure, sir. We'll submit the documents.

49

But bringing up an investigation like this
will bring a very bad repute to our paper.

Do you have any idea what you
have researched and written about?

54
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:46,316
Sir, it was just an article about cotton.

55
00:04:46,775 --> 00:04:49,566
It was not just an article,
it was a national secret.

56
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:53,441
Such secrets can potentially
topple the government.

57

In 70 years, the publication of our
newspaper has stopped for the first time.

The PMO has had to
take cognizance of this.

All because of your damn article and you!

Now, just get out of this office. Get out!

No one did. A cotton cloth inspired me.

After hours of investigation, they told
me that I had nothing to do with it.

00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,233
But what they don't know is,
they have entwined me with this issue now.

- Didn't you tell her not to mention hill?
- No, Doctor.

Don't you think before you ask?

How can you talk anything
before a people's leader?

I will dig out this scam completely.

Which scam?

187

You have a number tattooed on you.

188
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,270
It must be a special number.

[tribal music]

204
00:14:33,358 --> 00:14:37,525
There was a peaceful farmhouse on a
10-acre green land on top of the hill.

205
00:14:37,983 --> 00:14:41,066
Beside that was a cotton textile factory

206
00:14:41,941 --> 00:14:45,400
A gentleman who provided
employment for two tribes there.

207
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:51,527
The place had fresh air,
impeccable people, and top-quality cotton.

208
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:55,124
The tribal people considered him as God...

209
00:14:55,324 --> 00:14:57,045
Stop your narration and tell me about him.

210
00:14:58,566 --> 00:15:03,191
The point is, not even an ant was allowed
into the premises without his permission.

211
00:15:04,608 --> 00:15:05,733
Not even an ant?

212
00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:08,240
Let me tell you the introduction.

213
00:15:12,608 --> 00:15:15,275
The way you have held the bow,
you'd miss the target.

214

You have to take the wind into
account and then aim the arrow.

The weapon-wielding hands must find a
reason and the aim will not miss the mark.

You didn't hit the arrow to his bottom;
it hit my ego.

First the Parishad elections, then the MLC
elections and now the Assembly elections.

Not once has our pamphlet gone in.

238
00:18:07,275 --> 00:18:10,858
Is this a temple where even a
piece of paper is prohibited?

239
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:13,983
It is just a cloth loom.

240
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:21,046
Hand-loom garments are crafted
with hands, hearts involved.

241
00:18:21,576 --> 00:18:24,014
It is a cloth woven
out of a farmer's soul.

242
00:18:25,691 --> 00:18:27,316
Indian cotton is beautiful.

243
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:30,733
The place where that is
cultivated is definitely a temple.

you have 300 votes under your control.

Is that what you got from it?

It was a warning as it was just
a pamphlet, had it been a man...

Who entered then?

259

The continuation of that story
happened at MLA's residence.

260
00:19:26,816 --> 00:19:31,816
During my childhood, people were so loyal
that they would take money and vote twice.

261

The inflation is nominal but the
greed has risen exponentially.

Damn! Humans have become very cruel.

How will we get so much money though?

He wants to speak to you personally.

[suspenseful music]

It is called bauxite.

276
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:23,816
A rare mineral.

277
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:27,091
This hill lies in your constituency.

278
00:20:27,358 --> 00:20:30,441
There's a farmhouse on its peak and
two tribes residing at its base.

279
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,358
This information can be
found on Google Maps.

280
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:38,108
But our research says that the hill
contains a Bauxite reserve beneath it.

281
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:47,675
If you can vacate them and give me the
hill, I'll give you three billion rupees.

282
00:20:53,508 --> 00:20:56,966
100 million is your token amount.

283
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,920
Sir, there is another piece of information
beyond Google Maps and his research.

284
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:06,758
A man lives there and both the
tribes honour his words to death.

285
00:21:07,675 --> 00:21:10,508
But he won't bow down to us, sir.

00:21:12,508 --> 00:21:15,241
I am tired of killing
people for my projects.

287
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:19,916
I thought it would be a better deal to
give three billion than taking 300 lives.

288
00:21:20,116 --> 00:21:22,216
- Sir, you are not getting it.
- Shut up!

289
00:21:24,591 --> 00:21:27,758
Don't give me silly excuses when
there's so much money involved.

290
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:31,341
I will make them vacate.

whom you are running an enquiry on?

To stop me from publishing about Bauxite
and revealing the names of your bosses.

If it was about Bauxite,

Ma'am...

322
00:23:52,725 --> 00:23:56,216
Recently my daughter has started drinking
this beverage along with her Yoga routine.

323
00:23:57,558 --> 00:23:59,213
She calls it some kind of coolant.

324
00:24:00,391 --> 00:24:02,225
If a coder like her drinks it,

325
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:06,558
then decoders like us should
definitely try it, shouldn't we?

326
00:24:07,016 --> 00:24:10,058
Ma'am, you appointed me in
Europe as permanent undercover.

327
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,037
And as asked, I have built a network
with all the mafia out there.

328
00:24:13,237 --> 00:24:15,157
Now, all of a sudden you
called me back to India.

329
00:24:15,292 --> 00:24:17,683
Any reasons, ma'am?
Any red flags? Am I exposed?

330
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:19,058
Sit down.

331
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:21,678
Sit!

00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,433
There was an incident at the Goa port.

[ship honking]

334
00:24:28,475 --> 00:24:33,100
The customs officers are
habituated to letting things pass through.

335
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:36,558
This time they let a
container pass through.

336
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:41,266
That container travelled to a
godown situated 75 km from there.

337
00:24:43,766 --> 00:24:45,891
Later, an arms dealer was killed there.

As per the information that we
received from our department,

00:24:53,932 --> 00:24:56,051
It was loaded with
hundreds of illegal guns.

Not only that...

342
00:24:58,188 --> 00:25:01,516
Three weeks ago the same arms dealer
was supposed to supply a consignment...

343
00:25:01,716 --> 00:25:05,058
to Naxals in Chhattisgarh
which was captured by someone.

Considering the wind

There is only one man who could have
taken this shot from as far as 800 meters.

347
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,891

Ma'am, I heard this name
when I joined as a rookie.

350
00:25:40,766 --> 00:25:43,183
But I think he's been inactive
for the last 10 years.

351
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:46,683
But he's been active here
since the last 10 years.

352
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,116
The magnitude of the armoury
gone missing is such that...

353
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:54,572
A whole district can wield a gun each.

354
00:25:58,183 --> 00:26:00,100
He's a ruthless assassin.

But what is he building now?

But ma'am, how can I help in this case?

You have built an underground
network in Europe, right?

358
00:26:10,475 --> 00:26:13,933
Find out why he went inactive from there.

Such is his network.

rounds per second to shoot him.

00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,850
Once he agrees to the assignment,
no matter who the target is,

386

He will surely get his coffin ready.

He's out of your range.

If you want to meet him,

you have to give an Ad in the

The Ad contains the location coordinates.

'Wanted painter'.

That's not a phone number,

Those are the coordinates of an area,
latitude, longitude, and place.

His men would come to that

we can get to Eagle's lair.

And your foundations have a crack in them.

He was scared as soon
as he got the warning.

Now that he is out of the way,

we can dig out the entire 3000

Even High Command listens to me,

Only those summoned by the
Lord may witness his presence.

00:50:39,525 --> 00:50:42,941
When you get the maturity, you will
find meaning in every word that I said.

637
00:50:45,691 --> 00:50:47,275
Stop probing all of them, sister.

638
00:50:48,483 --> 00:50:52,608
The night the destruction happened on the
hill, Venkanna and Penchula were present.

639
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:55,653
Let's go to Venkanna
and ask him on his face.

640
00:50:55,835 --> 00:50:57,726
If he denies it, let us ask Penchula.

641
00:50:58,858 --> 00:51:00,650
Where is your grandpa?

642
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:02,733
He has gone to the shop.

643
00:51:04,691 --> 00:51:06,608
Buddy, I want a secret information.

644
00:51:07,025 --> 00:51:09,445
Did you ever see the man
residing on the hill?

645
00:51:09,645 --> 00:51:12,066
He is my friend.
He used to play PubG with me.

646
00:51:14,931 --> 00:51:15,984
Yes!

647
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:19,016
But he never won.

648
00:51:20,183 --> 00:51:22,516
Beating him in PubG is impossible.

649
00:51:23,391 --> 00:51:24,600
- Buddy...
- Yes.

650
00:51:25,516 --> 00:51:28,766
One Sunday, I was standing beside
a coconut tree as I was thirsty.

651
00:51:33,016 --> 00:51:34,558
I heard a huge noise.

652
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:35,858
[gun shot]

653
00:51:39,516 --> 00:51:40,996
There was a coconut fallen beside me.

654
00:51:45,683 --> 00:51:47,183
The next Sunday,

655
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,551
[gun shot]

656
00:51:54,475 --> 00:51:56,641
I saw the scarecrow's
head blown into pieces.

657
00:51:57,008 --> 00:51:59,642
[gun shot]

658
00:52:06,641 --> 00:52:08,870
Since then, every Sunday, it was routine.

659
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:12,011
I would watch the scarecrow,
the head would get shot down.

660
00:52:13,725 --> 00:52:15,421
- What are you talking about, buddy?
- Yes, buddy.

661
00:52:15,445 --> 00:52:17,566
- Was there someone else living there?
- Govind...

662
00:52:20,558 --> 00:52:24,350
So far, the people you have
met have told you only events.

663
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,475
Story is not a bunch of events,

664
00:52:28,266 --> 00:52:30,225
it is the motivation behind those events.

665
00:52:31,391 --> 00:52:32,871
I'll find the motivation and be back.

666
00:52:38,266 --> 00:52:40,891
What happened to your legs in that fair?

667
00:52:42,016 --> 00:52:46,183
When I see you, I remember the chaos
brought upon by that gentleman.

668
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,766
Go sit at the northeast corner,
I'll feel better.

669
00:52:53,683 --> 00:52:57,016
Hey, Luna. Since you are heavy,
go and sit at the southeast corner.

670
00:52:58,058 --> 00:52:59,558
Jealous!

671
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:02,766
What are you talking about?

672
00:53:04,183 --> 00:53:05,183
Vastu.

673
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:07,933
I've spent thousands of
rupees to learn this.

674
00:53:09,433 --> 00:53:11,100
You don't have to ask me anything.

675
00:53:11,433 --> 00:53:14,266
I'll tell you what I know
and what I've witnessed.

676
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:19,766
I learned Vastu that day...

677
00:53:21,516 --> 00:53:25,225
and witnessed an Action movie.

678
00:53:25,425 --> 00:53:28,492
[upbeat music]

679
00:53:29,683 --> 00:53:33,016
Instead getting him killed in the fair,
why are we here to meet the Vellore Gang?

680
00:53:33,216 --> 00:53:34,775
They have sent us this location.

681
00:53:34,975 --> 00:53:36,992
What's so special about them that
we should come looking for them?

682
00:53:37,016 --> 00:53:40,256
No cop in the surrounding districts has
the guts to catch hold of that gang. Come.

683
00:53:44,975 --> 00:53:49,933
Kadhir, don't wash it.
Blood is auspicious for us.

684
00:53:53,058 --> 00:53:54,766
Hey, what is this public violence?

685
00:53:55,266 --> 00:53:56,641
There's a police station nearby.

686
00:53:57,225 --> 00:53:59,683
The one lying dead is
the CI of that station.

687
00:54:03,058 --> 00:54:06,766
Impressive! Impressive!

688
00:54:06,891 --> 00:54:10,812
This is how the murder should be.
This is how it should be.

689
00:54:11,012 --> 00:54:14,933

Did the agent send the location?

Yes.

Didn't you say even a pamphlet
won't enter your premises,

people per direction, Sahadev!

He is not a fabric that you
have wound him into a coil.

me down will stop the incoming assault.

Spare me and I'll run away.

Run away? Why?

Why is he running like that?

797
01:08:25,891 --> 01:08:29,475
Looking at the set-up,
I think we would require two snipers.

798
01:08:29,516 --> 01:08:32,975
Two snipers are not enough.
We are talking about the Eagle.

Hey, Vikas!

813
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:34,933
That's not vermilion, that's bullet
wound. He has killed all of them!

If we stay here anymore,
he will kill us too. Come fast. Come...

Even the King of a region is a piece

You will be staying here
for the next 24 hours,

If you find a danger sign, that means
it's dangerous to enter the premises.

If you still enter despite
knowing about the dangers,

As soon as I mentioned
Sahadev Varma from Talakona,

01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:50,838
Your PA connected me to you
on the spur of the moment.

Astonishing!

I know what happened in your locker room.

839
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:59,183
If you want me to not write about that,

840
01:11:59,641 --> 01:12:02,050
Then I want something
more interesting than that.

841
01:12:02,266 --> 01:12:07,141
Some wild animals make peculiar sounds
to announce their claim over a territory.

If you don't understand that,
you'll be attacked.

He gave me an opportunity
to escape one such attack.

844
01:12:14,725 --> 01:12:18,085
He asked me to get an inmate, who had been
in prison for the last 10 years, released.

845
01:12:20,225 --> 01:12:23,517
He was, Kali Pratap, the bitter past of
Sahadev who could potentially stop him.

A big influence wants you out.

I believe you are reformed.
I hope you won't kill anyone hereafter.

848
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:37,141
No. I'm going to kill him.

You measure time in dollars,
how can I help you in any way?

Sometimes even with an enormous amount
of money to balance the equation,

851
01:12:48,966 --> 01:12:50,850
you cannot stop the light chasing you.

In other words,
you cannot stop the bullet from his gun.

I should not get any

happened after that.

whole time after being warned?

01:13:24,641 --> 01:13:27,681
Even though the mosquitoes were biting
him, he still didn't leave his ground.

01:13:27,716 --> 01:13:31,058
He was there the next morning as well,
brushing his teeth.

Take this. You might want to get lighter.
There, behind the bushes.

What else then?

Shall we leave and
never disturb him again?

live surgic oil strike...

He should have been there on the hilltop.

1266
01:48:47,350 --> 01:48:51,100
Can't you use your cop skills
and pull us out of here?

1267
01:48:51,350 --> 01:48:53,391
Are you out of your mind, Someshwar Reddy?

1268
01:48:54,641 --> 01:49:00,058
Even the military is unable to do anything
there, what can a police officer do?

1269
01:49:00,266 --> 01:49:02,058
- How dare you call me by my name!
- Hey!

1270
01:49:03,308 --> 01:49:06,058
We are in a cemetery not a meeting.

The pro team smartly tried to
trick the hero with a smoke bomb.

1274
01:49:21,725 --> 01:49:24,016
There was smoke all around.

1275

They marched ahead while the
hero was blinded by the smoke.

Meanwhile,
there was a huge noise and heavy wind.

- Sir, sir, Helicopter

1278
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:42,933
The helicopter has come
to airlift me I guess.

Why would they airlift us, idiot?

It came to airlift the
Godzilla who is inside

The pro team started shooting the
guns protruding from that house.

1282

There will be a delay of one second in
the firing of main and secondary guns.

If you observe that,

1285
01:50:12,808 --> 01:50:14,016
we can hit the main gun.

1286
01:50:15,308 --> 01:50:18,558
Meanwhile, a sniper spotted our hero.

1287
01:50:19,850 --> 01:50:21,183
I got him on my sight.

This is not the right time to talk.

There will be life wherever you are.

The war that comes to us when we are least
prepared are the ones planned by destiny.

1314
01:53:25,058 --> 01:53:30,183
Karma came back to us in the form of a
contract that we undertook 6 months ago.

1315
01:53:30,391 --> 01:53:33,433
- What's the contract?
- Illegal guns are being traded.

1316
01:53:33,516 --> 01:53:36,141
We must interrupt the ones who
are trying to intervene the deal.

1317
01:53:42,431 --> 01:53:43,813
Police! Police!

1318

We should have shot him that day itself.

1319
01:53:46,683 --> 01:53:48,141
He is Suhana's father.

1320
01:53:48,433 --> 01:53:50,183
Why shoot him? Let's stop him.

Back then we didn't know what we had done.

The ones whom we helped
to secure the guns...

1324

They were the same terrorists
who ruined our lives.

1325

If guns fall into the wrong hands,
that becomes an irreversible mistake!

1326
01:54:36,948 --> 01:54:39,558
That incident showed me a man in
him that I had never seen before.

1327
01:54:40,475 --> 01:54:43,183
From that moment he was
not the Sahadev I knew.

Do you know when would the
bullet from the gun stops?

the wielder of the gun.

Blog 18.

Today I'm going to speak
about what I think about you.

1332
01:55:43,433 --> 01:55:46,141
You filled hope in people
with the sound of bullets.

1333
01:55:46,683 --> 01:55:50,941
You made the gun a sign of protection.

1334
01:55:51,141 --> 01:55:54,433
If so many people are
having a peaceful sleep,

1335
01:55:55,350 --> 01:55:58,808
that's because a saviour stands in
front of them wielding a weapon.

1336
01:56:01,183 --> 01:56:05,016
I'm very proud that
that one person is mine!

1337
01:56:06,808 --> 01:56:09,683
The one who creates destruction
with weapons is Evil.

1338
01:56:10,391 --> 01:56:12,558
The one who stops that
destruction with weapons is...

1339
01:56:13,433 --> 01:56:14,467
God.

1340
01:56:26,950 --> 01:56:28,708
Even God is omnipresent, just like you.

1341
01:56:28,975 --> 01:56:34,058
What you are doing is nothing short
of being a God. You are equal to God.

She loved me without even knowing me.

1343

She saw a saviour in me.

1344
01:56:47,058 --> 01:56:48,725
Her belief should not be let down.

1345
01:56:49,725 --> 01:56:50,745
Should not!

1346
01:56:51,766 --> 01:56:56,336
To do that, every weapon that an
unworthy person is wielding...

1347
01:57:01,018 --> 01:57:02,178
Has to be destroyed.

1348
01:57:05,058 --> 01:57:08,183
As long as Rachana was alive,
his life was a lie.

1349
01:57:09,308 --> 01:57:11,683
But after her death,
his life found a purpose.

1350
01:57:13,891 --> 01:57:15,933
That made him a warrior.

1351
01:57:17,433 --> 01:57:19,808
I'll do all I can,
to honour her dying wish.

1352
01:57:20,516 --> 01:57:25,516
I'll become what she wished me to be,
I'll not let such tragedy happen again.

1353
01:57:27,999 --> 01:57:31,683
My aim used to take lives,
now it should save lives.

1354
01:57:31,975 --> 01:57:34,909
Every weapon-wielding hand must possess
the responsibility to support the needy.

1355
01:57:34,933 --> 01:57:38,183
The one who does not possess that
responsibility should not touch a weapon.

1356
01:57:39,016 --> 01:57:41,376
Responsible shouldn't leave the weapon.

1357

An irresponsible
shouldn't hold the weapon.

destroy the illegal arms...

people he stopped that night.

02:09:16,850 --> 02:09:20,558
I didn't leave that place,
I left that world.

1417
02:09:26,708 --> 02:09:29,641
There are more than a million weapons
being manufactured every year.

1418
02:09:29,923 --> 02:09:33,308
Country defence purchases only half of it,

1419
02:09:33,558 --> 02:09:36,141
the other half gets sold
on the black market.

1420
02:09:36,600 --> 02:09:39,766
There are more than a billion
illegal guns in this world.

1421
02:09:40,100 --> 02:09:46,141
There are 8 billion people in this world
and there are 8.5 billion guns on sale.

1422
02:09:46,308 --> 02:09:49,183
That means, more than one gun for a life.

1423
02:09:49,558 --> 02:09:53,266
Killing is quite cheap
but protecting is costly.

1424
02:09:55,600 --> 02:10:00,225
If there's no wall stopping this,
no voice condemning this,

1425
02:10:00,391 --> 02:10:02,951
there will be a day when people will
buy guns like they buy mobile phones.

1426
02:10:02,975 --> 02:10:06,141
Wars will take more
lives than any pandemic.

1427
02:10:08,975 --> 02:10:12,141
This must be stopped or I shall stop it.

1428
02:10:14,808 --> 02:10:18,433
Misplacement of a weapon
is the first step towards chaos.

1429
02:10:23,141 --> 02:10:27,314
The guns which entered trains,
roads, hotels, temples and schools,

1430
02:10:28,358 --> 02:10:29,659
Will soon enter houses.

1431
02:10:34,891 --> 02:10:38,600
This nation shouldn't become another
America which has more guns than people.

1432
02:10:44,100 --> 02:10:46,525
When a child leaves the town
for their higher studies,

1433
02:10:46,725 --> 02:10:49,645
they should get a call from their
parents enquiring about their well-being

1434
02:10:50,100 --> 02:10:53,391
but their parents shouldn't receive a
call from that their child is no more.

1435
02:10:58,141 --> 02:11:01,933
When a death happens in a family,
two people die.

1436
02:11:02,225 --> 02:11:06,350
One leaves this world and the
other yearns to leave for eternity.

1437
02:11:06,850 --> 02:11:09,766
Death should not have a
reason but have meaning.

1438
02:11:12,350 --> 02:11:15,641
Gun should mean responsibility
and a bullet, a beacon of hope.

1439
02:11:15,843 --> 02:11:19,691
For that to happen, the weapons should not
fall into the hands of unworthy people.

1440
02:11:19,941 --> 02:11:21,022
Period.

1441
02:11:23,683 --> 02:11:29,433
Do you know how it feels to lose a
loved one to an irrational reason?

1442
02:11:30,191 --> 02:11:32,066
You can't even imagine it.

1443
02:11:36,308 --> 02:11:39,308
The one who causes destruction
with weapons is a demon.

1444
02:11:39,683 --> 02:11:42,183
The one who ceases all
destruction with weapons is God.

1445
02:11:42,891 --> 02:11:46,308
But this God is not noble,
he is very stubborn.

[upbeat music]

1447
02:11:49,891 --> 02:11:54,433
Only I will decide who get these
weapons and where should they go...

1448
02:11:56,766 --> 02:11:58,683
If someone else tries to do otherwise,

1449
02:11:59,141 --> 02:12:02,641
the same chilly night of
the winter will repeat.

You have killed 12 people,

02:13:23,100 --> 02:13:25,808
You are dismissed,
ordering asylum for you.

Within 10 years,
you grew from being a contract killer

1459
02:13:53,891 --> 02:13:56,975
to a Kingpin who controls the
grey markets of the world.

1460
02:13:57,641 --> 02:14:01,600
You got India's powerful
billionaire to get me out.

1461
02:14:03,808 --> 02:14:06,683
Don't live in a fallacy
that I will forgive you,

1462
02:14:06,883 --> 02:14:11,104
because it's not a
memory that you gave me.

1463
02:14:11,475 --> 02:14:12,517
It was a scar.

1464
02:14:13,933 --> 02:14:15,475
I stand in front of you.

Get me.

1466
02:14:20,600 --> 02:14:23,683
You should not die to a bullet.

1467
02:14:35,391 --> 02:14:38,104
You separated a father and his daughter,

1468
02:14:38,488 --> 02:14:43,264
You ruined many lives and
still continue to wreak havoc.

1469
02:15:05,141 --> 02:15:08,183
I will turn back your 10 years of life,

1470
02:15:11,225 --> 02:15:14,308
send back all the weapons
to their original place,

1471
02:15:16,558 --> 02:15:20,433
and bury down your ambitions right here.

1472
02:15:30,225 --> 02:15:35,100
12 intelligence bureaus,
16 governments couldn't stop me,

1473
02:15:35,225 --> 02:15:36,766
How do you think you can do that?

1474
02:15:37,516 --> 02:15:40,225
I've never backed out of any
contract that I undertake.

1475
02:15:40,516 --> 02:15:45,433
This contract is my wife's dream,
it's a lifetime contract.

1476
02:15:50,058 --> 02:15:53,566
Let the entire country come and
stand against me, I'll still stop them.

1477
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:55,048
Come.

1478
02:16:49,891 --> 02:16:53,333
So far, you lived for vengeance but
now onwards you should live for love.

1479
02:16:53,533 --> 02:16:56,975
The loving father within you should
hopefully look forward to each day.

1480
02:16:59,100 --> 02:17:04,266
I have nothing to look forward to...

1481
02:17:06,100 --> 02:17:08,944
When I hit a shot, it's business.

1482
02:17:10,787 --> 02:17:13,601
When I miss a shot, it's purpose.

1483

a life has been waiting for you.

[suspenseful music]

1485
02:17:32,100 --> 02:17:37,225
Sahadev took a decision that no one
could take to correct his mistake.

1486
02:17:38,516 --> 02:17:41,641
That decision brings your book to an end.

1487
02:17:43,225 --> 02:17:46,600
Only one can explain that decision to you.

Who is that slice of life that has
been waiting for me for 10 years?

Pause your game and get to the point.

What are you waiting for?
Will you just stand here?

1499
02:18:55,108 --> 02:18:56,433
What took you so long?

1500
02:18:56,633 --> 02:18:58,850
Her name is Bhoomi. Sahadev's favour.

1501
02:18:59,266 --> 02:19:00,391
Your daughter.

1502
02:19:01,016 --> 02:19:04,141
Right from addressing her to raising
her... She remembers only you.

1503
02:19:06,516 --> 02:19:10,975
Bhoomi is the price he paid to
you for the damage caused by him.

1504
02:19:15,641 --> 02:19:19,641
A father like you who treats his
daughter as his world, is his guarantee.

1505
02:19:26,391 --> 02:19:28,663
God sends a cyclone to uproot a tree.

1506

The same God sends rains
helping it to sprout back again.

1507
02:19:31,348 --> 02:19:32,710
Before Rachana died,

1508
02:19:32,910 --> 02:19:36,220
She presented Sahadev their
symbol of love... their daughter.

1509
02:19:39,266 --> 02:19:45,600
The girl has had a happy life so far,
but she treats you as her father.

1510
02:19:45,933 --> 02:19:51,766
You were always with her. The form and
memory she knows of her father is yours.

1511
02:19:52,266 --> 02:19:56,141
He distanced himself as a
father and gave you a daughter.

1512
02:20:02,183 --> 02:20:04,441
I started this for my daughter.

1513
02:20:04,641 --> 02:20:08,183
But when I found out that he
sacrificed his daughter for me,

1514
02:20:08,475 --> 02:20:13,266
all my vengeance and anger got belittled.

1515
02:20:14,100 --> 02:20:16,411
Everything vanished that second.

1516
02:20:18,405 --> 02:20:19,891
I saw my daughter once again.

He communicated to them that no
missile was necessary to stop him.

1525
02:21:07,733 --> 02:21:11,058
He made the decision to
destroy his place by himself.

02:21:13,295 --> 02:21:18,066
He activated the detonator powerful
enough to impact a 100 metre radius.

could not believe that he was dead.

Is this the fate for someone so stubborn?

We didn't find any remains of his
body in that dilapidated farmhouse.

He planned a decade-long mission,
won't he plan his exit too?

I didn't believe in it either,
just like you don't.

On the next day after the blast,
I went out in search of Eagle and his men.

02:23:24,752 --> 02:23:25,972
Only then I understood.

- He is not a single man.

He altered the definition of the weapon.

A weapon isn't about taking lives;

it's a tool for leading
people onto the right path.

hope to the handloom workers.

1569
02:26:18,725 --> 02:26:21,850
They are the heroes who are
going to handle future dangers.

1570
02:26:23,475 --> 02:26:27,808
The future heroes should be
aware of the present heroes.

1571
02:26:42,808 --> 02:26:43,923
Sahadev...

1572
02:26:45,233 --> 02:26:49,766
If you try to stop a disaster,
you shall be its first victim.

1573
02:26:50,566 --> 02:26:52,281
This is the war you called for.

1574
02:27:00,458 --> 02:27:01,733
Get ready.

1575
02:27:02,204 --> 02:27:03,498
I'm coming.

1576
02:27:06,208 --> 02:27:07,600
The war has begun.

1577
02:27:12,560 --> 02:27:16,225
What you know is just the
middle part of the story,

1578
02:27:16,475 --> 02:27:19,391
but what happened at the start of
this story is pure catastrophe.

1579
02:27:29,183 --> 02:27:33,475
And the end of this story
will witness obliteration!

1580
02:28:10,850 --> 02:28:13,516
Mom, I like this superhero story.

1581
02:28:14,433 --> 02:28:17,600
He came like a shadow and took
away all the weapons with him.

1582
02:28:18,350 --> 02:28:19,433
Did you read about him?

1583
02:28:20,730 --> 02:28:21,735
Yes, I did.

1584
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:24,933
But, Mom... Why did he choose India?

1585
02:28:25,558 --> 02:28:29,766
He didn't choose India,
he started his mission from India.

1586
02:29:49,262 --> 02:29:51,462
These are the weapons
targeted to reach the militants.

1587
02:29:51,662 --> 02:29:54,223
He trusted us to be sincere
and handed them over to us.

1588
02:30:04,933 --> 02:30:06,183
From where was the shot taken?

1589
02:30:12,891 --> 02:30:14,183
850m.

1590
02:30:14,391 --> 02:30:15,691
It sounds unbelievable, right?

1591
02:30:15,891 --> 02:30:17,850
No, it fits very well
with the tales I've heard.

1592
02:30:18,225 --> 02:30:20,600
Stop your elevations and tell
me about the consignment.

1593
02:30:20,800 --> 02:30:21,592
But why, Sir?

1594
02:30:21,792 --> 02:30:23,409
Even if we chased him,
we wouldn't find him.

1595
02:30:23,433 --> 02:30:25,933
When we think he is in our grasp,
he will vaporize like clouds;

1596
02:30:26,133 --> 02:30:28,483
If you watch from afar he will
spread all over like rain.

1597
02:30:28,683 --> 02:30:31,600
Because of him, the mafia and
rowdy-sheeters are finding no weapons

1598
02:30:31,800 --> 02:30:33,560
which has drastically
reduced the crime rate.

1599
02:30:33,933 --> 02:30:36,766
When he is doing our job,
why should we stop him, sir?

1600
02:30:37,016 --> 02:30:40,141
I say, you should have these
peanuts and just chill.

1601
02:30:41,016 --> 02:30:42,475
Your theory sounds right to me.
