1
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:36,924
You're leaving already?

2
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,226
I haven't even
made us breakfast yet.

3
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,628
Oh, I'm sorry, rabbit.

4
00:02:40,762 --> 00:02:42,530
I got a lot
to take care of today.

5
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:46,366
How much longer are we
gonna have to keep doing this?

6
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:49,537
You said you wanted
to be with me and only me.

7
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:52,774
I do, but it's not that easy

8
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:55,375
Baby, this is so unfair.

9
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,345
I know. You know, but it
won't be like this forever.

10
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,652
Okay.

11
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:07,055
Can you stay wearing that
'til I get back?

12
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,956
Mm-hmm. I'll be waiting.

13
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:15,362
Oh, my gosh.

14
00:03:29,744 --> 00:03:31,411
- Hey.
- Hey.

15
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:33,014
How was your flight?

16
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:34,682
Uh, it was good.

17
00:03:34,816 --> 00:03:35,950
A little turbulence,
but, uh, freaked me out a bit,

18
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:37,118
but it's all good now.

19
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:38,886
So, I'm gonna go to Alan's.

20
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,755
He asked me to help him with
some stuff around the house.

21
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,725
Okay. I'm going to go
shopping this afternoon, so.

22
00:03:43,858 --> 00:03:45,526
Okay. Well, just be here
at 6:00.

23
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,961
Reservation is at 8:30, okay?

24
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:48,495
Oh, if you see Lydia,

25
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,131
please tell her not
to overdress tonight.

26
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,200
Every time she does,
I feel like a complete slob.

27
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,770
Sweetie, you can never look
like a slob, even if you tried.

28
00:03:59,941 --> 00:04:03,177
Hey, tell me what you think.
Does this go with that?

29
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,612
No.

30
00:04:06,047 --> 00:04:08,415
Oh, I know the perfect one.

31
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,286
Yes, that's it.

32
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:16,190
So, did your boy toy
come over last night?

33
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:19,493
Honey, he is so much more
than a boy toy.

34
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:20,962
You sure about that?

35
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:22,730
Because he mainly
comes over at night.

36
00:04:22,864 --> 00:04:25,298
Well, that is because
the sex is incredible

37
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,235
And not because
he's hiding from his wife?

38
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,070
Okay. There's that too.

39
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,572
You are the only one

40
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:32,974
that I can talk
to about this stuff.

41
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:35,510
Thank you for not judging me.

42
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:37,277
Oh, girl,
all your skeletons are hidden

43
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,546
in the depths of my soul.

44
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:41,314
No, but seriously.

45
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,017
It's not like
I wanna be a homewrecker

46
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:45,686
or a husband stealer,
or whatever you call it.

47
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,655
The other woman. I mean,
that's what you call it.

48
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:49,157
At least,
that's my term of reference.

49
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,558
It's a little more discreet.

50
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:52,693
I fell in love
with a married man.

51
00:04:52,827 --> 00:04:54,796
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God!

52
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:56,864
That sounds terrible
when you say it out loud.

53
00:04:56,998 --> 00:04:58,065
What's her name?

54
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,836
Ugh. Celine. Celine Castillo.

55
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,706
-This one?
-Mm-hmm.

56
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,974
Girl, she's flan

57
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:09,010
and you're....

58
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:13,915
Seriously,
you tell anyone, kick your ass.

59
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:15,216
Never talk to you again.

60
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,851
I ain't gonna be
no snitch, man.

61
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:21,088
I ain't saying a word.
That good in bed, huh?

62
00:05:21,222 --> 00:05:22,924
Like you wouldn't believe, man.

63
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:26,393
Yo, you wouldn't leave Celine
for this girl, right?

64
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:28,296
No. No. I-- I-- I love Celine,

65
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:32,133
but, uh, I think
I'm falling for this girl.

66
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:36,037
Things are just getting
so intense.

67
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,872
I don't know how to stop it.

68
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,340
And to be honest, I--
I don't know if I want it to.

69
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:43,311
Yo, when you get caught,

70
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,046
don't come crying to me.

71
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,181
Shut up. I don't even want
to think about that, all right?

72
00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:48,883
All right, bro.

73
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,385
I love the dress.

74
00:05:54,856 --> 00:05:56,290
I can't wait
to wear it tonight.

75
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:57,758
You like it?

76
00:06:00,962 --> 00:06:02,530
All right.
Well, I'm out of here.

77
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:04,899
-Where you going?
-To buy my wife a dress.

78
00:06:15,276 --> 00:06:16,744
I would
like to propose to toast.

79
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:19,513
- Yeah.
- To our beautiful wives

80
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,216
for choosing us lucky bastards.

81
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,587
That's sweet.

82
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:28,122
<i>-Salud.</i>
<i>-Salud.</i>

83
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:32,593
So, what's new with you?

84
00:06:32,727 --> 00:06:36,429
So, I have
an ovulation calendar

85
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:37,732
and reminder set on my phone.

86
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:39,667
I mean, we're going for it.

87
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,703
Like, we're really trying
the old-fashioned way first.

88
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:45,072
And if that doesn't work,
I'll look into IVF.

89
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:47,308
I think he's gonna be
a great father.

90
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:50,144
Yeah.

91
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:54,982
Yeah, I don't know if we--

92
00:06:55,116 --> 00:06:56,550
Like 15 times.

93
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:59,687
She's wearing my dress.

94
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,924
Don't worry about it.
You're wearing it better.

95
00:07:09,864 --> 00:07:11,431
Can I get you started
with some drinks?

96
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:14,335
Yes. I will have
a tall glass of Chardonnay.

97
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:15,736
Okay.

98
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:28,950
Oh, my God! Baby!
It's perfect. I love it.

99
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,319
I can't wait to wear it.

100
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:32,787
Well, I saw that dress

101
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,322
and I immediately
thought of you.

102
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,057
It belongs on these curves.

103
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:41,429
Um, I'll be right back.

104
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:42,630
I'm gonna head to the restroom.

105
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:43,998
I'll go with you.

106
00:07:53,374 --> 00:07:54,976
You know what, I'm actually--

107
00:07:55,109 --> 00:07:56,711
I'm gonna freshen up really
quick. I'll be right back.

108
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:58,512
-Take your time.
-Thank you.

109
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:10,658
Caleb!

110
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,261
You're on a date?

111
00:08:14,395 --> 00:08:16,163
Are you kidding me right now?

112
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:18,065
You are literally wining
and dining with your wife.

113
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,267
-Shh!
-What am I supposed to do?

114
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:23,337
You want me to just
sit at home waiting for you?

115
00:08:24,205 --> 00:08:27,141
You know what, Caleb?
You can fix her up like me,

116
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:28,576
you can dress her like me,

117
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:31,112
but she's never
gonna fuck you like I do

118
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:33,481
because that's all
I am to you, isn't it?

119
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:34,882
I'm just a good fuck.

120
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:37,084
No, Fiona. I love you, okay?

121
00:08:37,752 --> 00:08:39,387
You love me?

122
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,655
Well then,
I'm gonna go tell her.

123
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,157
No, no. Do not
cause a scene like this.

124
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,959
Not like this. Please.

125
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,395
Do you wanna
leave your wife or not?

126
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:48,929
It's really so simple.

127
00:08:49,063 --> 00:08:50,831
But if you keep
lying to me, Caleb,

128
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:53,567
I swear, I will
make your life miserable.

129
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,105
Just not tonight, please,
all right?

130
00:08:58,239 --> 00:09:00,908
Please, please
don't say anything.

131
00:09:02,143 --> 00:09:03,944
Just go.

132
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:14,255
Tonight was fun.
I think we needed that.

133
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,590
Ah, I had so much fun.

134
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,794
We need to do
date nights more often.

135
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:22,263
Hm. Like we used to?

136
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,400
Yeah. You looked
so beautiful tonight.

137
00:09:26,535 --> 00:09:29,136
Mm-hmm. What about now?

138
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,337
Extremely.

139
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:05,139
You wouldn't text me back
and I just had to come see you.

140
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:07,608
Well, guess what?

141
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:10,077
She's gonna be outta town
for the next few days and--

142
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:11,513
- Unbelievable.
- Fiona.

143
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:13,114
Look, I know you think

144
00:10:13,247 --> 00:10:15,049
you're getting the short end
of the stick here.

145
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:17,151
You're right. I am getting
the short end of the stick.

146
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,020
You're just stringing me along
and you know it.

147
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:22,591
No, we're done, Caleb.

148
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:23,791
No. Come here. Come here.

149
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:25,025
-Fiona, come here.
-No.

150
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,627
This is
the honest to God truth.

151
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,597
I am in love with you

152
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:31,198
and I don't wanna lose you,
all right?

153
00:10:31,332 --> 00:10:32,800
Look, give me two months

154
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:34,435
to do what I gotta do
and take care of

155
00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:36,704
what I gotta take care of
and I will leave her.

156
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:41,175
I wanna start a life with you.
And I mean that, Fiona.

157
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,081
Two months.

158
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:49,016
Two months.

159
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,054
I don't know why,

160
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:58,092
but I think
you're for real this time.

161
00:10:58,225 --> 00:10:59,093
I am.

162
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:01,162
Just don't let me down, Caleb.

163
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:02,796
I promise I won't.

164
00:11:04,465 --> 00:11:08,802
Oh, my God, baby.
This is the best news ever.

165
00:11:09,504 --> 00:11:11,138
But if you're lying to me,

166
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:14,975
I swear I will never
speak to you again.

167
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:16,677
Honest to God truth.

168
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:20,948
And for the record,

169
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:22,449
I was so jealous
of your date that night.

170
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:23,717
I wanted to kill him.

171
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,119
Oh, is that so?

172
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:26,820
-Mm-hmm.
-Well, don't worry.

173
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:28,689
I didn't fuck him
in my new dress.

174
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:30,491
You better not have

175
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:31,892
I took it off first.

176
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:33,994
-Oh, I probably deserve that.
-Mm-hmm.

177
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:36,030
And you deserve this.
I'm gonna tickle you now.

178
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:37,566
Come here. Get over here.

179
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,066
Stop it!
No! You know I hate that.

180
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,802
Stop! Baby, please.
I'm gonna kick your ass.

181
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:47,441
I'm letting you know
I hate that.

182
00:11:47,576 --> 00:11:49,076
I know.

183
00:11:51,312 --> 00:11:52,379
Come get me.

184
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:37,091
All right,
we're gonna have some fun.

185
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:38,826
We're gonna have some wine,
some cheese.

186
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,528
-Some carrots.
-Some carrots.

187
00:12:40,662 --> 00:12:42,896
We're gonna have some carrots
for your bad eyesight.

188
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:47,034
They can't be that bad.
I chose you.

189
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:49,470
That's true. Actually,
you have great eyesight.

190
00:12:50,572 --> 00:12:52,973
All right, let's do this.

191
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:58,445
So does my rabbit, uh,
have her carrots for the day?

192
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:01,849
You'll always tease me
about eating them.

193
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,350
Well, besides the obvious,

194
00:13:03,484 --> 00:13:05,019
there's a second reason
why I call you that.

195
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:06,854
Oh? You don't even
know the real reason

196
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:08,022
why I eat them so much.

197
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:09,557
Duh.

198
00:13:09,691 --> 00:13:12,960
No, dummy.
For the beta carotene.

199
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:14,795
'Cause if I have
at least two a day,

200
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,731
it makes my skin a glow.

201
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:19,668
See? Look. Don't I have a glow?

202
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,103
Your skin is glowing
and your eyes are beaming

203
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:25,674
just so beautifully right now.

204
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,709
You know, it's the first thing
I noticed about you, right?

205
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:31,546
Mm. You know, the first thing
I noticed were these.

206
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,718
Oh, sorry.

207
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,586
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

208
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,354
No worries.

209
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:42,890
So, uh, what are
we making tonight?

210
00:13:43,658 --> 00:13:45,560
-Excuse me?
-Oh, let me rephrase that.

211
00:13:45,694 --> 00:13:47,928
I meant what are you
making tonight?

212
00:13:48,062 --> 00:13:49,531
Oh, uh, nothing crazy.

213
00:13:49,664 --> 00:13:51,098
Just some quinoa shells

214
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,167
and chicken broth
and tomato paste.

215
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,235
It's kinda like
a healthy version of fideo.

216
00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:56,738
You know,
tomato paste can actually

217
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,205
help smooth out cellulite

218
00:13:58,339 --> 00:13:59,808
'cause it has high amounts
of lycopene.

219
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,076
Wow. No, I did not know that.

220
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:03,778
Okay. That was too much.

221
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:04,912
What are you making?

222
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,480
Uh, spaghetti Bolognese.

223
00:14:06,614 --> 00:14:09,083
-Spaghetti Bolognese. Oh!
-Bolognese. Sorry.

224
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:10,484
Wow, master chef.

225
00:14:10,618 --> 00:14:12,186
Well, it's not
like I make my pasta

226
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,521
from scratch or anything.

227
00:14:13,655 --> 00:14:16,023
Oh, I'm no longer impressed.

228
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:17,458
But it is damn good.

229
00:14:17,592 --> 00:14:18,793
I bet it is.

230
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:24,264
Um, well enjoy your evening.

231
00:14:24,398 --> 00:14:25,866
Okay.

232
00:14:39,748 --> 00:14:42,784
Which one is your favorite?
Let me guess. Strawberry.

233
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:47,689
No. I mean, strawberry's great,
but coconut is better.

234
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:56,930
<i>Gracias.</i> I drive all the way
across town for la michoacana.

235
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:58,700
It is the best there is.

236
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,935
Nice. Look, I-- I know
this is gonna sound strange,

237
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:05,005
but, um,
I feel like I know you.

238
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,908
Really? Where from?

239
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,444
I mean, nowhere specific,
but it's just--

240
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:13,782
Hey, listen, I can see
that you're married, okay?

241
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:17,652
and I am not the mistress type.

242
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:20,988
-No. And I'm not the, uh--
-The cheating type.

243
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:22,557
No, I'm not.

244
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:27,961
Okay. Good. Well,
your wife is a lucky lady.

245
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,314
Hey. Hey. You forgot these.

246
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:50,718
Oh, my carrots! Yeah. I can't
forget these. Thank you.

247
00:15:50,852 --> 00:15:52,419
You are welcome, Fiona.

248
00:15:53,187 --> 00:15:54,622
How do you know my name?

249
00:15:55,389 --> 00:16:00,194
Oh, duh. Oh, my gosh. I always
forget that that's there.

250
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:03,964
Um, well, okay, now you
know my name. And you are?

251
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,567
Caleb. Pleasure.

252
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,201
-Nice to meet you, Caleb.
-And thank you for that

253
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,136
lycopene tomato paste
cellulite tip.

254
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:10,839
I'll be sure to work on that.

255
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,206
-Okay. Yeah, no problem.
-Pleasure.

256
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:13,575
-All right, bye.
-Nice to meet you.

257
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,008
Oh, I'm sorry.

258
00:16:26,554 --> 00:16:28,823
-Okay. You ready?
-Oh.

259
00:16:28,957 --> 00:16:29,924
Show me.

260
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:31,726
Okay.

261
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:39,601
Okay.

262
00:16:39,734 --> 00:16:42,937

Wow.

Congrats, babe. That's amazing.

272
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:04,659
Thank you. Oh!

273
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:07,027
I got you a little gift.

274
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,731
-You did?
-Mm-hmm.

275
00:17:13,568 --> 00:17:17,839
Oh, baby. It's us. I love it.

276
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,975
I'll cherish it
forever and ever.

277
00:17:21,643 --> 00:17:23,443
All right. So, what
do you wanna do tonight?

278
00:17:24,478 --> 00:17:28,583
So, Miguel is having
a celebratory get-together.

279
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:30,384
-Mm-hmm.
-And I know you don't know

280
00:17:30,518 --> 00:17:32,587
any of my friends,
but Miguel knows all about you.

281
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:35,823
Hey, before you
even think it, okay,

282
00:17:35,957 --> 00:17:37,190
nobody there knows who you are.

283
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:38,593
And besides,
we're gonna be together

284
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:40,595
in a couple
of months anyway, right?

285
00:17:41,729 --> 00:17:44,933
Yeah. Okay. Let's do it.
It's your day, okay?

286
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,534
Did someone say more champagne?

287
00:17:46,668 --> 00:17:49,469
-Oh, yes. Please.
-Ooh, yeah.

288
00:17:49,604 --> 00:17:56,143
Well, congrats and cheers
to Miguel and Fiona.

289
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:58,211
Yes!

290
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,148
Oh, that's good. Yeah.

291
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:03,450
I cannot believe you
are here in the flesh.

292
00:18:03,585 --> 00:18:05,218
I've heard so much about you.

293
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:06,688
Your photos
don't do you justice,

294
00:18:06,821 --> 00:18:08,355
but I can see
why Fiona's so sprung.

295
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:11,793
If you're interested,
I have some shoes

296
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:13,360
that could prop you up
about an inch or two.

297
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:16,096
Oh, sorry about
my fashion friends.

298
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:17,732
They're obsessed
with height and looks.

299
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:19,132
I mean, aren't we?

300
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:21,002
Hello, everybody.

301
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:22,369
-Hi, Molly.
-Hi.

302
00:18:22,503 --> 00:18:25,472
Oh, is this your design?
I love it.

303
00:18:25,607 --> 00:18:27,107
It is. Do you wanna buy it?

304
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,810
Maybe I do.

305
00:18:28,943 --> 00:18:31,211
Oh, congrats again on
your new feature in <i>Vogue.</i>

306
00:18:31,345 --> 00:18:32,747
Thank you.

307
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,415
Is this your boyfriend Fiona?
I never met him.

308
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,952
Yes. This is Caleb.

309
00:18:38,086 --> 00:18:39,186
You must be so proud

310
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,622
-of your girl.
-Mm-hmm.

311
00:18:40,755 --> 00:18:41,823
How long have you
guys been together?

312
00:18:41,956 --> 00:18:43,223
About a year now.

313
00:18:43,357 --> 00:18:44,257
Yeah. The best year
of our lives.

314
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:46,094
Absolutely. Mm-hmm.

315
00:18:46,728 --> 00:18:48,596
- Yes.
- Get a room.

316
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,599
Oh, we will.

317
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:53,835
So,
what did you think of Miguel?

318
00:18:53,968 --> 00:18:56,236
He's cool.
What an interesting group.

319
00:18:57,872 --> 00:19:00,207
Me and my-- me--

320
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:03,410
And your soon to be ex.

321
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:05,178
My soon-to-be ex.

322
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:09,282
We, um, we really don't hang
out with interesting people.

323
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,953
You know
my favorite part of tonight?

324
00:19:12,086 --> 00:19:13,186
Mm-hmm.

325
00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:16,090
It gave me a glimpse
into our future.

326
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:19,426
You know, for once
we weren't sneaking around.

327
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,664
It was just nice and normal.

328
00:19:23,531 --> 00:19:27,669
It did, huh?
I felt completely at ease.

329
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:31,238
The--

330
00:19:32,674 --> 00:19:34,341
Whereabouts is your sister?

331
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:36,376
She lives in Paris.

332
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:38,478
I actually haven't seen her
in over a year.

333
00:19:38,613 --> 00:19:41,415
We had a bit of a falling out.

334
00:19:42,016 --> 00:19:43,151
Over what?

335
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:45,753
It's a long story,

336
00:19:46,954 --> 00:19:50,158
but we'll reconnect again.

337
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,926
We always do.

338
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,394
And once your divorce is final,
I'll introduce you to my mom

339
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:56,097
and the rest of my family.

340
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:58,331
I'm sure you'll meet
my sister too.

341
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:00,868
These last couple
of days have been

342
00:20:01,002 --> 00:20:02,070
so amazing with you.

343
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:03,370
I'll call you later, okay?

344
00:20:03,504 --> 00:20:04,739
You promise?

345
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:06,007
I promise.

346
00:20:06,574 --> 00:20:07,909
Fiona, don't worry, okay?

347
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:10,111
I'm gonna follow through
with what I said.

348
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:12,547
I made my choice
and I choose you.

349
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:17,985
Hello. Baby, I'm home.

350
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:20,955
Oh, no.

351
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:24,257
The plants are dying.

352
00:20:26,928 --> 00:20:28,663
Baby, are you here?

353
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:31,799
Hey, Celine.

354
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:33,835
-Hey.
-Hi.

355
00:20:33,968 --> 00:20:35,703
My plants are dying.
Why didn't you water them?

356
00:20:35,837 --> 00:20:39,607
Oh, uh, I forgot. I'm sorry.
Um, how was your trip?

357
00:20:40,174 --> 00:20:42,242
It was okay. You miss me?

358
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,644
Of course, I did.

359
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,414
But you barely texted me.

360
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:48,549
I know. I'm sorry.

361
00:20:48,683 --> 00:20:50,250
I was really busy at work

362
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:51,886
and um, I know how focused
you have to be

363
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:53,855
on your work trip,
so I didn't wanna bother you.

364
00:20:53,988 --> 00:20:55,056
Well, it's tough.

365
00:20:55,823 --> 00:20:58,826
If only I could get
the VP of marketing position,

366
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,561
things would've gone
more smoothly

367
00:21:00,695 --> 00:21:02,563
and I wouldn't need
to troubleshoot as much.

368
00:21:02,697 --> 00:21:04,165
Well, you're gonna get it.

369
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:05,533
I have a good feeling
about that.

370
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,802
Um, oh.

371
00:21:09,137 --> 00:21:12,006
Oh, this is work.
I-- I have to get this, okay?

372
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:16,844
Hello? Hey.

373
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:37,932
What's wrong?

374
00:21:38,065 --> 00:21:40,067
I'm exhausted, babe.

375
00:21:40,201 --> 00:21:43,037
How are we gonna have a baby
if we aren't even doing it?

376
00:21:43,171 --> 00:21:44,539
We're gonna try tomorrow.

377
00:21:44,672 --> 00:21:48,408
It's not how it works.
I'm ovulating now.

378
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:50,978
I thought you
said you wanted to try.

379
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,481
Hm, tomorrow. I promise, okay?

380
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:10,064
I cannot wait.

381
00:22:10,198 --> 00:22:12,365
I'm telling you just a little
bit longer and he is mine.

382
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:14,535
He's yours? Like completely.

383
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:16,204
Yeah.

384
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:24,946
No, no, no, no.
I don't sound that dumb.

385
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:26,413
-Yeah, you do. Sometimes.
-You are an asshole.

386
00:22:27,949 --> 00:22:29,550
Come on.
Aren't you happy for me?

387
00:22:29,684 --> 00:22:31,219
At least now,
you won't have to hear me bitch

388
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:32,553
and complain about his wife.

389
00:22:32,687 --> 00:22:34,421
Oh, thank God.

390
00:22:34,555 --> 00:22:36,389
But you are making it
sound so easy.

391
00:22:36,524 --> 00:22:38,793
You do realize
divorces take like for evs.

392
00:22:38,926 --> 00:22:40,493
Yeah, but at least
he'll be with me

393
00:22:40,628 --> 00:22:42,163
while he's going through it.

394
00:22:42,296 --> 00:22:44,765
When he finally does it,
then I'll celebrate with you.

395
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:46,868
Wait, wait, wait. You--

396
00:22:47,001 --> 00:22:48,468
you don't think
he's gonna do it?

397
00:22:48,603 --> 00:22:51,471
Girl, I see this happen
all the time.

398
00:22:51,606 --> 00:22:52,840
The husband tells the lover,

399
00:22:52,974 --> 00:22:54,609
"I'm gonna
leave my wife for you."

400
00:22:54,742 --> 00:22:56,010
And then, when it actually
comes to doing it,

401
00:22:56,143 --> 00:22:58,246
things get complicated,
reality hits

402
00:22:58,378 --> 00:22:59,747
and most of the time,

403
00:22:59,881 --> 00:23:01,381
<i>señor</i> prince
charming backs out.

404
00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:02,482
I'm just saying
if he finally does it,

405
00:23:02,617 --> 00:23:03,885
we can celebrate.

406
00:23:04,018 --> 00:23:05,686
Hell, I'll even
get you a fucking cake

407
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,356
and I'll have it decorated
"The boy is mine," Huh?

408
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:10,124
You are such a jerk.

409
00:23:10,258 --> 00:23:11,926
Come on, Zora. We gotta
get back to the studio.

410
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:13,928
-We got a lot of work to do.
-Yeah, work.

411
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:16,964
You just wanna get back to
your fuck boy waiting on ice.

412
00:23:17,698 --> 00:23:19,033
Good to see you, Celine.

413
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:20,735
Is your husband with you?

414
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:24,404
No. He's at work. Why?
Is everything okay?

415
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:25,940
Your health is A-okay,

416
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:28,109
but I'd hate for you
to hear this alone.

417
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:30,878
Is there a chance
you can call your husband in?

418
00:23:31,512 --> 00:23:32,813
He's at work.

419
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:36,050
What is it? Just tell me.

420
00:23:37,852 --> 00:23:41,421
Your endometriosis has scarred
your fallopian tubes

421
00:23:41,555 --> 00:23:46,294
and your chances
of conceiving are less than 1%.

422
00:23:47,862 --> 00:23:51,032
Um, 1%?

423
00:23:51,165 --> 00:23:57,338
Uh... W-- what about IVF
or other alternatives?

424
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,408
I have your charts here.
I can show you.

425
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:04,745
1%. 1%.

426
00:24:06,247 --> 00:24:08,883
I am terribly sorry.
Mrs. Castillo!

427
00:24:33,741 --> 00:24:35,109
It's gonna
be good for business.

428
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:37,144
Hey, let me
call you back, okay?

429
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:40,581
Honey, what's wrong?

430
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:45,886
It's just, uh, I just got back

431
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,223
from the appointment
with the doctor

432
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:50,624
and they said

433
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:56,330
that I'm unable
to have children.

434
00:24:58,265 --> 00:25:02,937
All I ever wanted
is to have your baby, our baby,

435
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:07,008
and now that I can't have it,
I want it even more.

436
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:12,046
And it's not even possible.
It's never been possible.

437
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,015
Everything's gonna be okay.

438
00:25:14,148 --> 00:25:17,018
Everything is
not gonna be okay.

439
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:22,690
It is never gonna be okay.
You can't fix it.

440
00:25:27,028 --> 00:25:28,996
Let me get you
some tissue, okay?

441
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:47,248
Oh, my God.

442
00:25:53,687 --> 00:25:55,556
Oh, my God.

443
00:26:09,336 --> 00:26:11,572
Honey, I think
we're out of tissue, okay?

444
00:26:11,705 --> 00:26:12,973
I can't find any.

445
00:26:14,775 --> 00:26:16,577
Who's Fiona?

446
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,648
Huh?

447
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:23,951
Who's Fiona? Answer me.

448
00:26:24,085 --> 00:26:25,619
She's just a friend, okay?

449
00:26:25,753 --> 00:26:27,321
-Let me get my phone back.
-Just a friend?

450
00:26:28,189 --> 00:26:29,256
Yes.

451
00:26:30,724 --> 00:26:32,893
Give me.
Celine, give me back my phone.

452
00:26:33,027 --> 00:26:34,563
You changed your password.

453
00:26:34,695 --> 00:26:36,363
Now, I know that
you're hiding something.

454
00:26:37,631 --> 00:26:39,100
-Celine.
-Give me your password

455
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:40,901
or I will break your phone
into pieces I swear.

456
00:26:41,035 --> 00:26:42,837
No need to get crazy.

457
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:46,373
Fine. There's only
a couple things it could be.

458
00:26:54,415 --> 00:26:56,984
Caleb, have you
been having an affair?

459
00:26:58,219 --> 00:27:01,556
This bitch just said
she's pregnant.

460
00:27:01,689 --> 00:27:03,124
-What?
-Is it your baby?

461
00:27:03,257 --> 00:27:05,726
Are you having a baby
with someone else?

462
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,028
Look, I-- I've been
meaning to tell you.

463
00:27:08,162 --> 00:27:10,030
I've been meaning
to talk to you.

464
00:27:10,164 --> 00:27:11,632
Have or haven't you
been having an affair?

465
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:12,700
I don't know
anything about a ba--

466
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:14,101
Yes, I had an affair.

467
00:27:14,235 --> 00:27:16,137
But I don't know
anything about a baby!

468
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:19,373
How could you! How could you!
How could you! How could you!

469
00:27:23,612 --> 00:27:26,780
No, no.

470
00:27:35,557 --> 00:27:38,192
She's having my baby.

471
00:27:40,761 --> 00:27:42,496
My baby.

472
00:27:42,631 --> 00:27:45,132
No.

473
00:27:45,266 --> 00:27:46,734
No.

474
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:52,706
I want you to start
at the beginning

475
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,176
and I want complete honesty.

476
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:58,179
I first wanna
start off by saying that

477
00:27:59,013 --> 00:28:01,348
it wasn't my intention
to hurt you

478
00:28:01,482 --> 00:28:03,317
or ruin our marriage.

479
00:28:04,385 --> 00:28:07,922
Celine, you are
an incredible woman.

480
00:28:08,623 --> 00:28:10,525
Where did you first meet?

481
00:28:11,158 --> 00:28:13,961
I'm happy in our marriage

482
00:28:14,094 --> 00:28:17,364
and I wasn't out there
searching for another woman

483
00:28:17,498 --> 00:28:18,966
or to have an affair.

484
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:23,704
At a grocery store
over a year ago.

485
00:28:24,705 --> 00:28:27,208
When was the first time
you had sex?

486
00:28:28,943 --> 00:28:30,311
It's-- it's not important.

487
00:28:30,444 --> 00:28:32,346
Answer the question!

488
00:28:33,414 --> 00:28:35,049
Within a week.

489
00:28:37,751 --> 00:28:39,253
Is that her?

490
00:28:41,822 --> 00:28:44,091
Caleb, is that her?

491
00:28:50,565 --> 00:28:56,036
My mom always said
I could never choose a man.

492
00:28:56,904 --> 00:28:59,206
I guess she was right.

493
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,941
Celine.

494
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:03,712
You are a fucking coward.

495
00:29:03,844 --> 00:29:05,312
I hate myself
for doing this to you.

496
00:29:05,446 --> 00:29:08,315
Not as much as
I hate you right now.

497
00:29:10,552 --> 00:29:13,254
And I can promise you
that you will regret this.

498
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:18,058
I'm so sorry.

499
00:29:32,507 --> 00:29:33,841
Baby.

500
00:29:33,974 --> 00:29:35,442
I've been waiting
for you to text me back.

501
00:29:35,577 --> 00:29:36,810
What's going on?

502
00:29:37,411 --> 00:29:39,980
I-I just wanna ask,
and I don't wanna sound cruel,

503
00:29:40,114 --> 00:29:42,283
but is it my baby?

504
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:45,286
It is yours.

505
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:47,187
100%.

506
00:29:49,857 --> 00:29:50,991
Aren't you happy?

507
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,527
I am.
I will be.

508
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:56,797
I just gotta tell you
everything that happened today.

509
00:29:57,364 --> 00:29:59,466
-Okay. Let's go inside.
-Okay.

510
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,385
I-I guess this is it.

511
00:30:19,386 --> 00:30:21,523
You never even gave us a chance.

512
00:30:22,724 --> 00:30:26,060
A chance to work out
whatever it was that went wrong.

513
00:30:27,394 --> 00:30:29,963
And now you're not
even fighting to stay.

514
00:30:30,565 --> 00:30:31,899
You don't deserve this.

515
00:30:32,032 --> 00:30:33,300
You don't deserve
to be treated like this.

516
00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:37,871
Just know if it doesn't
work out, you can't come back.

517
00:30:40,107 --> 00:30:41,509
My lawyer will be in touch.

518
00:30:42,209 --> 00:30:44,178
You know,
this isn't easy for me either.

519
00:30:44,311 --> 00:30:45,879
Okay?
I still love you.

520
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:48,215
You don't get
to say that to me anymore.

521
00:30:54,054 --> 00:30:56,190
-Caleb.
-Yeah?

522
00:30:57,858 --> 00:30:59,293
Is it your baby?

523
00:31:03,832 --> 00:31:05,265
Yeah.

524
00:31:20,782 --> 00:31:22,349
Son of a bitch!

525
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:39,099
She's all yours.

526
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:41,068
Hey, wait,
you have to sign this.

527
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:43,571
Uh, you have to sign this.

528
00:31:44,606 --> 00:31:45,673
Hey!

529
00:31:48,777 --> 00:31:50,210
What the hell?

530
00:34:48,155 --> 00:34:50,558
I am definitely outta my league
with all this stuff.

531
00:34:50,692 --> 00:34:54,461
It's okay.
I know what we need.

532
00:34:55,897 --> 00:34:57,065
Good.

533
00:34:57,197 --> 00:34:58,633
This is the one.

534
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,669
Alright.
Well, let's do it.

535
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,739
And we'll come back
one more time

536
00:35:04,872 --> 00:35:06,440
or many times
'cause I'm not sure

537
00:35:06,574 --> 00:35:07,909
what we're gonna
get from the shower yet, so.

538
00:35:08,042 --> 00:35:09,343
Okay.

539
00:35:09,476 --> 00:35:11,378
I can't
wait to have your baby.

540
00:35:12,412 --> 00:35:14,147
And to get my body back.

541
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:16,283
Yes, please.
I need your body back.

542
00:35:17,986 --> 00:35:20,788
You made me
be happiest woman on earth.

543
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,525
Excuse me, ma'am.

544
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:26,828
Can I get by you
to grab that item there?

545
00:35:27,294 --> 00:35:28,563
- Sorry.
- Good choice.

546
00:35:28,696 --> 00:35:30,297
- Thank you.
- We will, uh,

547
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,667
email you the receipt
and the tracking number,

548
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,702
and, uh, you should get it
by next Friday.

549
00:35:34,836 --> 00:35:37,038
Perfect. And you
have our card on file?

550
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,338
Yes, I do.

551
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:39,807
-Awesome.
-Thank you.

552
00:35:39,941 --> 00:35:41,408
It's pretty easy and fast.

553
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:43,011
Yeah.
They don't want you to have

554
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:44,846
any time
to think about it.

555
00:35:45,345 --> 00:35:47,214
Just don't look
at how much it costs.

556
00:35:57,391 --> 00:35:58,926
Hey, lady!
What's wrong with you?

557
00:36:29,222 --> 00:36:30,892
-Hi.
-Hi, there.

558
00:36:32,727 --> 00:36:34,729
Congratulations.

559
00:36:34,862 --> 00:36:35,997
Excuse me?

560
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,565
Newly pregnant?

561
00:36:40,467 --> 00:36:44,005
Uh, yes, just a few weeks along.

562
00:36:44,138 --> 00:36:47,175
It never hurts
to read up on everything.

563
00:36:47,307 --> 00:36:48,676
Good for you.

564
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,477
I had four children
of my own, you know.

565
00:36:50,611 --> 00:36:52,279
I thought, oh no.

566
00:36:52,412 --> 00:36:55,049
Maybe I was mistaken and you
were just buying for a friend.

567
00:36:55,183 --> 00:36:57,952
You see, I can always tell.

568
00:36:58,086 --> 00:36:59,520
You can always tell?

569
00:36:59,654 --> 00:37:02,690
I can always tell
who the mothers-to-be are

570
00:37:02,824 --> 00:37:05,026
and who's just
shopping for a shower.

571
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,930
You see,
I wasn't wrong.

572
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:10,965
Thank you so much.

573
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:13,768
It means a lot. I've
always wanted to be a mother.

574
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:15,870
Boy or a girl
wouldn't matter to me.

575
00:37:16,003 --> 00:37:19,339
I'm sure your husband
is very excited.

576
00:37:19,473 --> 00:37:23,044
He is. He's gonna be
a great father.

577
00:37:23,811 --> 00:37:27,081
Bye now. Take care.
Come back soon.

578
00:37:27,215 --> 00:37:28,649
I will.

579
00:37:34,555 --> 00:37:36,256
- Just pack it up?
- Yeah.

580
00:37:36,657 --> 00:37:38,793
Hey, how's Celine?

581
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:40,728
Has she been
by your place lately?

582
00:37:41,195 --> 00:37:42,395
We see her from time to time.

583
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:43,998
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

584
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,569
Yo, I thought
you two were happy.

585
00:37:49,704 --> 00:37:51,806
I was until I met Fiona.

586
00:37:53,508 --> 00:37:55,510
Dude, I'm having a baby.

587
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,945
Yeah, I-I can't
believe it either.

588
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:00,882
All right, let's get outta here.

589
00:38:09,624 --> 00:38:12,593
Hey, is that your new car?

590
00:38:13,861 --> 00:38:16,130
I passed by that Italian place
that you love so much

591
00:38:16,264 --> 00:38:18,633
and got you some of like
crunchy bread that you like.

592
00:38:19,834 --> 00:38:22,369
What is this?
Why are you here?

593
00:38:22,503 --> 00:38:24,605
Shouldn't you be off
enjoying your new life?

594
00:38:24,972 --> 00:38:27,975
Celine, everything
happened so fast. Alright?

595
00:38:28,109 --> 00:38:30,343
Truth is, I'm just
not used to not living here

596
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:32,647
with you
and being apart from you.

597
00:38:33,047 --> 00:38:34,447
And?

598
00:38:34,582 --> 00:38:36,284
And we were together
for such a long time.

599
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:38,318
I can't just forget about you.

600
00:38:39,053 --> 00:38:40,453
Save your useless words.

601
00:38:40,588 --> 00:38:43,390
They're empty
and they don't change anything.

602
00:38:43,524 --> 00:38:47,562
You wanted this divorce and now
you're trying to butter me up.

603
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,531
You have some damn nerve.

604
00:38:58,338 --> 00:39:00,373
-I am sorry.
-Go.

605
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:25,066
Caleb!

606
00:39:27,535 --> 00:39:28,936
Hey.

607
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,609
Come on, let's go outside.

608
00:39:37,778 --> 00:39:39,680
That bitch!

609
00:39:41,182 --> 00:39:42,415
Celine?

610
00:39:43,251 --> 00:39:46,087
Yes, Celine.
Who else would do this?

611
00:39:47,255 --> 00:39:49,924
Are you going to take care
of this or do I need to?

612
00:39:51,325 --> 00:39:52,760
I got it.

613
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:08,809
<i>What the hell is wrong with</i>
<i>you?</i>

614
00:40:09,543 --> 00:40:12,313
I beg your pardon?
Is everything okay?

615
00:40:12,445 --> 00:40:13,814
Our house has been vandalized.

616
00:40:13,948 --> 00:40:15,616
And by the looks of it,
it's pretty obvious

617
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,385
-that it was you.
-Trouble in paradise, Caleb?

618
00:40:17,518 --> 00:40:18,920
Cut the shit, Celine.

619
00:40:19,053 --> 00:40:21,355
Do you really think
the people don't know

620
00:40:21,488 --> 00:40:22,924
what you did to me?

621
00:40:23,624 --> 00:40:24,859
To us?

622
00:40:24,992 --> 00:40:26,227
Do you think people
look at you

623
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,828
and are honestly happy for you?

624
00:40:28,262 --> 00:40:30,197
You don't deserve
a happy life, Caleb.

625
00:40:30,331 --> 00:40:32,600
Am I gonna have to get
a restraining order against you?

626
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:34,769
'Cause that's not
a good look for your reputation.

627
00:40:34,902 --> 00:40:36,671
Do you really think
you can convince anyone

628
00:40:36,804 --> 00:40:39,173
that I had
anything to do with this?

629
00:40:40,408 --> 00:40:41,742
Prove it.

630
00:40:45,746 --> 00:40:47,181
What happened?
What did she say?

631
00:40:53,654 --> 00:40:55,488
I swear,
if I wasn't pregnant,

632
00:40:55,623 --> 00:40:58,192
I would handle that
myself.

633
00:40:58,926 --> 00:41:00,628
So are we gonna
have to get a restraining order?

634
00:41:00,761 --> 00:41:02,930
I mean, I don't wanna be
looking over my shoulder, Caleb.

635
00:41:03,064 --> 00:41:04,865
I don't know.
I don't know.

636
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:06,767
It might not be a good look
to get a restraining order

637
00:41:06,901 --> 00:41:08,602
while I'm trying
to finalize divorce.

638
00:41:08,736 --> 00:41:10,104
Not a good look?

639
00:41:10,237 --> 00:41:11,706
Look, it's gonna be
hard to convince anybody

640
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,074
that she's behind this.

641
00:41:13,207 --> 00:41:14,809
Listen,
if she does something else,

642
00:41:14,942 --> 00:41:16,476
then we'll get
the restraining order.

643
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:19,547
Until then
I'll just install some cameras.

644
00:41:21,015 --> 00:41:22,950
-Okay. Fine.
-Come on.

645
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,255
<i>Damn, girl. That's crazy.</i>

646
00:41:28,389 --> 00:41:29,757
<i>But if the tables were turned,</i>

647
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:31,491
<i>I'm sure you</i>
<i>would've lashed out too.</i>

648
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:33,461
You're not
taking her side, are you?

649
00:41:33,594 --> 00:41:35,062
<i>Of course not.</i>

650
00:41:35,196 --> 00:41:36,931
<i>But I'm just saying, girl,</i>
<i>you didn't think</i>

651
00:41:37,064 --> 00:41:38,733
<i>she would actually let</i>
<i>him go quietly, did you?</i>

652
00:41:39,834 --> 00:41:41,769
I mean, I kinda did.

653
00:41:43,537 --> 00:41:45,039
I just, I didn't
know that people

654
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:47,541
in the suburbs had it
in them to get this crazy.

655
00:41:47,675 --> 00:41:50,678
<i>Never underestimate</i>
<i>a white bitch with money.</i>

656
00:41:54,048 --> 00:41:55,516
Yeah. Well,
after I have this baby,

657
00:41:55,649 --> 00:41:57,618
she better not
underestimate me either.

658
00:42:07,461 --> 00:42:08,596
Shit!

659
00:42:08,729 --> 00:42:10,064
You miss me, baby?

660
00:42:10,197 --> 00:42:11,532
Come fuck me.

661
00:42:11,665 --> 00:42:13,067
Oh my God, you're wasted.

662
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,435
- Where's your clothes?
- Come on, Caleb.

663
00:42:14,568 --> 00:42:15,803
Stop being such a.

664
00:42:15,936 --> 00:42:17,571
Cover up!

665
00:42:18,572 --> 00:42:19,874
Playing hard to get, are you?

666
00:42:20,007 --> 00:42:21,542
You're drunk.
I'm taking you home.

667
00:42:21,675 --> 00:42:23,044
No!

668
00:42:23,177 --> 00:42:24,812
Oh my God.
Jesus Christ!

669
00:42:24,945 --> 00:42:26,981
How could
you do this to me, Caleb?

670
00:42:32,186 --> 00:42:34,955
Slap on
the hand for the vandalism.

671
00:42:35,089 --> 00:42:36,223
It's done.

672
00:42:36,357 --> 00:42:37,526
I'll forget about it.

673
00:42:38,092 --> 00:42:41,729
But no more surprises, please.

674
00:42:43,297 --> 00:42:44,732
Or it's gonna get ugly.

675
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:48,002
I mean that.

676
00:42:48,936 --> 00:42:52,173
It's all nice.
And the spread looks so good.

677
00:42:53,374 --> 00:42:54,809
Oh.

678
00:42:57,778 --> 00:42:58,913
<i>Mi amor.</i>

679
00:42:59,046 --> 00:43:00,481
Hi, baby.

680
00:43:00,848 --> 00:43:02,116
-What's up, bro?
-Good to see you.

681
00:43:02,249 --> 00:43:04,151
-Good to see you too.
-Quick pic.

682
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:05,486
-Yes.
-Oh, yeah.

683
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:06,555
Yes.

684
00:43:06,687 --> 00:43:07,721
I'll sign it later on.

685
00:43:07,855 --> 00:43:09,190
Oh good.
Me too.

686
00:43:13,727 --> 00:43:14,895
This is looking really nice.

687
00:43:15,029 --> 00:43:16,764
-It looks good, right?
-Yeah.

688
00:43:16,897 --> 00:43:20,167
Alright, baby. You're
used to getting all these balls.

689
00:43:22,803 --> 00:43:25,106
You got this.
There you go.

690
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:27,007
So far you got two balls.
Good job.

691
00:43:27,374 --> 00:43:29,544
You're lying.
I have to have more than that.

692
00:43:29,677 --> 00:43:31,045
Girl, come on. No.

693
00:43:31,178 --> 00:43:32,780
- Come on, sweetie.
- Right there.

694
00:43:32,913 --> 00:43:34,115
- There you go.
- Right there. Okay.

695
00:43:34,815 --> 00:43:36,585
Are you taking them away?

696
00:43:36,717 --> 00:43:37,952
Oh, no. Not at all.

697
00:43:38,085 --> 00:43:39,420
You're gonna
open your eyes and see.

698
00:43:39,554 --> 00:43:41,122
Oh, okay.
Okay, okay.

699
00:43:41,255 --> 00:43:43,124
There you go.
There you go.

700
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:48,162
You guys are messing with me!

701
00:44:10,017 --> 00:44:13,220
Oh my God.
It's hot in there.

702
00:44:13,354 --> 00:44:14,488
It sure is.

703
00:44:14,623 --> 00:44:16,290
This probably doesn't help.

704
00:44:16,423 --> 00:44:18,627
But it looks like
everyone's having so much fun.

705
00:44:18,759 --> 00:44:20,027
Everyone
is having a great time.

706
00:44:20,161 --> 00:44:21,462
- It's so good.
- And you won

707
00:44:21,596 --> 00:44:22,830
all the games.
I love it.

708
00:44:22,963 --> 00:44:24,231
I think
everyone let me win.

709
00:44:24,365 --> 00:44:25,733
Yeah, of course.

710
00:44:28,802 --> 00:44:30,804
-Oh, I feel it.
-You feel that?

711
00:44:30,938 --> 00:44:32,373
Oh, my God.

712
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:35,409
Oh my God. Oh!

713
00:44:35,544 --> 00:44:36,744
Oh!

714
00:44:36,877 --> 00:44:38,145
Oh my God.
It like butterflies.

715
00:44:38,279 --> 00:44:39,346
Yeah.

716
00:44:43,884 --> 00:44:45,753
- I love you.
- I love you too.

717
00:44:47,288 --> 00:44:48,822
Alright,
I think I need to sit down.

718
00:44:48,956 --> 00:44:50,391
I got you.

719
00:44:51,091 --> 00:44:52,627
-Alright. Thank you.
-Alright. You good?

720
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,028
Yes.

721
00:45:18,553 --> 00:45:21,188
Oh, my goodness.

722
00:45:22,756 --> 00:45:25,426
Oh, so cute.

723
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,095
-Gracias, <i>tia.</i>
<i>-De nada.</i>

724
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:41,302
Lena, where's Fiona?

725
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:42,737
In-- in the ambulance.
Go. Go.

726
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:44,305
Fiona! Fiona!

727
00:46:44,905 --> 00:46:48,442
Hey. Oh my God.
Are you okay? You okay?

728
00:46:48,909 --> 00:46:50,044
I'm okay.
I got out--

729
00:46:50,177 --> 00:46:51,513
-Is the baby okay?
-Yes.

730
00:46:51,646 --> 00:46:53,247
The baby's okay.
I'm okay.

731
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,316
I got out as fast as I could
and I just held my breath.

732
00:46:55,784 --> 00:46:56,917
Oh, my God.

733
00:46:57,051 --> 00:46:58,586
Oh my God, baby.
Where's my mom?

734
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,387
She's fine, she's fine.
She's back there. She's okay.

735
00:47:00,522 --> 00:47:02,456
She's fine. Okay?
Looks like nobody got hurt.

736
00:47:03,223 --> 00:47:04,925
- Caleb. Fiona.
- Yeah.

737
00:47:05,059 --> 00:47:06,460
I'm Martin.
I own this building.

738
00:47:06,594 --> 00:47:08,896
Look, I'm sorry
about what happened today,

739
00:47:09,029 --> 00:47:11,098
but I'm so glad
that everybody got out safely.

740
00:47:11,231 --> 00:47:13,367
- What the hell happened?
- I'm not a 100% sure

741
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,337
but it could have to do
with an electrical shortage.

742
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:17,806
Here's my card.

743
00:47:17,938 --> 00:47:19,406
We'll be in touch
with further information

744
00:47:19,541 --> 00:47:22,009
and insurance
for any losses or damage.

745
00:47:22,811 --> 00:47:24,244
I'm terribly sorry.

746
00:47:25,346 --> 00:47:26,581
Okay.

747
00:47:35,155 --> 00:47:38,258
Hey, don't
get yourself worked up.

748
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,328
Fiona,
I could have lost you

749
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:43,230
and I don't take that lightly.

750
00:47:43,364 --> 00:47:45,165
Your whole family was inside.

751
00:47:46,867 --> 00:47:48,302
I know. But I'm...

752
00:47:49,303 --> 00:47:50,739
trying not
to think about it

753
00:47:50,871 --> 00:47:53,140
so I don't
put stress on the baby.

754
00:47:57,311 --> 00:47:59,380
You're right. I'm sorry.

755
00:48:00,548 --> 00:48:01,882
I have
the owner's card, um,

756
00:48:02,015 --> 00:48:03,450
I'm gonna be in touch with him.

757
00:48:04,753 --> 00:48:06,019
Okay?

758
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:52,065
My wrist
is starting to cramp.

759
00:48:52,801 --> 00:48:54,134
I know.

760
00:48:54,268 --> 00:48:56,805
Oh, we are going
to make a killing

761
00:48:56,937 --> 00:48:58,272
on this collection, Miguel.

762
00:48:58,405 --> 00:48:59,841
-I can feel it.
-We better.

763
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:06,480
Ooh, break me
off a piece of that.

764
00:49:07,247 --> 00:49:09,450
Ooh. Oh, Those eyebrows
are on point.

765
00:49:09,584 --> 00:49:11,553
I know.

766
00:49:12,085 --> 00:49:13,521
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

767
00:49:41,381 --> 00:49:44,953
I know I'm a little late,
but I did promise.

768
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,121
- No!
- The boy is mine.

769
00:49:48,255 --> 00:49:49,791
He is.

770
00:49:49,924 --> 00:49:51,058
-You got him, girl.
-Mm.

771
00:49:51,191 --> 00:49:52,594
You got my favorite?

772
00:49:52,727 --> 00:49:54,829
-Yeah.
-Mm. Mm.

773
00:49:58,265 --> 00:50:01,335
He freaking better be
at this point, right?

774
00:50:06,908 --> 00:50:09,611
Alan.
Look, there's Celine.

775
00:50:09,744 --> 00:50:11,111
What?

776
00:50:14,949 --> 00:50:16,951
What in the actual fuck?

777
00:50:17,084 --> 00:50:18,720
Hide. I don't
want her to see us.

778
00:50:22,055 --> 00:50:23,758
We're not gonna
mention this to anyone.

779
00:50:23,892 --> 00:50:25,392
We're just-- we're just gonna
pretend like we never saw this.

780
00:50:25,527 --> 00:50:27,227
Okay? She would be
mortified if she saw us.

781
00:50:27,361 --> 00:50:29,664
Why?

782
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:54,087
This
is a friend of Jacques'.

783
00:50:55,455 --> 00:51:00,260
My confirmation code
is 439B as in boy,

784
00:51:01,328 --> 00:51:03,765
T as in Tom, 99.

785
00:51:05,633 --> 00:51:10,137
I need something big done
and I'm willing to pay

786
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:12,472
any amount of money
to get it done.

787
00:51:14,742 --> 00:51:18,813
Sounds fantastic.
I'll be in touch.

788
00:51:37,632 --> 00:51:38,766
Please!

789
00:51:39,567 --> 00:51:41,769
Please take care of my baby.

790
00:51:41,903 --> 00:51:44,572
No.

791
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:47,709
Please. No!

792
00:51:47,842 --> 00:51:49,077
-Please!
-Baby.

793
00:51:49,443 --> 00:51:50,678
Wake up. Wake up.

794
00:51:50,812 --> 00:51:52,279
You're just
having a bad dream.

795
00:51:54,348 --> 00:51:56,316
Okay?
Just a bad dream.

796
00:52:02,456 --> 00:52:04,157
If anything happens to me,

797
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:06,259
just know that I love you.

798
00:52:07,028 --> 00:52:08,395
Please take care of our baby.

799
00:52:08,529 --> 00:52:09,964
Hey, hey, hey.
Relax.

800
00:52:10,531 --> 00:52:11,966
Don't be saying that.
Okay?

801
00:52:12,567 --> 00:52:14,234
You're fine.
It's just a dream.

802
00:52:14,368 --> 00:52:15,637
I'm not gonna let
anything bad happen to you.

803
00:52:22,877 --> 00:52:24,746
Oh, that's beautiful.

804
00:52:24,879 --> 00:52:26,313
Beautiful.

805
00:52:27,247 --> 00:52:28,583
Caleb, you can
go ahead and join her.

806
00:52:28,716 --> 00:52:30,350
-Hey, baby.
-All right.

807
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:33,655
Oh, I love it.

808
00:52:34,321 --> 00:52:37,457
Perfect.
You guys are too cute.

809
00:53:03,918 --> 00:53:05,053
You did it.

810
00:53:17,799 --> 00:53:19,433
I am looking for Celine.

811
00:53:19,734 --> 00:53:20,668
I'm Celine.

812
00:53:20,802 --> 00:53:22,302
I'm here
to pick up payment

813
00:53:22,436 --> 00:53:24,337
for today's
business transaction.

814
00:53:24,906 --> 00:53:26,741
So when you say today,
does that mean

815
00:53:26,874 --> 00:53:28,308
that they're
at the hospital now?

816
00:53:28,442 --> 00:53:29,677
Correct.

817
00:53:30,011 --> 00:53:31,846
So can you tell me
who's on the job?

818
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,347
That, I cannot.

819
00:53:40,555 --> 00:53:41,923
What are you
offering an exchange

820
00:53:42,056 --> 00:53:43,691
for this information?

821
00:53:44,391 --> 00:53:45,760
What do you want?

822
00:54:23,798 --> 00:54:24,966
Dr. Smith?

823
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:26,366
Yes.

824
00:54:27,168 --> 00:54:28,636
Are you new here?

825
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:30,805
I'm Celine.

826
00:54:30,938 --> 00:54:33,273
I hired
you for today's transaction.

827
00:54:34,307 --> 00:54:37,211
What on earth
are you doing here?

828
00:54:37,912 --> 00:54:41,783
It's company policy
that we don't meet.

829
00:54:42,315 --> 00:54:43,951
If I were to speak of this,

830
00:54:44,451 --> 00:54:47,555
our new messenger boy
would be killed.

831
00:54:47,688 --> 00:54:50,725
I'm just here to make sure
everything runs smoothly.

832
00:54:50,858 --> 00:54:54,729
This isn't my first rodeo, dear.

833
00:54:56,864 --> 00:55:00,868
Do you know
what bothers me about society?

834
00:55:02,136 --> 00:55:07,307
No one ever pairs a pretty face

835
00:55:09,677 --> 00:55:11,779
with unspeakable crime.

836
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:15,750
Pretty people
don't have perfect lives.

837
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,421
Run along now, darling.

838
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:24,391
I'll take it from here.

839
00:55:42,409 --> 00:55:44,579
Look at the little cheeks.

840
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:51,018
<i>Gracias,</i> Lena.

841
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:04,665
Hi.

842
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:09,003
Now that I see him, he looks
like a Brody.

843
00:56:09,136 --> 00:56:10,671
What do you think?

844
00:56:10,805 --> 00:56:13,708
Brody Caleb Castillo.
It's got a nice ring to it.

845
00:56:13,841 --> 00:56:14,909
Mm-hmm.

846
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:18,246
Hi, baby Brody.

847
00:56:18,779 --> 00:56:20,715
I'm gonna take
him to the nursery.

848
00:56:21,282 --> 00:56:22,550
Okay. Alright.

849
00:56:22,683 --> 00:56:24,018
Not for long.

850
00:56:24,151 --> 00:56:25,586
Oh.

851
00:56:28,388 --> 00:56:29,657
Thank you.

852
00:56:37,665 --> 00:56:40,400
-We did it, baby.
-We did. Huh?

853
00:56:48,408 --> 00:56:49,644
That was weird.

854
00:56:49,944 --> 00:56:51,879
-Yeah.
-It's a haunted hospital.

855
00:56:52,013 --> 00:56:54,081
Stop.

856
00:56:58,386 --> 00:56:59,820
It's okay, baby.
You can take it.

857
00:56:59,954 --> 00:57:01,522
Yeah?
All right. Well--

858
00:57:01,656 --> 00:57:03,090
I'm exhausted.
I'm just gonna take a nap.

859
00:57:03,224 --> 00:57:04,825
Okay. I'm gonna take
it outside. All right.

860
00:57:04,959 --> 00:57:06,560
If you need anything, text me.

861
00:57:07,995 --> 00:57:10,031
I can't wait for you to see him.

862
00:57:10,164 --> 00:57:11,899
He's adorable.

863
00:57:12,733 --> 00:57:15,069
Oh, my gosh.

864
00:57:24,512 --> 00:57:25,846
Could you step out for a moment?

865
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,349
I wanna go over
some protocols with Fiona.

866
00:57:28,481 --> 00:57:29,984
Sure thing, doctor.

867
00:57:46,434 --> 00:57:48,501
Wait, is that really necessary?

868
00:57:48,636 --> 00:57:49,904
I would rather keep them open.

869
00:57:50,037 --> 00:57:51,505
We want some privacy.

870
00:57:51,639 --> 00:57:53,541
I have some
questions to ask you.

871
00:57:54,141 --> 00:57:55,343
About what?

872
00:57:55,475 --> 00:57:57,912
You are not the doctor.

873
00:58:02,683 --> 00:58:05,152
I'm so sorry.

874
00:58:48,095 --> 00:58:49,163
Clear.

875
00:58:50,364 --> 00:58:52,099
-Hey, what's going on in there?
-Sir, I'm sorry.

876
00:58:52,233 --> 00:58:54,001
I can't have anyone over here.

877
00:58:54,135 --> 00:58:55,703
Why is he doing that?
That's my girlfriend in there.

878
00:58:55,836 --> 00:58:56,904
Why is he doing that to her?
What's going on?

879
00:58:57,038 --> 00:58:58,472
-Doctor knows what he's doing.

880
00:58:58,606 --> 00:58:59,840
Please, please.
I need you to calm down.

881
00:58:59,974 --> 00:59:01,542
Let's just wait
right over here for me.

882
00:59:01,675 --> 00:59:03,177
Okay? Come on.
The doctor will come out.

883
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:04,712
The doctor will come out
and everything is gonna be okay.

884
00:59:04,845 --> 00:59:06,480
Alright?
The doctor will come out.

885
00:59:06,614 --> 00:59:07,748
Everything's gonna be okay.
Just wait right here for me.

886
00:59:07,882 --> 00:59:09,617
Please. Wait right here.

887
00:59:10,618 --> 00:59:11,886
Oh God, Fiona.

888
00:59:16,023 --> 00:59:17,758
Do you know something?
Tell me--

889
00:59:17,892 --> 00:59:19,627
I don't know. I don't know
what's going on. Hey.

890
00:59:21,295 --> 00:59:23,230
-Are you Fiona's husband?
-Yeah.

891
00:59:25,066 --> 00:59:27,468
There were
unforeseen complications.

892
00:59:27,601 --> 00:59:29,303
She went into cardiac arrest.

893
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:31,572
We did everything
that we could to save her,

894
00:59:31,705 --> 00:59:33,407
but I'm sorry
to tell you this,

895
00:59:33,542 --> 00:59:34,909
she didn't make it.

896
00:59:35,042 --> 00:59:36,777
Wait, I was just in
there a few minutes ago.

897
00:59:36,911 --> 00:59:37,978
What do you mean she didn't
make it? She was fine.

898
00:59:38,112 --> 00:59:39,647
I'm truly sorry for you loss.

899
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:40,848
What do you mean
you're sorry for my loss?

900
00:59:40,981 --> 00:59:42,349
What happened-- what-- Fiona?

901
00:59:42,483 --> 00:59:44,318
Wait, what happened?
Tell me.

902
00:59:44,452 --> 00:59:45,686
What happened?

903
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:46,854
What do you mean
she didn't make it?

904
00:59:46,987 --> 00:59:48,422
What do you mean?

905
00:59:48,557 --> 00:59:50,658
What the fuck does that mean?
What you mean?

906
00:59:50,791 --> 00:59:51,959
What do you mean?

907
00:59:52,093 --> 00:59:54,495
Tell me, please.
What do you mean?

908
00:59:54,628 --> 00:59:56,330
What do you mean? God, no!

909
00:59:56,464 --> 00:59:58,065
What the fuck does that mean?

910
01:00:17,685 --> 01:00:19,153
Yeah.

911
01:00:20,488 --> 01:00:24,225
Caleb, I know you're sad.

912
01:00:25,527 --> 01:00:27,094
I sad too.

913
01:00:27,228 --> 01:00:29,930
Every day I miss my daughter,

914
01:00:30,865 --> 01:00:32,666
but she's in here now,

915
01:00:34,768 --> 01:00:38,405
and she left us
the best gift ever.

916
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:40,374
Baby Brody.

917
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:47,815
Um, I have to get to work.

918
01:00:47,948 --> 01:00:50,184
Um, now I'll be
back at six as usual.

919
01:00:52,987 --> 01:00:55,422
Caleb, I like cooking for you.

920
01:00:55,557 --> 01:00:57,224
You are working all day.

921
01:01:00,094 --> 01:01:02,730
Okay. Fair enough.
<i>Gracious,</i> Elena.

922
01:01:04,398 --> 01:01:05,799
Bye, Brody.

923
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,302
I love you.

924
01:01:08,435 --> 01:01:10,104
<i>Gracias.</i>

925
01:01:10,237 --> 01:01:11,672
Okay.

926
01:01:22,383 --> 01:01:23,884
Uh, Elena...

927
01:01:26,453 --> 01:01:28,389
...could you
put these inside for me?

928
01:01:36,797 --> 01:01:38,667
Mm-hmm. <i>Gracias.</i>

929
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:41,068
Okay.

930
01:01:54,181 --> 01:01:56,116
<i>I've been meaning</i>
<i>to reach out to you.</i>

931
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:58,653
<i>I just didn't know what to say.</i>

932
01:01:58,786 --> 01:02:03,390
<i>I wanted to give you some time</i>
<i>and let you grieve in peace.</i>

<i>It might sound strange,</i>

<i>I think of you</i>

935
01:02:10,565 --> 01:02:13,133
<i>and I think of you</i>
<i>raising a baby all on your own.</i>

<i>I can't imagine</i>

<i>Please call</i>

<i>Hopefully, someday</i>

01:02:27,649 --> 01:02:29,651
<i>Yours truly, Celine.</i>

942
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:44,865
Oh, Brody.

943
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,003
I am sorry your mom's not here.

944
01:03:27,007 --> 01:03:29,644
- Hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>

945
01:03:29,778 --> 01:03:35,215
<i>I was calling to see if you</i>
<i>wanted to do lunch sometime.</i>

946
01:03:36,518 --> 01:03:40,321
You-- you wanna go out
for lunch? What for?

947
01:03:40,454 --> 01:03:42,791
<i>I know you've been</i>
<i>through so much</i>

948
01:03:42,923 --> 01:03:45,926
<i>and I just wanna catch up.</i>

949

<i>How's Saturday?</i>

951
01:03:52,534 --> 01:03:54,602
Yeah, sure.

952
01:03:58,439 --> 01:04:00,742
Your order
will be coming right out.

953
01:04:00,874 --> 01:04:02,443
Great.

954
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:06,246
Here you go.
I'll go ahead and take these.

955
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:08,449
Oh, thanks.

956
01:04:14,656 --> 01:04:16,957
Caleb, hi.

957
01:04:17,458 --> 01:04:19,026
Hi.

958
01:04:21,629 --> 01:04:23,565
-It's good to see you.
-Good to see you.

959
01:04:23,698 --> 01:04:25,132
You-- you look great.

960
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,402
-Thanks for meeting me.
-Yeah.

961
01:04:29,604 --> 01:04:31,105
-Oh.
-Yeah.

962
01:04:37,812 --> 01:04:41,882
So, uh,
I-I think it's Brody?

963
01:04:42,015 --> 01:04:44,251
-I'd love to see his picture.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

964
01:04:44,719 --> 01:04:45,986
Um.

965
01:04:50,457 --> 01:04:51,526
Oh.

966
01:04:53,193 --> 01:04:54,863
He's adorable.

967
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:58,533
Wow.
He looks just like you.

968
01:04:59,333 --> 01:05:00,635
You have a mini-me.

969
01:05:00,769 --> 01:05:02,169
Yeah, that's-- that's my boy.

970
01:05:02,302 --> 01:05:03,904
He's growing up so quickly.

971
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,276
Well, if you ever need
a babysitter,

972
01:05:09,943 --> 01:05:11,211
you can call me.

973
01:05:12,112 --> 01:05:13,347
I mean that.

974
01:05:13,914 --> 01:05:15,349
Really?
You sure?

975
01:05:16,917 --> 01:05:18,586
I put the past behind me.

976
01:05:18,952 --> 01:05:20,622
I don't resent you anymore.

977
01:05:21,689 --> 01:05:24,491
So there's no reason
why we can't be friends.

978
01:05:25,459 --> 01:05:28,763
I guess as long
as it's not painful for you.

979
01:05:32,433 --> 01:05:34,301
-It's good to see you.
-You too.

980
01:05:34,736 --> 01:05:35,737
Here you guys go.

981
01:05:35,870 --> 01:05:36,937
Yes.

982
01:05:37,505 --> 01:05:39,306
-You guys enjoy.
-Thank you.

983
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,941
-Thank you.
-Of course.

984
01:05:41,475 --> 01:05:44,978
Um, it's your favorite,
pastrami.

985
01:05:45,112 --> 01:05:47,214
Yeah. Alright, let's do this.

986
01:05:50,718 --> 01:05:52,921
No, <i>problema.</i>
I-I'll call Lucia.

987
01:05:53,053 --> 01:05:54,321
<i>Gracias.</i>

988
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:01,361
<i>Hola</i> , Lucia.

989
01:06:02,362 --> 01:06:04,131
You can't come in
Wednesday either?

990
01:06:05,132 --> 01:06:07,167
Elena can't do it on Wednesday.

991
01:06:09,303 --> 01:06:12,206
No. No, <i>problema.</i>
I'll-- I'll figure it out.

992
01:06:12,339 --> 01:06:14,174
<i>Gracias.</i> Okay?

993
01:06:22,249 --> 01:06:24,519
Oh, Fiona, I wish you were here.

994
01:06:37,632 --> 01:06:38,867
Hi, Celine?

995
01:06:38,999 --> 01:06:41,268
Yeah. Ab-- absolutely.

996
01:06:41,401 --> 01:06:43,036
<i>Are you sure?</i>

997
01:06:43,605 --> 01:06:46,808
Uh, yeah.
I'd be happy to.

998
01:06:46,941 --> 01:06:48,643
<i>Well, come by on Sunday</i>

999
01:06:48,776 --> 01:06:51,245
<i>and if I see that you'll,</i>
<i>you know, do okay with him</i>

1000
01:06:51,378 --> 01:06:52,914
<i>then I'll let you</i>
<i>fill in on Wednesday.</i>

1001
01:06:53,046 --> 01:06:55,850
<i>-Wait, aren't you working?</i>
-Not on Wednesdays.

1002
01:06:55,984 --> 01:06:57,251
<i>Perfect.</i>

1003
01:06:58,620 --> 01:06:59,687
Great.

1004
01:07:11,398 --> 01:07:13,902
Clean bottles are up there.
The tops are somewhere.

1005
01:07:14,034 --> 01:07:15,435
I'm sorry the kitchen's
such a mess.

1006
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:17,605
-I haven't had time to clean.
-It's fine.

1007
01:07:17,739 --> 01:07:19,273
Yeah.

1008
01:07:29,851 --> 01:07:30,885
Look who woke up.

1009
01:07:36,323 --> 01:07:39,426
Oh! There he is.

1010
01:07:40,662 --> 01:07:41,763
May I?

1011
01:07:41,896 --> 01:07:43,531
Yeah.

1012
01:07:46,801 --> 01:07:48,703
Hey there, cutie,

1013
01:07:48,836 --> 01:07:53,508
We are gonna have so much fun,
aren't we? Aren't we?

1014
01:07:53,641 --> 01:07:57,011
All right. I gotta head out.
Um, you good?

1015
01:07:57,144 --> 01:07:58,746
I'm great.

1016
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:02,082
Well, call me
if you need anything, okay?

1017
01:08:02,784 --> 01:08:03,952
-Celine.
-Yeah.

1018
01:08:04,084 --> 01:08:05,485
Thank you.

1019
01:08:11,526 --> 01:08:12,594
Bye.

1020
01:10:02,335 --> 01:10:03,938
I miss you so much.

1021
01:10:23,057 --> 01:10:25,927
Oh, is today Thursday?

1022
01:10:26,561 --> 01:10:30,198
I totally forgot
it was your day to watch him.

1023
01:10:30,330 --> 01:10:33,467
Um, Caleb had
to leave to work early.

1024
01:10:34,736 --> 01:10:36,269
If you want, I can watch him.

1025
01:10:36,403 --> 01:10:39,207
Celine, this is my grandbaby.

1026
01:10:39,339 --> 01:10:41,209
I have not seen him all week.

1027
01:10:42,076 --> 01:10:46,547
I watch him today.
You, you go home. Mm?

1028
01:11:28,589 --> 01:11:30,290
Last night reminded me

1029
01:11:30,423 --> 01:11:33,561
of the year
we first started going out.

1030
01:11:33,694 --> 01:11:35,295
Mm-hmm.

1031
01:11:35,428 --> 01:11:36,964
That was a fun time.

1032
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,435
-Caleb.
-Mm-hmm.

1033
01:11:44,371 --> 01:11:45,873
Let's go home.

1034
01:11:52,613 --> 01:11:54,481
-Hi, Celine.
-Hi.

1035
01:12:01,522 --> 01:12:04,357
- Look, who's that?
- That's Mama.

1036
01:12:04,491 --> 01:12:06,359
That's Mama. Yeah.

1037
01:12:06,493 --> 01:12:09,997
Look, look. Who's that?

1038
01:12:10,131 --> 01:12:13,935
That's <i>Abuelita.</i>
Grandma.

1039
01:12:14,401 --> 01:12:17,470
Nana. Yeah.

1040
01:12:17,605 --> 01:12:19,707
You recognize her, huh?

1041
01:12:19,841 --> 01:12:23,744
Ah, she would've been
so happy to be here with you.

1042
01:12:26,147 --> 01:12:27,715
You look so much like her.

1043
01:12:29,382 --> 01:12:31,953
Look, it's mama again.

1044
01:12:33,754 --> 01:12:35,990
I can't tell you how
ecstatic I am for you, darling.

1045
01:12:36,123 --> 01:12:37,692
There was a minute there
where I thought

1046
01:12:37,825 --> 01:12:39,293
you'd spiral down
a rabbit hole so deep

1047
01:12:39,459 --> 01:12:40,261
that even I
couldn't dig you out.

1048
01:12:40,862 --> 01:12:42,429
Who's watching
the little bugger today?

1049
01:12:42,563 --> 01:12:43,865
His grandmother.

1050
01:12:44,599 --> 01:12:45,700
How's that dynamic?

1051
01:12:45,833 --> 01:12:46,601
What?

1052
01:12:46,734 --> 01:12:48,069
You and the grandmother?

1053
01:12:48,501 --> 01:12:50,470
I mean, she's his grandmother.

1054
01:12:50,605 --> 01:12:51,606
It is what it is.

1055
01:12:51,739 --> 01:12:53,007
If my mother were alive,

1056
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:54,809
she'd be the one
watching him today.

1057
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:58,112
Well, he is
an absolute heartbreaker.

1058
01:12:58,546 --> 01:13:00,081
Thanks.

1059
01:13:00,214 --> 01:13:02,583
I think he kinda looks like me.

1060
01:13:04,417 --> 01:13:05,686
Hmm.

1061
01:13:21,969 --> 01:13:23,537
Oh!

1062
01:13:26,841 --> 01:13:28,109
Oh my God. I know you.

1063
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:33,915
This-- this is you, right?
You're Caleb.

1064
01:13:35,516 --> 01:13:37,018
I'm Fiona's sister, Fabiola.

1065
01:13:37,151 --> 01:13:40,821
-It is so nice to meet you.
-Hi. Yes. Uh, right.

1066
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:44,525
I-I hope you don't mind.
Um, I'm--

1067
01:13:44,659 --> 01:13:47,194
my mom gave me her locket
after she passed.

1068
01:13:47,895 --> 01:13:48,963
No.

1069
01:13:50,197 --> 01:13:51,966
You know, I-I thought
we would've met sooner,

1070
01:13:52,099 --> 01:13:56,103
but you, um,
you weren't at the funeral.

1071
01:13:57,171 --> 01:14:00,440
Yeah. I-I'm sorry about that.
I just couldn't face going.

1072
01:14:01,175 --> 01:14:02,944
Yeah, no, I get it.

1073
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:07,114
I can't believe
I ran into you like this.

1074
01:14:07,248 --> 01:14:08,749
I just moved back into town

1075
01:14:08,883 --> 01:14:10,351
and it's been
a little crazy,

1076
01:14:10,483 --> 01:14:11,919
but I've been meaning
to get in touch

1077
01:14:12,053 --> 01:14:15,323
because I'm dying
to meet my nephew, Brody.

1078
01:14:15,455 --> 01:14:17,558
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
Of course, you can meet him.

1079
01:14:17,692 --> 01:14:19,427
Um, and see 'em. Yeah.

1080
01:14:19,961 --> 01:14:22,563
Oh, God. I-I've seen
pictures of you before and--

1081
01:14:22,697 --> 01:14:24,432
and I know that you
were identical twins,

1082
01:14:24,565 --> 01:14:26,600
but to see you in person,
it's just,

1083
01:14:26,734 --> 01:14:28,936
it's crazy. Wow.

1084
01:14:29,070 --> 01:14:32,106
Yeah. Heh-- it used
to drive our friends crazy.

1085
01:14:34,041 --> 01:14:37,211
You know, I was gonna call
and schedule something,

1086
01:14:37,345 --> 01:14:39,947
but this just feels like a sign.

1087
01:14:40,081 --> 01:14:43,084
Is there any way
I could come over now?

1088
01:14:43,617 --> 01:14:45,386
Like right now, right now?

1089
01:14:45,519 --> 01:14:47,922
Yeah.
If that's-- if that's okay.

1090
01:14:48,055 --> 01:14:50,024
Oh, it-- it--
it's best to schedule it.

1091
01:14:50,157 --> 01:14:51,993
Um, you know what,
maybe instead on Saturday

1092
01:14:52,126 --> 01:14:53,661
we're having a block party
for Labor Day.

1093
01:14:53,794 --> 01:14:55,096
Maybe you can meet him then.

1094
01:14:55,229 --> 01:14:57,932
Oh, it's just,

1095
01:14:58,065 --> 01:15:00,901
it's gonna be my first time
meeting with Brody

1096
01:15:01,035 --> 01:15:03,637
and I really want
that moment to be private.

1097
01:15:03,771 --> 01:15:06,574
Please.
I-I will be super quick.

1098
01:15:07,508 --> 01:15:09,110
Please.

1099
01:15:12,513 --> 01:15:14,682
Yeah. Um, sure.
Why not?

1100
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:16,784
Okay.
Are you ready now?

1101
01:15:16,917 --> 01:15:19,587
-Um, yeah. I'm ready.
-I'm just gonna leave those.

1102
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,088
Okay.

1103
01:15:24,992 --> 01:15:27,361
Hey, honey.

1104
01:15:27,495 --> 01:15:30,197
You won't believe
who I ran into at the store,

1105
01:15:30,331 --> 01:15:31,799
and she's here to see Brody.

1106
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:36,904
This is, uh, Fabiola.
Fiona's twin sister.

1107
01:15:38,172 --> 01:15:39,240
Twin sister.

1108
01:15:39,373 --> 01:15:40,875
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

1109
01:15:51,952 --> 01:15:53,654
Nice to meet you as well.

1110
01:15:53,788 --> 01:15:55,756
Caleb never mentioned
she had a twin.

1111
01:15:55,890 --> 01:15:57,591
Oh, well, I'm sorry to intrude.

1112
01:15:57,725 --> 01:16:00,561
I told Caleb I've been meaning
to come by and meet the baby,

1113
01:16:00,694 --> 01:16:03,364
and I just,
I-I couldn't wait anymore.

1114
01:16:03,497 --> 01:16:05,733
Yeah.
Well, he's over there.

1115
01:16:07,668 --> 01:16:09,170
-Can I?
-Yeah.

1116
01:16:10,104 --> 01:16:11,672
Oh, you're cute.

1117
01:16:13,874 --> 01:16:16,043
Hi, baby Brody.

1118
01:16:16,177 --> 01:16:17,711
Oh my gosh.

1119
01:16:19,447 --> 01:16:21,916
He's the last thing
I have left of my sister.

1120
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:25,853
I promise you,
I'm gonna be the best <i>tia</i> ever.

1121
01:16:25,986 --> 01:16:27,922
I'm gonna have these
all the time.

1122
01:16:28,055 --> 01:16:30,157
I'm gonna take all your photos.

1123
01:16:32,359 --> 01:16:33,727
He's so beautiful.

1124
01:16:35,496 --> 01:16:36,931
Is the baby asleep?

1125
01:16:37,532 --> 01:16:38,599
Yep.

1126
01:16:39,366 --> 01:16:42,169
I'm sorry for how I went down
today with, uh, Fabiola.

1127
01:16:43,037 --> 01:16:46,173
It's just we already have
the mother and the aunt,

1128
01:16:46,307 --> 01:16:47,708
and now the sister.

1129
01:16:47,842 --> 01:16:49,844
And you never told me
that she had a twin.

1130
01:16:49,977 --> 01:16:51,580
Well, look, she has a twin,
and now, you know.

1131
01:16:51,712 --> 01:16:54,849
And I understand why you're
upset, but this is family.

1132
01:16:54,982 --> 01:16:56,383
It isn't family.

1133
01:16:56,518 --> 01:16:58,152
Not your family. Not my family.

1134
01:16:58,285 --> 01:17:01,021
It's Brody's family,
and you can't change that.

1135
01:17:01,155 --> 01:17:03,023
I know, but do they have to be
so involved?

1136
01:17:03,157 --> 01:17:05,426
Brody is the only thing
they have left from Fiona.

1137
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:09,230
Oh God! Yes. I know. I know.
I hear about it all the--

1138
01:17:09,363 --> 01:17:10,865
Hey, hey.
Lower your voice, okay?

1139
01:17:10,998 --> 01:17:12,466
The neighbors
are gonna hear you.

1140
01:17:12,601 --> 01:17:15,269
Oh, I'm so sorry
if I'm interrupting!

1141
01:17:18,706 --> 01:17:21,510
Listen, I invited Fabiola
to the block party tomorrow.

1142
01:17:21,909 --> 01:17:23,811
What?
Why would you do that?

1143
01:17:23,944 --> 01:17:26,480
Doesn't she have anything
else to do?

1144
01:17:27,047 --> 01:17:29,216
I know that this doesn't
occur to you,

1145
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:31,218
but seeing her,

1146
01:17:31,352 --> 01:17:33,754
seeing her face
reminds me of losing you

1147
01:17:33,888 --> 01:17:35,022
and everything else
that went down.

1148
01:17:35,156 --> 01:17:37,324
I know.
And I'm sorry for that.

1149
01:17:37,458 --> 01:17:40,794
And... she looks just like her.

1150
01:17:40,928 --> 01:17:43,864
So, yeah, it's making
me feel a little uneasy.

1151
01:17:45,799 --> 01:17:48,302
You and I are back together.

1152
01:17:48,435 --> 01:17:51,305
Okay?
And you're Brody's mom now.

1153
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:54,108
You're right.

1154
01:17:55,409 --> 01:17:59,180
This is our second chance,
and I don't wanna ruin that.

1155
01:18:00,915 --> 01:18:02,249
And maybe just, maybe

1156
01:18:02,383 --> 01:18:04,418
we can get married
again in the future.

1157
01:18:07,021 --> 01:18:10,191
-You mean that?
-Yes, I mean it.

1158
01:18:11,725 --> 01:18:13,194
Caleb.

1159
01:18:17,298 --> 01:18:19,066
All right?

1160
01:18:19,466 --> 01:18:22,136
Now let's relax
and enjoy our drinks.

1161
01:18:27,041 --> 01:18:28,577
Okay. You wanna put him
in the playpen?

1162
01:18:28,709 --> 01:18:30,077
Yeah. Oh, baby.

1163
01:18:30,211 --> 01:18:31,946
-He's tired.
-Come here.

1164
01:18:32,079 --> 01:18:34,148
Come here, Brody.

1165
01:18:34,281 --> 01:18:37,151
I'll show you pictures of your
mother another day, Brody.

1166
01:18:51,232 --> 01:18:53,834
Hey, Celine, can you please come
back here when you get a chance?

1167
01:18:55,035 --> 01:18:56,470
Yeah.

1168
01:19:00,941 --> 01:19:02,209
Here, sit down.

1169
01:19:03,043 --> 01:19:04,311
Yeah. Okay.

1170
01:19:05,913 --> 01:19:07,948
What did you do
with Fiona's pictures?

1171
01:19:09,149 --> 01:19:12,953
Oh, um, that's right.

1172
01:19:14,755 --> 01:19:15,823
Here.

1173
01:19:16,658 --> 01:19:19,193
Why did you make another booklet
with your pictures in it?

1174
01:19:21,028 --> 01:19:22,664
Excuse me?

1175
01:19:22,796 --> 01:19:24,599
Celine, we both agreed that
you're gonna be Brody's mother,

1176
01:19:24,733 --> 01:19:27,001
but the reason I did this
is so that he can see

1177
01:19:27,134 --> 01:19:28,869
his mother
and remember who she was.

1178
01:19:31,506 --> 01:19:33,207
This has been
hard on me too, Caleb.

1179
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:35,042
Yeah, but this isn't about you.

1180
01:19:35,175 --> 01:19:37,044
You know what?
You never think about how I feel

1181
01:19:37,177 --> 01:19:38,812
or what I've been through.

1182
01:19:42,016 --> 01:19:43,752
Oh my God!

1183
01:20:00,568 --> 01:20:02,236
-Which one would you like?
-I want that one!

1184
01:20:02,369 --> 01:20:04,639
-I want that one!
-That one! I want that one!

1185
01:20:04,773 --> 01:20:06,140
-This one?
-Thank you.

1186
01:20:06,273 --> 01:20:07,975
-You're welcome.
-Yay!

1187
01:20:09,009 --> 01:20:10,477
You want a little turtle?

1188
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:19,788
I want cotton candy.

1189
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:22,256
Okay. Here, honey.
Thanks.

1190
01:20:22,389 --> 01:20:24,391
Yeah. I'll get a punch bowl
for the drink table.

1191
01:20:24,526 --> 01:20:26,193
What do you think?
Strawberry or orange?

1192
01:20:26,327 --> 01:20:28,128
Uh, either one should be fine.

1193
01:20:28,262 --> 01:20:29,863
Oh, and the balloon lady wanted
a bottle of water earlier.

1194
01:20:29,997 --> 01:20:31,533
I totally forgot
to give it to her.

1195
01:20:31,666 --> 01:20:33,233
Can you bring it to her
while they go and get the ice?

1196
01:20:33,367 --> 01:20:34,968
Sure thing.
You know, random thought.

1197
01:20:35,102 --> 01:20:37,037
I was thinking,
why on earth was I not invited

1198
01:20:37,171 --> 01:20:38,540
to your baby shower?
I mean, gosh.

1199
01:20:38,673 --> 01:20:40,407
-I know it was a long time ago--
-Time flies.

1200
01:20:40,542 --> 01:20:43,143
And you never mentioned
about the day you gave birth.

1201
01:20:43,277 --> 01:20:45,780
I mean, you know, us moms
love to indulge in the details.

1202
01:20:45,913 --> 01:20:47,448
Can we talk about this later?

1203
01:20:47,582 --> 01:20:49,183
The kids are lined up
around the block for some punch.

1204
01:20:49,316 --> 01:20:51,318
Okay, we'll catch up later.

1205
01:20:55,055 --> 01:20:57,358
Bitch.

1206
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,663
Miguel, hey.

1207
01:21:01,796 --> 01:21:03,964
I know I haven't called.
I'm so sorry. It's rude of me.

1208
01:21:04,098 --> 01:21:05,533
I should have done it before,
but--

1209
01:21:05,667 --> 01:21:08,536
Don't be silly.
It's good to see you.

1210
01:21:08,902 --> 01:21:10,337
I heard you were in town

1211
01:21:10,471 --> 01:21:12,540
and wanted to know
what you were up to today.

1212
01:21:12,906 --> 01:21:15,275
Um, no real plans. Why?

1213
01:21:15,409 --> 01:21:18,345
Well, Fiona and I always spent
our holiday weekends together.

1214
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:21,014
And I'd be lying if I said
you weren't the next best thing.

1215
01:21:21,148 --> 01:21:23,050
Thanks a lot.

1216
01:21:23,183 --> 01:21:24,552
Plus I haven't seen you
in forever.

1217
01:21:24,686 --> 01:21:26,821
Oh, you are so sweet.

1218
01:21:27,722 --> 01:21:29,791
You know what? I told Caleb
I would go to their block party.

1219
01:21:29,923 --> 01:21:33,494
Caleb? Wait, you met Caleb
and the baby already?

1220
01:21:33,628 --> 01:21:35,129
-Yeah.
-Oh, girl.

1221
01:21:35,262 --> 01:21:36,964
There's so much to catch up on.
Okay, go get ready.

1222
01:21:37,097 --> 01:21:38,232
-We're gonna be late.
-Okay.

1223
01:21:38,365 --> 01:21:40,067
Wait.
Uh, where are we going?

1224
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:41,335
What should I wear?

1225
01:21:41,468 --> 01:21:42,403
-Oh.

1226
01:21:42,537 --> 01:21:45,239
I got you some lashes.
-Oh!

1227
01:21:45,372 --> 01:21:47,374
I was wondering if you
have a bikini to go with them.

1228
01:21:47,509 --> 01:21:49,644
- Hmm?
- Okay.

1229
01:21:49,778 --> 01:21:51,513
Maybe you can
help me pick something out?

1230
01:21:51,646 --> 01:21:53,113
-Yes.
-Okay.

1231
01:22:00,954 --> 01:22:02,256
I would like some.

1232
01:22:02,389 --> 01:22:03,991
Excuse me.
Can I get a beer, please?

1233
01:22:04,124 --> 01:22:06,160
- Oh, yeah. Of course.
- Thank you.

1234
01:22:12,099 --> 01:22:13,835
Mm, that's so strong.

1235
01:22:13,967 --> 01:22:15,670
-Oh, hey, Miguel.
-Hey!

1236
01:22:15,804 --> 01:22:17,304
Oh, girl, you look amazing.

1237
01:22:17,438 --> 01:22:18,740
-Thank you.
-Is all this real?

1238
01:22:18,873 --> 01:22:20,307
Everything but the lashes.

1239
01:22:20,441 --> 01:22:22,476
Okay. Okay.

1240
01:22:26,113 --> 01:22:27,582
Excuse me.

1241
01:22:27,715 --> 01:22:30,785
Get a strap on already. Ugh!

1242
01:22:30,919 --> 01:22:32,587
Never a dull moment, I swear.

1243
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:35,355
Ooh, love this song.
Turn it up.

1244
01:22:41,094 --> 01:22:43,330
Ooh!

1245
01:22:48,101 --> 01:22:49,704
-Hey.
-Hey.

1246
01:22:59,814 --> 01:23:01,014
So you met the baby.

1247
01:23:01,148 --> 01:23:03,918
Yeah.
He's beautiful.

1248
01:23:04,051 --> 01:23:06,253
-Yeah.
-I already love him to death.

1249
01:23:09,289 --> 01:23:12,660
How have you been
dealing with everything?

1250
01:23:13,393 --> 01:23:15,229
Oh, Miguel.
It's been rough.

1251
01:23:15,663 --> 01:23:16,731
Yeah.

1252
01:23:19,466 --> 01:23:21,401
I just feel so guilty.

1253
01:23:21,536 --> 01:23:24,037
I can't believe
I wasn't there for her

1254
01:23:24,171 --> 01:23:26,340
-during her pregnancy.
-No.

1255
01:23:26,473 --> 01:23:29,176
I-I just wish I could have
been with her one more time.

1256
01:23:29,309 --> 01:23:31,078
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1257
01:23:32,479 --> 01:23:35,048
Fiona was the happiest
I had ever seen her.

1258
01:23:35,817 --> 01:23:37,819
I mean, she was
on her way to motherhood.

1259
01:23:37,952 --> 01:23:39,319
She had the man of her dreams.

1260
01:23:39,453 --> 01:23:42,189
And career-wise,
she was at the top of her game.

1261
01:23:43,323 --> 01:23:45,225
I mean,
that counts for something.

1262
01:23:46,226 --> 01:23:47,494
Yeah, it does.

1263
01:23:54,334 --> 01:23:56,236
I prefer you brunette.

1264
01:23:56,838 --> 01:23:58,205
What are you doing here?

1265
01:23:58,338 --> 01:24:01,174
This is a pleasant surprise.

1266
01:24:01,509 --> 01:24:03,110
Do you live close by?

1267
01:24:03,243 --> 01:24:04,812
It's none of your business.

1268
01:24:05,245 --> 01:24:06,548
Look at the balloons.

1269
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:10,417
I miss Mama.

1270
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:13,821
There you go.

1271
01:24:13,955 --> 01:24:15,455
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1272
01:24:16,991 --> 01:24:18,526
Yeah. You good?

1273
01:24:19,092 --> 01:24:22,530
If you have any
more business for me,

1274
01:24:23,463 --> 01:24:25,065
you know the number...

1275
01:24:26,601 --> 01:24:27,735
...pretty lady.

1276
01:24:27,869 --> 01:24:29,202
It was a one-time thing.

1277
01:24:29,336 --> 01:24:30,772
I'm not gonna need
your services again.

1278
01:24:30,905 --> 01:24:33,073
So just walk away

1279
01:24:33,206 --> 01:24:34,742
and pretend
like I don't know you.

1280
01:24:34,876 --> 01:24:38,078
Never... say never.

1281
01:24:51,191 --> 01:24:53,260
Hey. Hey, you okay?

1282
01:24:53,393 --> 01:24:54,696
Who was that
you were talking to?

1283
01:24:54,829 --> 01:24:56,631
Oh, he was just
looking for something.

1284
01:24:56,764 --> 01:24:58,700
I'm starving.
You guys ready to eat?

1285
01:24:58,833 --> 01:25:00,568
Yeah. That cheeseburger
calling my name.

1286
01:25:00,702 --> 01:25:02,436
Do you wanna take him
and I'll make us a plate?

1287
01:25:02,570 --> 01:25:04,338
Yeah.
There you go.

1288
01:25:04,471 --> 01:25:06,440
Let's go.
Let's go get a hot dog.

1289
01:25:06,574 --> 01:25:09,744
Yeah, let's go get a hot dog.

1290
01:25:11,579 --> 01:25:13,748
Can I tell you something?

1291
01:25:13,881 --> 01:25:15,148
Yeah.

1292
01:25:18,452 --> 01:25:22,523
I have had this awful
feeling about her death.

1293
01:25:23,490 --> 01:25:24,892
What do you mean?

1294
01:25:25,026 --> 01:25:27,095
My mom said that
after the labor she was fine.

1295
01:25:27,461 --> 01:25:28,830
Yeah, she was.

1296
01:25:29,631 --> 01:25:32,033
I don't know,
it just doesn't make any sense.

1297
01:25:32,934 --> 01:25:36,604
Something about her death
just feels... off.

1298
01:25:40,642 --> 01:25:42,275
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just trying to

1299
01:25:42,409 --> 01:25:44,311
find something
or someone to blame.

1300
01:25:45,345 --> 01:25:46,814
Well, you can't blame yourself.

1301
01:25:48,549 --> 01:25:50,183
It'll get better.

1302
01:25:54,421 --> 01:25:57,959
Hey, uh. Oh, Doctor,
you, um, you dropped this.

1303
01:25:58,358 --> 01:26:00,061
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1304
01:26:16,811 --> 01:26:19,580
You know,
today really lifted my spirits.

1305
01:26:21,481 --> 01:26:24,384
I think Fiona would've liked
this: Us together.

1306
01:26:24,519 --> 01:26:26,621
I think so too.

1307
01:26:27,021 --> 01:26:28,422
Well, cheers to Fiona.

1308
01:26:29,423 --> 01:26:31,491
Cheers to our angel in heaven.

1309
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,968
-Oh, no.
-What's wrong?

1310
01:26:42,837 --> 01:26:45,439
I just got promoted
to VP of Marketing.

1311
01:26:46,373 --> 01:26:48,776
Congratulations.
That's awesome.

1312
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:52,279
-Why aren't you excited?
-Because they want me

1313
01:26:52,412 --> 01:26:54,148
to come into the office
for half the week.

1314
01:26:54,281 --> 01:26:55,449
Who's gonna watch the baby?

1315
01:26:55,817 --> 01:26:57,151
-I have to say no.
-What?

1316
01:26:57,284 --> 01:26:58,553
No. No. Celine...

1317
01:26:58,953 --> 01:27:01,122
you've been wanting this
for such a long time.

1318
01:27:01,254 --> 01:27:02,557
Yeah, but who's gonna
watch Brody?

1319
01:27:02,690 --> 01:27:04,324
You'll be home half the week.
Okay?

1320
01:27:04,458 --> 01:27:05,793
And I know you
don't wanna hear this,

1321
01:27:05,927 --> 01:27:07,995
but he's got
a family to watch him too.

1322
01:27:09,463 --> 01:27:10,898
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1323
01:27:11,264 --> 01:27:14,702
Come on. He's gonna be
in good hands and you know that.

1324
01:27:15,136 --> 01:27:17,404
Celine, take the position.

1325
01:27:17,538 --> 01:27:18,840
You deserve it.

1326
01:27:20,407 --> 01:27:22,442
It'll be a significant
pay increase.

1327
01:27:22,577 --> 01:27:24,078
And I would finally
be able to manage

1328
01:27:24,212 --> 01:27:26,547
-the direction of the company.
-There you go.

1329
01:27:26,681 --> 01:27:28,415
And maybe after a year,

1330
01:27:28,549 --> 01:27:30,985
they'd allow me to pick
and choose the hours I come in.

1331
01:27:31,519 --> 01:27:34,287
You really think he'll be okay?

1332
01:27:34,421 --> 01:27:35,823
I'm positive.

1333
01:27:38,025 --> 01:27:39,093
Alright.

1334
01:27:39,493 --> 01:27:41,896
I'm gonna say yes.

1335
01:27:44,565 --> 01:27:46,266
Sent.

1336
01:27:46,399 --> 01:27:48,268
Awesome. All right.
Let's go to dinner.

1337
01:27:48,401 --> 01:27:49,737
I'll coordinate with the family

1338
01:27:49,871 --> 01:27:51,139
and I'll text you
Fabiola's number, okay?

1339
01:27:51,839 --> 01:27:54,474
Um, why would I need
Fabiola's number?

1340
01:27:54,842 --> 01:27:56,511
Well, she's gonna
be excited to watch him.

1341
01:27:56,644 --> 01:27:57,912
She's part of the family.

1342
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,482
Mmm! So proud of you.

1343
01:28:11,192 --> 01:28:12,860
Wow.

1344
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:15,428
This is her last collection.

1345
01:28:17,198 --> 01:28:18,966
It's beautiful, Miguel.

1346
01:28:23,436 --> 01:28:25,973
Oh, wait. I'm sorry.
Can I take photos?

1347
01:28:26,107 --> 01:28:27,508
I wanted to show my mom.

1348
01:28:27,642 --> 01:28:30,044
Of course.
Just don't show anyone else.

1349
01:28:30,178 --> 01:28:31,512
You got it.

1350
01:28:31,646 --> 01:28:33,313
This collection's
gonna be such a hit.

1351
01:28:33,446 --> 01:28:34,982
And wait 'til
you see the men's line.

1352
01:28:35,116 --> 01:28:37,317
New York Fashion Week is
two and a half months away.

1353
01:28:37,685 --> 01:28:39,120
And in honor of Fiona,

1354
01:28:39,253 --> 01:28:40,888
the industry's
decided to give her an award.

1355
01:28:41,789 --> 01:28:43,090
I was wondering
if you could be there

1356
01:28:43,224 --> 01:28:44,659
to accept it on her behalf.

1357
01:28:47,394 --> 01:28:49,831
We're also gonna be
featured in <i>Harper's Bazaar,</i>

1358
01:28:49,964 --> 01:28:52,867
and I'll need to book a couple
photographers for that shoot.

1359
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:55,269
-Are you available?
-For this?

1360
01:28:55,402 --> 01:28:57,638
-Absolutely.
-Oh, fantastic.

1361
01:28:57,939 --> 01:29:00,241
I'm also gonna invite the family
and Caleb

1362
01:29:00,373 --> 01:29:01,576
to New York Fashion Week.

1363
01:29:01,709 --> 01:29:03,144
I think it could be a good idea.

1364
01:29:03,277 --> 01:29:05,213
-Miguel, they would love that.
-Okay. Great.

1365
01:29:05,345 --> 01:29:07,582
My assistant booked
a block of rooms at the hotel,

1366
01:29:07,715 --> 01:29:09,317
so just give me
confirmation on who can come.

1367
01:29:09,449 --> 01:29:11,652
-I'm on it.
-Great.

1368
01:29:13,287 --> 01:29:14,387
Can I ask you a favor?

1369
01:29:14,522 --> 01:29:15,790
Yeah.

1370
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:20,728
Do you think after
the show I could keep one?

1371
01:29:21,529 --> 01:29:22,930
Consider it done.

1372
01:29:27,335 --> 01:29:29,704
Yeah. Yeah.

1373
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:33,808
Hey, baby Brody

1374
01:29:33,941 --> 01:29:35,375
- Brody, look who's here.
- Hi.

1375
01:29:35,509 --> 01:29:37,645
-Look who's here.
-Hello.

1376
01:29:38,346 --> 01:29:39,680
Oh.

1377
01:29:40,114 --> 01:29:42,350
Look who's here-- oh!

1378
01:29:42,482 --> 01:29:43,618
Thanks for coming.

1379
01:29:43,751 --> 01:29:46,386
I could use some fresh air.

1380
01:29:51,424 --> 01:29:53,928
-And it's such a beautiful day.
-It is.

1381
01:29:55,462 --> 01:29:56,831
So what were you up to today?

1382
01:29:56,964 --> 01:30:00,034
Oh, I was just at the studio
with Miguel.

1383
01:30:00,701 --> 01:30:02,603
Oh, by the way,
uh, you and the family

1384
01:30:02,737 --> 01:30:04,205
are invited
to New York Fashion Week.

1385
01:30:04,338 --> 01:30:06,741
They're gonna be honoring
my sister with an award

1386
01:30:06,874 --> 01:30:09,110
and I'm gonna be there
to accept it on her behalf.

1387
01:30:09,243 --> 01:30:11,112
Nice! Yeah, send me the dates.

1388
01:30:11,245 --> 01:30:12,580
Yeah.

1389
01:30:12,713 --> 01:30:14,148
Are you--
are you a designer as well?

1390
01:30:14,282 --> 01:30:16,083
No, no.

1391
01:30:16,217 --> 01:30:18,485
I love clothes,
but I can't make 'em.

1392
01:30:18,619 --> 01:30:20,087
I don't even know how to sew.

1393
01:30:21,421 --> 01:30:23,057
Um, but I am in the industry.

1394
01:30:23,190 --> 01:30:25,359
I thought so.
I just wasn't sure.

1395
01:30:25,826 --> 01:30:27,862
I'm a fashion photographer.

1396
01:30:27,995 --> 01:30:29,196
Oh, nice. Yeah.

1397
01:30:29,597 --> 01:30:31,098
And speaking of,

1398
01:30:31,232 --> 01:30:34,135
I have yet to take pictures
of this little guy.

1399
01:30:34,268 --> 01:30:35,870
-Oh.
-Hi.

1400
01:30:36,704 --> 01:30:39,106
Hi, baby.

1401
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:40,875
Oh, wow.

1402
01:30:41,008 --> 01:30:43,210
Yeah. You're a natural.

1403
01:30:44,912 --> 01:30:46,247
You know what, Brody,
if you get the height,

1404
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:47,515
we're gonna put you to work.

1405
01:30:47,648 --> 01:30:49,750
Oh, yes, we will.

1406
01:30:50,217 --> 01:30:51,285
Oh, hey. Hold that.

1407
01:30:51,619 --> 01:30:52,485
Hmm?

1408
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:53,521
Oh.

1409
01:30:54,889 --> 01:30:56,557
You have a really nice features.

1410
01:30:56,691 --> 01:30:57,992
Thank you.

1411
01:30:58,125 --> 01:30:59,593
I, um, I guess
I missed my calling.

1412
01:30:59,727 --> 01:31:01,329
Maybe.

1413
01:31:01,494 --> 01:31:02,396
Here. Brody.

1414
01:31:02,530 --> 01:31:03,931
Hi, baby.

1415
01:31:04,899 --> 01:31:06,400
Can-- can I see that?

1416
01:31:06,534 --> 01:31:07,802
Yeah.

1417
01:31:09,136 --> 01:31:12,106
Oh, wow. These are--
these are pretty amazing.

1418
01:31:13,741 --> 01:31:15,242
Maybe I could be
in the next top model, huh?

1419
01:31:15,376 --> 01:31:17,445
Maybe you can.

1420
01:31:17,578 --> 01:31:19,380
I'll-- I'll call around for you.

1421
01:31:22,450 --> 01:31:23,985
Well, this is a first for me.

1422
01:31:24,118 --> 01:31:26,253
I've never had pizza
delivered at the park before.

1423
01:31:30,558 --> 01:31:32,059
Wow.
This is surreal.

1424
01:31:32,193 --> 01:31:33,260
What is?

1425
01:31:35,329 --> 01:31:39,233
I mean, I'm here with
my sister's baby and with you,

1426
01:31:41,202 --> 01:31:42,937
but she's not with us.

1427
01:31:43,704 --> 01:31:45,373
Yeah. I could've, um,

1428
01:31:45,506 --> 01:31:47,875
never imagined it would've
turned out this way.

1429
01:31:48,009 --> 01:31:49,944
This must be so hard for you.

1430
01:31:51,045 --> 01:31:52,113
And for you too.

1431
01:31:53,814 --> 01:31:56,050
Yeah.

1432
01:31:57,618 --> 01:31:59,387
I'm sorry, I-I gotta get this.
Okay?

1433
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:00,788
Of course.

1434
01:32:01,222 --> 01:32:02,223
Hello?

1435
01:32:02,356 --> 01:32:03,624
Yes. This is Caleb.

1436
01:32:07,695 --> 01:32:09,096
What?

1437
01:32:09,230 --> 01:32:10,965
No, no, no.
The-- the owner of the building

1438
01:32:11,098 --> 01:32:12,733
told me it was
an electrical shortage.

1439
01:32:15,703 --> 01:32:16,971
Are you sure?

1440
01:32:17,972 --> 01:32:21,142
Please, if you find out
anything else, let me know.

1441
01:32:36,323 --> 01:32:37,358
Is everything okay?

1442
01:32:38,092 --> 01:32:40,227
That was an arson investigator.

1443
01:32:40,361 --> 01:32:42,630
He said that the fire
at Fiona's baby shower

1444
01:32:42,763 --> 01:32:44,298
was due to arson.

1445
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:46,734
I told him,
"No, you must be confused

1446
01:32:46,867 --> 01:32:48,969
because the owner
of the building told me

1447
01:32:49,103 --> 01:32:50,971
that it was an electrical
shortage."

1448
01:32:53,707 --> 01:32:55,609
And he said
that I was misinformed.

1449
01:32:56,577 --> 01:32:57,845
Oh my God.

1450
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:01,315
Oh my God.
I just got chills.

1451
01:33:01,449 --> 01:33:03,217
And that there's no leads and...

1452
01:33:04,151 --> 01:33:06,287
that the case might
come to a close.

1453
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:09,290
Wait. So do they think
it was, like, a fluke thing?

1454
01:33:09,423 --> 01:33:10,691
Like an accident?

1455
01:33:10,825 --> 01:33:12,793
Or they think
it was intentional?

1456
01:33:12,927 --> 01:33:15,096
No.
Uh, arson is no accident.

1457
01:33:15,229 --> 01:33:18,032
I know, but that
doesn't make any sense.

1458
01:33:18,165 --> 01:33:20,868
I mean, who would do something
like that intentionally,

1459
01:33:21,001 --> 01:33:23,204
and at a baby shower no less?

1460
01:33:25,339 --> 01:33:26,974
I don't know.
But I'm gonna find out.

1461
01:33:28,175 --> 01:33:29,610
<i>It does seem odd,</i>

1462
01:33:29,743 --> 01:33:31,378
<i>but it's not exactly proof.</i>

1463
01:33:31,513 --> 01:33:34,782
<i>If she was behind this,</i>
<i>you'll find out eventually.</i>

1464
01:33:34,915 --> 01:33:37,051
<i>But I don't know, man.</i>
<i>Arson?</i>

1465
01:33:37,184 --> 01:33:38,886
<i>Doesn't sound like Celine.</i>

1466
01:33:39,019 --> 01:33:40,788
Well, she vandalized
her house during that time.

1467
01:33:40,921 --> 01:33:43,791
She was--
she was acting pretty crazy.

1468
01:33:43,924 --> 01:33:46,393
Allen] <i>Yeah. You both</i>
<i>have been through a lot.</i>

1469
01:33:46,528 --> 01:33:50,798
I wouldn't stir the pot unless
it's absolutely necessary.

1470
01:33:50,931 --> 01:33:53,167
Yeah. Yeah. You're right, man.
Thanks.

1471
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:54,569
All right.
We'll talk later, okay?

1472
01:34:15,656 --> 01:34:17,291
Any movement,
make the call out.

1473
01:34:17,424 --> 01:34:18,726
Copy that.

1474
01:34:33,207 --> 01:34:36,944
Do not drop.
Do not drop.

1475
01:34:37,845 --> 01:34:39,113
Damn it!

1476
01:34:42,917 --> 01:34:47,054
Suspect has fled
in a black vehicle headed south.

1477
01:35:03,370 --> 01:35:05,206
Yeah, we--
we've been over this.

1478
01:35:05,339 --> 01:35:07,007
<i>Can you come back early?</i>

1479
01:35:07,141 --> 01:35:08,643
<i>Why spend</i>
<i>two extra days in New York?</i>

1480
01:35:08,776 --> 01:35:10,978
Because I could really
use the break.

1481
01:35:11,546 --> 01:35:13,914
I invited you to come,
and you still can.

1482
01:35:17,384 --> 01:35:20,387
What? What was that?
It's really loud in here.

1483
01:35:20,522 --> 01:35:21,855
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1484
01:35:21,989 --> 01:35:23,457
We'll talk soon. Okay?

1485
01:35:28,530 --> 01:35:29,830
Ooh, those are great.

1486
01:35:29,964 --> 01:35:32,199
-Yes. Ah!
-Nice. Huh?

1487
01:35:32,333 --> 01:35:33,934
-I love that one.
-Yeah.

1488
01:35:34,235 --> 01:35:35,869
Ooh,
I think they're ready for us.

1489
01:35:36,003 --> 01:35:37,404
Oh, okay.

1490
01:35:37,539 --> 01:35:38,839
Alright. Well,
we're gonna head backstage,

1491
01:35:38,973 --> 01:35:40,441
-but enjoy the show.
-I will.

1492
01:35:52,052 --> 01:35:53,320
There you are.
There you are. Okay.

1493
01:35:53,454 --> 01:35:55,322
Um, male model,
I forgot his name.

1494
01:35:55,456 --> 01:35:57,258
-Um, number three--
-What? Spit it out.

1495
01:35:57,391 --> 01:35:59,561
-He didn't show up.
-And you're telling me this now?

1496
01:35:59,694 --> 01:36:01,696
I think he's hungover
from last night or something.

1497
01:36:01,862 --> 01:36:03,264
I don't care.
What about Eric?

1498
01:36:03,397 --> 01:36:05,099
-Can't he just--
-No, we tried that.

1499
01:36:05,232 --> 01:36:06,601
He's first in their segment
and it's not gonna work.

1500
01:36:07,201 --> 01:36:08,869
-Fabiola?
-Yes.

1501
01:36:09,003 --> 01:36:11,005
Male model, waist size 32.
Do you know anyone?

1502
01:36:11,138 --> 01:36:12,741
We need him in makeup
in five minutes.

1503
01:36:13,274 --> 01:36:15,976
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll be right back.

1504
01:36:16,910 --> 01:36:18,412
-Go do something.
-Okay.

1505
01:36:21,048 --> 01:36:23,951
Hey, um, could I actually
borrow you for a minute?

1506
01:36:24,084 --> 01:36:25,152
-Yeah, of course.
-Okay.

1507
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:27,522
Um, are you guys
sure you want me?

1508
01:36:27,656 --> 01:36:29,223
I-I am not a model.

1509
01:36:29,356 --> 01:36:31,992
You can pretend to be.
And don't be so stiff. Relax.

1510
01:36:32,126 --> 01:36:33,561
They'll show you how to do it.

1511
01:36:33,695 --> 01:36:35,162
-Just good call, Fabiola.
-You'll be great.

1512
01:36:35,296 --> 01:36:37,064
-Shot?
-Yes, please.

1513
01:36:37,732 --> 01:36:38,966
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1514
01:36:41,368 --> 01:36:42,704
Oh God.

1515
01:36:43,237 --> 01:36:45,607
God, that's strong.

1516
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:46,807
-Oh my God.
-Showtime.

1517
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:48,275
Okay, let's go.
You ready?

1518
01:36:48,976 --> 01:36:50,277
Okay.

1519
01:36:51,011 --> 01:36:52,212
God, I hope he doesn't trip.

1520
01:38:22,537 --> 01:38:25,072
For the most
innovative, creative,

1521
01:38:25,205 --> 01:38:27,842
and inspiring fashions
of the year,

1522
01:38:27,975 --> 01:38:29,844
I present Miguel Munoz

1523
01:38:29,977 --> 01:38:34,114
and the late Fiona Hernandez
of Spark Fashion Line,

1524
01:38:34,248 --> 01:38:38,085
this award
for Designer of the Year.

1525
01:38:38,653 --> 01:38:41,355
Fiona's sister,
Fabiola Hernandez

1526
01:38:41,488 --> 01:38:43,257
is here to accept the award.

1527
01:38:47,762 --> 01:38:49,163
Thank you.

1528
01:38:52,901 --> 01:38:56,805
Oh my God. I-I was so
nervous, but I-I did my best.

1529
01:38:56,937 --> 01:38:59,674
Oh, I know. I was like, who is
that coming outta nowhere?

1530
01:38:59,808 --> 01:39:02,209
-You were fantastic.
-You did so great.

1531
01:39:02,342 --> 01:39:04,445
Yeah. And you picked
up that walk so fast.

1532
01:39:04,579 --> 01:39:06,413
-Thank you.
-Oh, you were fierce.

1533
01:39:08,616 --> 01:39:09,818
Good evening.

1534
01:39:09,950 --> 01:39:12,085
This show was fantastic.

1535
01:39:12,219 --> 01:39:13,555
Thank you.

1536
01:39:13,688 --> 01:39:14,923
It was phenomenal.

1537
01:39:15,055 --> 01:39:17,090
Let's set up something.
Let's talk.

1538
01:39:17,224 --> 01:39:18,258
Of-- of course.

1539
01:39:18,392 --> 01:39:19,960
Have a wonderful night.

1540
01:39:20,093 --> 01:39:21,361
- Thank you.
- You too.

1541
01:39:25,065 --> 01:39:27,100
I think I'm gonna faint.

1542
01:39:27,234 --> 01:39:29,704
-Oh, my God!
-What? Who was that?

1543
01:39:31,038 --> 01:39:32,272
Frederic Raphael.

1544
01:39:32,406 --> 01:39:33,575
What--

1545
01:39:33,708 --> 01:39:35,677
He's one of the hottest
designers right now.

1546
01:39:35,810 --> 01:39:38,646
The hottest. Oh my gosh.
Well, this is unreal.

1547
01:39:38,780 --> 01:39:39,848
Amazing.

1548
01:40:23,056 --> 01:40:24,659
Okay.

1549
01:40:24,792 --> 01:40:28,328
This guy is officially obsessed
with the Hernandez family.

1550
01:40:30,899 --> 01:40:31,799
Mm.

1551
01:40:31,933 --> 01:40:33,200
Damn!

1552
01:40:59,594 --> 01:41:01,729
That was a nice hotel, huh?

1553
01:41:01,863 --> 01:41:03,130
Yeah.

1554
01:41:04,599 --> 01:41:06,333
I'm really glad you came out.

1555
01:41:06,466 --> 01:41:08,402
I had a great time
with the show and--

1556
01:41:08,536 --> 01:41:10,404
-and getting to know you.
-Yeah, me too.

1557
01:41:10,538 --> 01:41:12,840
I'm definitely gonna add,
uh, modeling to my resume now.

1558
01:41:15,442 --> 01:41:17,812
This is one of the best weekends
I've had in a long time.

1559
01:41:18,178 --> 01:41:20,682
Yeah.
Just wish it didn't have to end.

1560
01:41:21,883 --> 01:41:23,317
Yeah.

1561
01:41:23,450 --> 01:41:25,753
Um, so, you know,
maybe we can do some lunch

1562
01:41:25,887 --> 01:41:27,454
or coffee back in LA?

1563
01:41:28,022 --> 01:41:30,324
Yeah.
And you'd bring Brody.

1564
01:41:30,457 --> 01:41:31,859
Yeah.
He would love that.

1565
01:41:34,696 --> 01:41:37,031
Oh, it looks
like that's your taxi.

1566
01:41:37,164 --> 01:41:38,766
Yeah.
Alright. Well, I'll--

1567
01:41:38,900 --> 01:41:40,100
I'll see you back.

1568
01:41:40,233 --> 01:41:41,803
Um, have a safe flight.
Okay?

1569
01:41:41,936 --> 01:41:43,605
Okay. You too.

1570
01:41:55,182 --> 01:41:56,618
I couldn't be happier.

1571
01:41:56,751 --> 01:41:58,452
I mean, sales
are already through the roof.

1572
01:41:58,586 --> 01:42:00,287
I know. Ever since
the photo shoot was published,

1573
01:42:00,420 --> 01:42:02,356
I've been getting
calls from all over.

1574
01:42:02,489 --> 01:42:04,092
Right on, girlfriend.

1575
01:42:08,261 --> 01:42:09,664
Okay.
Now for the nitty gritty.

1576
01:42:09,797 --> 01:42:11,465
What the fuck
is up with you and Caleb?

1577
01:42:11,833 --> 01:42:14,569
I can't even believe I'm having
this conversation right now.

1578
01:42:15,103 --> 01:42:17,639
Oh my God, this is so weird.

1579
01:42:17,772 --> 01:42:20,407
Okay. First of all,
you cannot tell anyone.

1580
01:42:20,541 --> 01:42:22,744
You sound like Fiona.

1581
01:42:22,877 --> 01:42:25,780
Oh my God. I know. We always
had the same taste in men.

1582
01:42:25,913 --> 01:42:27,314
I remember, girl.

1583
01:42:27,849 --> 01:42:31,151
Look, but the second thing is,
I am not seeing him, okay?

1584
01:42:31,284 --> 01:42:35,857
I am not about to let this guy
have an ongoing affair again.

1585
01:42:36,490 --> 01:42:38,593
That chick better
have a side piece by now.

1586
01:42:40,061 --> 01:42:41,328
He's a catch.

1587
01:42:41,763 --> 01:42:44,231
I can see why my sister
was hung up on him.

1588
01:42:46,433 --> 01:42:48,970
This is like the never-ending
soap opera.

1589
01:42:49,103 --> 01:42:51,438
I mean, what is this guy's
dick made of? Gold?

1590
01:42:51,572 --> 01:42:55,308
-Hey, I did not sleep with him.
-Yet.

1591
01:42:58,046 --> 01:42:59,747
Deja fucking vu.

1592
01:43:03,051 --> 01:43:04,752
So how's that new position
at work coming along?

1593
01:43:04,886 --> 01:43:07,789
Uh, it's demanding
and challenging at times.

1594
01:43:07,922 --> 01:43:11,025
But the, uh, creative freedom
makes it enjoyable.

1595
01:43:11,159 --> 01:43:12,192
Nice.

1596
01:43:14,128 --> 01:43:15,596
You want seconds?

1597
01:43:15,730 --> 01:43:17,031
Yeah, sure.

1598
01:43:17,165 --> 01:43:19,433
I mean, well, I'm a little full,
but yeah, why not?

1599
01:43:19,567 --> 01:43:20,968
These are really good.

1600
01:43:21,102 --> 01:43:23,137
Thank you, sweetie.
I appreciate it. Okay?

1601
01:43:23,503 --> 01:43:25,405
<i>And now for our top story.</i>

1602
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:27,909
<i>A local doctor makes America's</i>
<i>Most Wanted list</i>

1603
01:43:28,042 --> 01:43:29,911
<i>for the murder</i>
<i>of one of his patients.</i>

1604
01:43:30,044 --> 01:43:33,081
<i>Dr. Simon Smith, who worked</i>

1607

1608

1609
01:43:46,127 --> 01:43:47,662
Are you hearing this?

1610
01:43:48,428 --> 01:43:50,363
That doctor
is wanted for murder.

1611
01:43:51,199 --> 01:43:52,700
That's terrible.

1612
01:43:53,034 --> 01:43:55,703
Yeah.
He murdered one of his patients.

1613
01:43:56,571 --> 01:43:59,272
And it's at the same hospital
that Brody was born at.

1614
01:44:00,141 --> 01:44:01,341
Was he an obstetrician?

1615
01:44:01,776 --> 01:44:03,410
No, I don't-- I don't think so.

1616
01:44:03,544 --> 01:44:06,246
But I feel like
I've seen him somewhere.

1617
01:44:07,148 --> 01:44:08,583
Really? Where?

1618
01:44:08,716 --> 01:44:11,953
I don't know.
He just looks really familiar.

1619
01:44:13,286 --> 01:44:14,789
That happened to me once.

1620
01:44:14,922 --> 01:44:18,358
I kept thinking that
I saw someone wanted for murder.

1621
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:20,728
Strange how the mind works.

1622
01:44:21,829 --> 01:44:23,765
I was just hoping
you know that I saw him

1623
01:44:25,432 --> 01:44:27,635
'cause people like that
deserve to be caught.

1624
01:44:28,836 --> 01:44:30,872
What a crazy ass
world we live in.

1625
01:44:31,005 --> 01:44:33,674
-I hope they catch his ass.
-Me too.

1626
01:45:25,626 --> 01:45:27,360
Hey, babe.

1627
01:45:27,494 --> 01:45:28,763
Hey.

1628
01:45:29,964 --> 01:45:32,099
- Is he asleep?
- No, he's uh, with Elena.

1629
01:45:32,233 --> 01:45:34,168
- Oh.
- Come sit down.

1630
01:45:34,735 --> 01:45:36,671
Okay.

1631
01:45:37,672 --> 01:45:39,273
Oh, this looks amazing.

1632
01:45:39,406 --> 01:45:41,809
I love it when you cook.

1633
01:45:41,943 --> 01:45:45,847
May I?

1634
01:45:45,980 --> 01:45:47,380
Yes, please.

1635
01:45:48,749 --> 01:45:49,984
Hmm.

1636
01:46:05,967 --> 01:46:07,034
Try some.

1637
01:46:14,775 --> 01:46:16,043
How do you like it?

1638
01:46:16,777 --> 01:46:18,512
It's delicious.

1639
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:19,947
Okay.

1640
01:46:20,882 --> 01:46:23,584
Celine,

1641
01:46:25,686 --> 01:46:27,321
how do you know Dr. Smith?

1642
01:46:27,454 --> 01:46:30,892
Who?

1643
01:46:31,025 --> 01:46:32,693
Don't act stupid.

1644
01:46:33,794 --> 01:46:36,030
I-- I don't know
who you're talking about.

1645
01:46:36,163 --> 01:46:38,065
I want you to be honest.

1646
01:46:38,933 --> 01:46:41,135
I am.
I don't know a Dr. Smith.

1647
01:46:41,468 --> 01:46:42,803
Hmm.

1648
01:46:42,937 --> 01:46:44,572
He's the man
that's wanted for murder.

1649
01:46:44,705 --> 01:46:47,642
I saw you talking
to him at the block party.

1650
01:46:49,510 --> 01:46:51,712
Um, you lost me.

1651
01:46:52,346 --> 01:46:53,948
Cut the shit, Celine.

1652
01:46:54,615 --> 01:46:55,983
You were talking to him

1653
01:46:56,117 --> 01:46:58,219
and it wasn't
about fucking decorations.

1654
01:46:58,586 --> 01:47:01,923
He was the man wearing
the blue Hawaiian shirt.

1655
01:47:03,391 --> 01:47:06,594
Uh, that guy.
Um, yeah.

1656
01:47:06,727 --> 01:47:08,396
Uh, uh, he was looking
for something.

1657
01:47:08,529 --> 01:47:12,667
I remember him because he had
a bottle of wine for the booth.

1658
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:14,735
I-I don't remember him

1659
01:47:14,869 --> 01:47:17,104
and I certainly
didn't know he was a doctor.

1660
01:47:17,238 --> 01:47:19,006
He said something to you

1661
01:47:19,140 --> 01:47:22,777
and I noticed
because you gave him that look.

1662
01:47:23,878 --> 01:47:26,479
The same look
you're giving me right now.

1663
01:47:26,614 --> 01:47:29,650
So I'm gonna
ask you one more time.

1664
01:47:30,718 --> 01:47:33,220
How the fuck
do you know Dr. Smith?

1665
01:47:33,354 --> 01:47:34,822
I don't know him.

1666
01:47:35,556 --> 01:47:37,992
You're fucking lying to me.

1667
01:47:38,125 --> 01:47:40,460
Let me go, please. Stop.
Stop, Caleb.

1668
01:47:40,594 --> 01:47:41,862
You're not gonna leave this
house

1669
01:47:41,996 --> 01:47:43,764
until you
tell me the truth!

1670
01:47:43,898 --> 01:47:45,633
Caleb, please, let me go.
Please, let me go.

1671
01:47:45,766 --> 01:47:47,935
Please, let me go. Please.

1672
01:47:58,179 --> 01:47:59,847
What did you give me?

1673
01:48:00,715 --> 01:48:03,084
It's gonna wear off
in a few hours, okay?

1674
01:48:06,253 --> 01:48:07,455
You drugged me.

1675
01:48:07,588 --> 01:48:09,724
I'm sorry, baby.

1676
01:48:09,857 --> 01:48:12,193
Just tell me the truth.

1677
01:48:12,326 --> 01:48:13,728
Tell me what happened, okay?

1678
01:48:13,861 --> 01:48:16,797
And then we can
go pick up Brody.

1679
01:48:16,931 --> 01:48:18,199
Huh?

1680
01:48:19,767 --> 01:48:21,736
I didn't wanna do it.

1681
01:48:22,870 --> 01:48:27,008
I just wanted you back
and I wanted to have our baby.

1682
01:48:31,112 --> 01:48:33,547
I paid Dr. Smith
to take Fiona out.

1683
01:48:33,681 --> 01:48:37,818
I did it. I did it for us.

1684
01:48:37,952 --> 01:48:40,788
You are happy, Caleb.
I know that you are.

1685
01:48:40,921 --> 01:48:43,591
And-- and--
and it is in the past.

1686
01:48:43,724 --> 01:48:46,427
And I'm not a murderer.
I'm not a bad person.

1687
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:48,629
Oh, Celine.

1688
01:48:50,331 --> 01:48:55,136
I'm so sorry
if I caused you to be this.

1689
01:48:55,636 --> 01:48:56,871
Untie me.

1690
01:48:57,004 --> 01:48:58,672
We don't have to tell anyone.

1691
01:48:58,806 --> 01:49:03,310
We can, um,
we can move past this.

1692
01:49:04,779 --> 01:49:05,880
And the fire?

1693
01:49:06,013 --> 01:49:08,883
I-I didn't wanna hurt anyone.

1694
01:49:09,016 --> 01:49:10,484
I just wanted to scare them.

1695
01:49:16,257 --> 01:49:17,992
She was pregnant.

1696
01:49:19,393 --> 01:49:20,795
You could have killed my son.

1697
01:49:20,928 --> 01:49:24,799
You could have killed my son,
you crazy bitch.

1698
01:49:28,202 --> 01:49:29,637
Oh my God.

1699
01:49:29,770 --> 01:49:33,107
You killed Fiona.
You killed my wife.

1700
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:37,378
I'm your wife,
right here in front of you.

1701
01:49:37,778 --> 01:49:40,347
We have a beautiful family.

1702
01:49:41,615 --> 01:49:43,284
What was your plan, Celine?
Huh?

1703
01:49:43,417 --> 01:49:45,453
What do you think?
When they catch the doctor,

1704
01:49:45,586 --> 01:49:47,621
what do you think,
he wasn't gonna sell you out?

1705
01:49:47,755 --> 01:49:49,690
So what?
Are you gonna go to the police?

1706
01:49:51,225 --> 01:49:53,761
I am leaving,
and I'm taking Brody with me.

1707
01:49:53,894 --> 01:49:55,763
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Caleb.

1708
01:49:55,896 --> 01:49:57,298
Caleb, please.
You can't. You can't.

1709
01:49:57,431 --> 01:49:59,100
You can't take
Brody from me, please.

1710
01:49:59,233 --> 01:50:02,236
Please. I'm-- I'm--
I'm his mother. I'm his mother.

1711
01:50:02,369 --> 01:50:04,972
I'm sure he is gonna be
thrilled to learn

1712
01:50:05,106 --> 01:50:07,675
that his mother is no
longer here because of you!

1713
01:50:07,808 --> 01:50:10,911
I was taking my life back.

1714
01:50:13,180 --> 01:50:15,716
That bitch
got what she deserved.

1715
01:50:16,851 --> 01:50:18,919
You should rot in hell.

1716
01:50:19,053 --> 01:50:21,489
Caleb. Caleb, please.

1717
01:50:21,622 --> 01:50:24,925
You love me.
I know that you do.

1718
01:50:29,263 --> 01:50:30,898
How could I ever forgive you?

1719
01:50:31,031 --> 01:50:33,734
You murdered my angel.

1720
01:50:35,636 --> 01:50:37,338
So you're gonna tell her family?

1721
01:50:38,939 --> 01:50:42,943
No. And not because
I wanna save your sorry ass.

1722
01:50:43,077 --> 01:50:45,713
Because this would crush them.

1723
01:50:46,515 --> 01:50:48,048
I'm done with you.

1724
01:50:48,182 --> 01:50:51,819
I'm done
with everything, Celine.

1725
01:50:51,952 --> 01:50:56,525
No. No, no, no, no.

1726
01:50:56,657 --> 01:50:59,160
Caleb. Caleb. Caleb. Caleb.

1727
01:50:59,293 --> 01:51:02,863
Caleb! Caleb.
Caleb, please come back!

1728
01:51:02,997 --> 01:51:06,568
Caleb, no! No, Caleb, no.

1729
01:51:06,700 --> 01:51:10,471
No! No! No!

1730
01:51:10,605 --> 01:51:13,941
Caleb! Caleb!

1731
01:51:14,074 --> 01:51:17,845
Caleb, please
don't leave me alone.

1732
01:51:17,978 --> 01:51:20,014
Please don't
leave me alone, Caleb.

1733
01:51:20,147 --> 01:51:22,449
Please don't leave me alone.

1734
01:51:32,793 --> 01:51:34,563
Daddy, daddy,
look what I can do.

1735
01:51:34,695 --> 01:51:37,865
How about
we show your daddy outside?

1736
01:51:37,998 --> 01:51:39,733
Why?
Because I might break something?

1737
01:51:39,867 --> 01:51:41,302
-That's right, buttercup.
-Exactly.

1738
01:51:41,435 --> 01:51:44,038
-Good morning, sunshine.
-Good morning, baby.

1739
01:51:44,606 --> 01:51:46,407
Couldn't wait
to put on your costume, huh?

1740
01:51:46,541 --> 01:51:47,942
He is very excited.

1741
01:51:48,075 --> 01:51:49,578
Come on, Daddy.
Let's go play outside.

1742
01:51:49,710 --> 01:51:51,078
All right. You go first.
All right?

1743
01:51:51,212 --> 01:51:53,047
Remember what I taught you,
okay? Let's go.

1744
01:51:54,815 --> 01:51:57,318
You've been practicing.
Let's show Daddy.

1745
01:51:58,052 --> 01:52:00,020
Future champion right here.

1746
01:52:04,225 --> 01:52:05,694
All right, Brody, you ready?

1747
01:52:05,826 --> 01:52:06,961
Everything I've been teaching
you.

1748
01:52:07,094 --> 01:52:09,063
All right. Here we go. Let's go.

1749
01:52:10,497 --> 01:52:12,266
Yes. Good job. You see?

1750
01:52:12,399 --> 01:52:14,603
You got the-- you almost
got the spin right there.

1751
01:52:14,735 --> 01:52:15,836
-Good job!
-Here we go.

1752
01:52:15,970 --> 01:52:18,072
Yes! Good job.

1753
01:52:22,042 --> 01:52:24,044
Yes! Yes. Good job.

1754
01:52:24,178 --> 01:52:25,779
Look, one-handed like daddy.

1755
01:52:25,913 --> 01:52:27,716
Oh, that takes
a little bit longer at practice.

1756
01:52:27,848 --> 01:52:29,049
Good job, dude.

1757
01:53:05,219 --> 01:53:09,123
<i>Oh, yes. Good job.</i>
<i>Here. Go catch. Oh, good catch.</i>

1758
01:53:09,256 --> 01:53:10,991
You're doing so good, Brody.

1759
01:53:11,125 --> 01:53:12,826
Yes. Just by the laces
like I taught you. Yes.

1760
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:17,031
Daddy is showing off.

1761
01:53:17,164 --> 01:53:20,200
Yeah.
