1
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:35,815
One stiff
blunt force trauma to the head.

2
00:03:35,817 --> 00:03:40,318
Repeated strikes,
lots of damage.

3
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,622
Anything else?

4
00:03:43,124 --> 00:03:45,490
No signs of forced entry.

5
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:48,361
And a witness gave us
a description of the perp.

6
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:53,467
Anything else?

7
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,468
Possible motive?

8
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,105
Enemies, that kinda thing?

9
00:03:59,107 --> 00:04:02,340
Neighbors said he pretty much
kept to himself.

10
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,343
There was a divorce
a while back.

11
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,682
But other than that,
seems pretty quiet.

12
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,920
What's the story on the perp?

13
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,322
A witness said
he walked out the front door,

14
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:18,960
got in his car and drove off.

15
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,961
Description?

16
00:04:21,963 --> 00:04:24,331
White, paunchy.

17
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:27,533
Diseased-looking.

18
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:30,470
Guess he kinda had a blank look
like nobody was home.

19
00:04:31,906 --> 00:04:33,739
Jennings?

20
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:36,711
Absolute waste of space
if you ask me.

21
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:39,614
How so?

22
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:42,548
Just look at the guy.

23
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,884
I can't say I
know the man.

24
00:04:44,886 --> 00:04:47,285
Any details
you may have about Murray,

25
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,623
his behavior, his demeanor
would be really helpful to us.

26
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,293
Relax, lady. I'm getting there.

27
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,062
He wasn't exactly
what you would call

28
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:59,297
an outgoing type.

29
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,870
Kept to himself and quiet.

30
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:07,173
Head down.

31
00:05:07,175 --> 00:05:09,474
Hey, does knowing all this shit
really help you guys?

32
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,311
Maybe.

33
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:15,080
Could have fooled me.

34
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:17,516
You mentioned
that you let Mr. Jennings go.

35
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:18,886
What was the reason behind that?

36
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,087
Uh.

37
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:25,090
He was coming in late
and not doing any work.

38
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:28,093
Hell, one day
he stayed in the same spot,

39
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:29,360
several hours.

40
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,396
Didn't move.

41
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:33,966
Didn't say a fucking word.

42
00:05:33,968 --> 00:05:35,903
Did he have
a history of drug abuse?

43
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:39,171
How the hell would I know?

44
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:40,840
I'm not his bed buddy.

45
00:05:40,842 --> 00:05:43,075
Newsflash, lady. I'm a busy guy.

46
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:45,911
I don't have time
to babysit fuck nuts.

47
00:05:45,913 --> 00:05:47,114
Clearly.

48
00:05:49,884 --> 00:05:51,986
Do you have any footage
of this incident?

49
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:54,856
Of course.

50
00:05:57,124 --> 00:05:58,458
Right this way.

51
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,865
It's right there.

52
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:06,934
I like to keep, uh

53
00:06:07,902 --> 00:06:09,036
up to date.

54
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:16,342
If there's anything you need,
Detective, just let me know.

55
00:06:16,344 --> 00:06:19,412
I'll be more than happy to, uh

56
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:23,818
give you all I got, Detective.

57
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,555
Thank you very much.

58
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:31,590
We'll reach out if we need
any further information.

59
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,826
Oh, please do.

60
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:37,798
Talking to you two
has been an absolute slice.

61
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,197
Anything interesting?

62
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:56,237
Jack shit.

63
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:34,141
How're you holding up?

64
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,179
I don't know
what the fuck that was.

65
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,181
Some weird shit.

66
00:09:42,183 --> 00:09:44,750
I've never seen
anything like that.

67
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:47,286
And what the fuck
were those things?

68
00:09:47,288 --> 00:09:49,223
The lab should have
something for us soon.

69
00:09:52,293 --> 00:09:54,393
Hey.

70
00:09:54,395 --> 00:09:55,996
Be thankful that's the worst
thing you've seen.

71
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:58,232
Yeah.

72
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,679
Have a

73
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:14,181
good night.

74
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:22,790
You okay?

75
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,026
What?

76
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:28,362
You okay?

77
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:32,233
Yeah, yeah,
yeah. I'm fine.

78
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:36,503
You got some vacation time

79
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:39,106
coming soon, right?

80
00:10:40,341 --> 00:10:41,675
Why?

81
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:46,280
I thought we might as well
take a trip somewhere.

82
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:50,550
I was thinking Alaska.

83
00:10:50,552 --> 00:10:52,820
You know,
see some of the old sites.

84
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:56,323
Again?

85
00:10:58,527 --> 00:11:00,394
Yeah. Again.

86
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:05,299
I, um...

87
00:11:07,268 --> 00:11:09,737
I... I just
don't have the time.

88
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:25,851
The ski equipment is,
uh, cluttering the garage.

89
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:28,822
Um, do you mind moving it?

90
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,695
Maybe we should
just toss it out.

91
00:11:41,636 --> 00:11:43,370
Just get rid of it like that?

92
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:48,876
Mm-hmm.

93
00:11:59,654 --> 00:12:01,021
Oh, my God.

94
00:13:23,705 --> 00:13:25,139
What is shyness?

95
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:29,575
Shyness is the idea
that you cannot

96
00:13:29,577 --> 00:13:32,244
or should not
do something.

97
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:35,914
Shyness is the repression
of the soul.

98
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,052
Repression, plain and simple.

99
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:42,689
So how does one deal
with the repression

100
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:44,291
of one's very being?

101
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,227
Is there a way out?

102
00:13:49,564 --> 00:13:51,298
I'm here to tell you, yes.

103
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:53,834
There is a way out.

104
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:56,538
Step one.

105
00:13:57,572 --> 00:13:59,873
You must act first.

106
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,155
Detective Williams.

107
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:19,157
I hope I'm not in trouble.

108
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:22,094
I just have a few questions,
Mr. Corvath.

109
00:14:22,096 --> 00:14:23,962
Perhaps this can
be done another time.

110
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:25,397
The... The doctor is very busy.

111
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,734
I'm happy to help
in whatever way I can.

112
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:30,536
We have a prior engagement,
so we're a bit rushed.

113
00:14:30,538 --> 00:14:32,373
This won't take long.

114
00:14:34,609 --> 00:14:37,142
This man Burt Jennings

115
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:40,078
is wanted
in connection to a murder.

116
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,282
He was in possession
of one of your books.

117
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:45,484
Had attended a seminar.

118
00:14:45,486 --> 00:14:48,755
Just wanted to know
if you've had any contact

119
00:14:48,757 --> 00:14:50,090
or any information.

120
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:53,559
I am afraid
I won't be able to help you.

121
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:55,162
I don't recognize him.

122
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:57,697
Well, if you can
think of anything

123
00:14:57,699 --> 00:14:59,299
that might help us

124
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,502
here's my card.

125
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:06,204
Okay.

126
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:07,906
Thank you very much,
Detective Williams.

127
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:11,445
Uh, if I think of anything,
you'll be the first to know.

128
00:15:12,514 --> 00:15:15,247
Oh, uh, detective.

129
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:17,249
I just wanted to thank you
for coming today.

130
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:20,387
I hope it was helpful.

131
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,560
We'll see, Doctor.

132
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,233
Hello there, folks.

133
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:36,604
One at a time, please.

134
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:48,413
Ladies and gentlemen, the doctor
has a prior engagement,

135
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:50,182
so we'll have
to call in the night early.

136
00:15:50,184 --> 00:15:51,519
Thank you so much for coming.

137
00:16:09,203 --> 00:16:10,572
Excuse me, sir.

138
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:14,807
Uh, I see you're already
following step one.

139
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:17,075
Uh, yeah, I guess so.

140
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:18,945
Uh, anyway, I just,
I had a couple questions

141
00:16:18,947 --> 00:16:20,378
about the program.

142
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,682
Uh, it's pretty simple,
just step by step.

143
00:16:22,684 --> 00:16:23,982
No, I... I get that.

144
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:27,185
But, um,
what is the success rate like

145
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:31,223
for someone with severe shyness
and social anxiety?

146
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:33,626
Don't think about success rates.

147
00:16:33,628 --> 00:16:37,563
Keep the technicalities
out of it and just focus on you.

148
00:16:37,565 --> 00:16:40,633
This is about finding ways
to pull yourself out,

149
00:16:40,635 --> 00:16:43,337
not rates and numbers.

150
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:48,273
Success is totally up to you.

151
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:51,276
If you rate your success
by whether you can chat

152
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:54,881
with a perfect stranger
about the weather or

153
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:58,951
sleep with someone after
only an hour of talking to them.

154
00:16:58,953 --> 00:17:01,355
What sounds successful to you?

155
00:17:02,724 --> 00:17:06,792
I just wanna feel normal
and, like, I can talk to people.

156
00:17:06,794 --> 00:17:09,294
Do you feel
your lack of success

157
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:11,533
is due to your discomfort
around others?

158
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:14,101
Yes.

159
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:17,369
You are you.

160
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:20,138
I want you to focus on that.

161
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,173
You have to be
comfortable with yourself

162
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,109
before you can be
comfortable with others.

163
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:25,645
Dr. Corvath, we have to go soon.

164
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:29,180
Ugh. I'm so sorry.
I don't believe I got your name.

165
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:30,883
Uh, my name is Henry, sir.

166
00:17:30,885 --> 00:17:32,450
Ah, Henry.

167
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:35,655
Um, well,
you can call me Merrick.

168
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:37,188
It's a mouthful.

169
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,691
Anyway, I have to run.

170
00:17:38,693 --> 00:17:41,627
So if you're interested
in any further information

171
00:17:41,629 --> 00:17:42,797
about the program

172
00:17:43,932 --> 00:17:46,364
feel free to contact me.

173
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:49,301
Uh, there's a private
seminar soon.

174
00:17:49,303 --> 00:17:51,571
I mean,
this is just for information.

175
00:17:51,573 --> 00:17:55,710
So, if you're interested
in digging deeper, call me.

176
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:58,813
It was really nice meeting you.

177
00:18:13,995 --> 00:18:16,361
It is a total scam.

178
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:19,065
I don't know.
Maybe, but it might be worth it.

179
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:21,333
Yeah, try it out.

180
00:18:21,335 --> 00:18:23,669
You know, give them
your power of attorney and, uh,

181
00:18:23,671 --> 00:18:25,270
maybe, you know,
go out like Jonestown.

182
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:26,606
Seems like a good idea to me.

183
00:18:26,608 --> 00:18:28,106
Why are you jumping
into Jonestown?

184
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:31,978
It's just like
a... a self-help thing.

185
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,547
So was Jonestown.

186
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:38,183
They get you weak boys sucked in
and take you for all your worth.

187
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:39,819
- I'll be fine.
- But, you know,

188
00:18:39,821 --> 00:18:41,453
speaking of worth,
how much did you spend on that?

189
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:43,656
I'm not
comfortable telling you.

190
00:18:43,658 --> 00:18:45,925
That means you spent too much.

191
00:18:45,927 --> 00:18:47,325
That is unbelievable.

192
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:48,894
After everything
I've done for you, you know.

193
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:51,229
And I do it for free, right?

194
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:52,832
And here you are
going behind my back

195
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:54,000
giving some asshole money.

196
00:18:54,002 --> 00:18:55,968
What's his name again?

197
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,469
Corvath. Dr. Corvath.

198
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:58,771
Cor... Doctor Cor

199
00:18:58,773 --> 00:19:00,573
Dr. Corvath.
That's a made-up name.

200
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:03,475
- That name doesn't exist.
- I have his book.

201
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,377
I'm sorry, you gave him money,
you gave him more money

202
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:06,946
on top of the money
you already gave him?

203
00:19:06,948 --> 00:19:09,481
What the fuck, man?
This guy took money from you.

204
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,483
What did he...
What did he even tell you?

205
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:13,284
"If you believe in yourself,
it'll change"?

206
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:15,688
- It was very informative. Okay?
- Oh, I bet. Oh, I bet it was.

207
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,356
I mean, look at how much of
an effect it's had on your life.

208
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:20,693
Look at... You've changed
like that overnight.

209
00:19:20,695 --> 00:19:22,327
He made
a lot of really good points.

210
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,063
Oh, I bet he did.

211
00:19:24,065 --> 00:19:26,668
I bet he said everything that
you wanted to hear last night.

212
00:19:27,635 --> 00:19:29,001
Good God.

213
00:19:29,003 --> 00:19:33,306
You know, mark my words,
you are going to get screwed.

214
00:19:37,612 --> 00:19:39,879
So, um

215
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:41,781
you ready to do something
with your life tonight?

216
00:19:41,783 --> 00:19:43,483
Sounds
like an awful time.

217
00:19:44,652 --> 00:19:45,951
I'm sorry,

218
00:19:45,953 --> 00:19:48,890
speed dating sounds worse
than ritual suicide.

219
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:53,861
It's a bunch of losers there.

220
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:56,862
Bunch of losers?

221
00:19:56,864 --> 00:20:00,465
There's gonna be a bunch
of beautiful women that...

222
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:01,967
There's gonna be
a bunch of women there

223
00:20:01,969 --> 00:20:04,036
that, you know,
you might have a chance with.

224
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:06,371
So.

225
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:09,141
Listen bud, you are not
fucking an Adonis, okay?

226
00:20:09,143 --> 00:20:11,610
So, maybe you need to lower
your standards a little bit

227
00:20:11,612 --> 00:20:14,816
so that you can find
someone that's your speed,
right?

228
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,884
You gonna be there?

229
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:20,418
- Yeah, I'll be there.
- You know what?

230
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,456
I'm gonna pick you up
'cause I don't trust you.

231
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:24,222
All right.

232
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:25,591
I'm really not comfortable

233
00:20:25,593 --> 00:20:26,859
getting dropped
into this shit, dude.

234
00:20:26,861 --> 00:20:28,761
You have to take
a dive into the deep end

235
00:20:28,763 --> 00:20:30,096
- if you wanna learn how to
swim. - Dude, I hate swimming.

236
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:32,765
You have to learn
how to swim in order to thrive.

237
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:34,533
Look how much nicer
you look than me.

238
00:20:34,535 --> 00:20:36,269
It's because I try.

239
00:20:37,638 --> 00:20:39,872
Look.

240
00:20:39,874 --> 00:20:42,675
Stakes are low.
Just try to have some fun.

241
00:20:42,677 --> 00:20:44,710
All right? And you know what?

242
00:20:44,712 --> 00:20:47,880
If you fuck up, you can
always move on to the next girl.

243
00:21:02,163 --> 00:21:03,598
I'm Inez.

244
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:05,900
I'm Henry.

245
00:21:11,172 --> 00:21:12,507
Um...

246
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:19,947
One of us is gonna
have to talk eventually.

247
00:21:21,182 --> 00:21:23,448
Yeah. Um

248
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,886
I'm sorry.

249
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,187
Uh...

250
00:21:28,189 --> 00:21:30,488
Let's start nice and simple.

251
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,928
Um... what do you do?

252
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:36,998
I work...

253
00:21:39,267 --> 00:21:40,768
I... I work in an office.

254
00:21:48,075 --> 00:21:49,577
Uh, doing what?

255
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:56,282
Paperwork.

256
00:21:56,284 --> 00:21:58,920
Lots...
lots of paperwork.

257
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:05,224
That's, uh,
that sounds interesting.

258
00:22:05,226 --> 00:22:06,627
Um...

259
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:09,530
Do you like what you do?

260
00:22:14,202 --> 00:22:15,636
I guess so.

261
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:39,892
What the fuck, man?

262
00:22:39,894 --> 00:22:41,861
Why do you always
make me do shit like this?

263
00:22:41,863 --> 00:22:43,428
Because someone's
gotta get you laid.

264
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,897
That's pretty weird, dude.

265
00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:46,832
Look, I don't wanna
make you feel weird,

266
00:22:46,834 --> 00:22:48,567
or a piece of shit or anything.

267
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:50,703
But it's depressing
to watch you around women.

268
00:22:50,705 --> 00:22:52,403
Oh, well,
thank you for your concern.

269
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:54,840
No, seriously,
man. It's sad.

270
00:22:54,842 --> 00:22:57,209
Can't take it anymore,
watching you suffer.

271
00:22:57,211 --> 00:22:59,078
Why is this so important to you?

272
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,479
Maybe I see
a little bit of myself in you

273
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:02,882
- before I was cool.
- Oh, fuck you.

274
00:23:02,884 --> 00:23:05,751
Oh, oh, oh. Now I'm offended.

275
00:23:05,753 --> 00:23:08,053
After everything I did for you?

276
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:10,890
Also, your tally,
how many numbers?

277
00:23:10,892 --> 00:23:12,026
Zero.

278
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,631
Pathetic. Uh...

279
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:21,033
That's just pathetic, man.

280
00:23:21,035 --> 00:23:22,534
Yeah, well,
if you're such a magnet,

281
00:23:22,536 --> 00:23:24,303
- how many did you get?
- Four.

282
00:23:24,305 --> 00:23:25,640
Bullshit.

283
00:23:30,645 --> 00:23:31,977
That's your handwriting.

284
00:23:31,979 --> 00:23:33,612
You calling
me a liar, kiddo?

285
00:23:33,614 --> 00:23:35,281
Yes, I'm calling you a liar.
Show me the...

286
00:23:35,283 --> 00:23:36,982
No, no. You see with
your eyes, not with your hands.

287
00:23:36,984 --> 00:23:38,751
No need to shatter
your confidence anymore.

288
00:23:38,753 --> 00:23:41,419
Well, maybe I don't want
to meet people in bars.

289
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:42,988
You know, here's a question.

290
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:45,958
Uh, did you just spend the
whole time staring at the table?

291
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,626
I talked.

292
00:23:47,628 --> 00:23:49,995
"Hello" isn't talking.

293
00:23:49,997 --> 00:23:51,931
You actually
have to engage these women.

294
00:23:51,933 --> 00:23:52,998
Talk to them.

295
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,767
Not just
staring down at your hands,

296
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:57,036
- creeping them out.
- I'm not a creep.

297
00:23:58,372 --> 00:24:00,105
I'm not saying this to hurt you,

298
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:03,075
but you creep people out.

299
00:24:03,077 --> 00:24:04,843
I mean, I don't think
you're a creep personally,

300
00:24:04,845 --> 00:24:06,845
but other people
definitely think you're a creep.

301
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:08,981
See, this is exactly why
I don't like doing this shit.

302
00:24:08,983 --> 00:24:11,183
You always rag on me
and then I go home feeling

303
00:24:11,185 --> 00:24:13,519
like an even bigger piece
of shit than I did before.

304
00:24:13,521 --> 00:24:15,122
Would you stop
being a fucking baby?

305
00:24:16,757 --> 00:24:21,360
I, uh, I'm trying
to do this as a friend.

306
00:24:21,362 --> 00:24:25,130
And if you can't see that,
then I don't know what to say.

307
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:27,232
So stop acting
like this is hurting you.

308
00:24:27,234 --> 00:24:28,703
Lighten the fuck up.

309
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,846
To get into this thing, right?

310
00:24:40,848 --> 00:24:42,480
The least
he could do is fucking try.

311
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:45,150
But instead, he just sits
there staring at his fucking

312
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:47,086
little sausage fingers,
you know?

313
00:24:47,088 --> 00:24:50,222
"Oh, well,
I... I work at an organization

314
00:24:50,224 --> 00:24:51,757
and there's paper there

315
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:54,393
and I... I... I have a dick
that goes inwards."

316
00:24:54,395 --> 00:24:56,731
You know?

317
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:02,601
Oh, hey,
you didn't have to do that.

318
00:25:02,603 --> 00:25:04,870
Oh, it's no problem,
I'm just trying to be helpful.

319
00:25:04,872 --> 00:25:07,506
Well, thanks for that, Henry.

320
00:25:07,508 --> 00:25:08,741
How did you know my name?

321
00:25:08,743 --> 00:25:10,109
Your, uh...

322
00:25:10,111 --> 00:25:13,312
Oh, sorry,
I didn't realize I still had it.

323
00:25:13,314 --> 00:25:15,981
Rodian. Ritzy.

324
00:25:15,983 --> 00:25:19,518
Yeah, it's, um, it's nearby.

325
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,855
What is that?

326
00:25:21,522 --> 00:25:23,589
It's, uh,

327
00:25:23,591 --> 00:25:24,957
nothing fancy, it's just like

328
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:26,992
...pencil pushing.

329
00:25:26,994 --> 00:25:29,096
Gotta be
some good benefits though.

330
00:25:30,064 --> 00:25:32,364
Yeah. Not bad.

331
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:34,133
Pardon me, kiddo.

332
00:25:34,135 --> 00:25:35,834
Just thought
I'd bring the lady my mess.

333
00:25:37,104 --> 00:25:38,904
- Thank you for that.
- Sure.

334
00:25:38,906 --> 00:25:40,472
Yeah.

335
00:25:40,474 --> 00:25:42,241
So, uh,
I haven't seen you here before.

336
00:25:42,243 --> 00:25:43,709
I'm Greg.

337
00:25:43,711 --> 00:25:45,512
So what are... uh, you new here?

338
00:25:45,514 --> 00:25:47,815
I am.

339
00:26:48,075 --> 00:26:51,043
Henry, glad
you could come.

340
00:26:51,045 --> 00:26:52,978
I, um,
wasn't sure about this.

341
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,813
Yeah, no one ever is.

342
00:26:54,815 --> 00:26:56,181
Let's get you inside.

343
00:26:56,183 --> 00:26:58,085
I have a few people
I wanna introduce you to.

344
00:27:01,188 --> 00:27:02,387
Henry,

345
00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:05,092
I'd like you to meet
Greta and Sebastian.

346
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,127
Speak with Greta.

347
00:27:08,129 --> 00:27:09,962
I think you two
share similar circumstances.

348
00:27:09,964 --> 00:27:11,531
Isn't that right, Greta?

349
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:13,265
I believe so, Doctor.

350
00:27:13,267 --> 00:27:15,434
What are the circumstances?

351
00:27:15,436 --> 00:27:16,768
Your conditions.

352
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,705
I used to be
just like you, Henry.

353
00:27:19,707 --> 00:27:22,209
Never had a clue
what to say to anybody.

354
00:27:25,012 --> 00:27:27,514
Social repression, I should say.

355
00:27:27,516 --> 00:27:29,348
Look at her.

356
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,482
Bell of the ball.

357
00:27:30,484 --> 00:27:31,884
How did you get over it?

358
00:27:31,886 --> 00:27:34,686
Oh, treatments, of course.

359
00:27:34,688 --> 00:27:36,655
This looks like a party.

360
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:38,790
Well, a little fun.

361
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:40,292
Little treatment.

362
00:27:40,294 --> 00:27:41,994
What's the harm in that, huh?

363
00:27:41,996 --> 00:27:43,729
Listen, I have to leave you
for a moment.

364
00:27:43,731 --> 00:27:45,297
Don't be nervous.

365
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:46,734
You're in good hands here.

366
00:27:48,537 --> 00:27:50,503
Can I get you a drink, Henry?

367
00:27:50,505 --> 00:27:53,405
Uh, what do you...

368
00:27:53,407 --> 00:27:54,473
What do you have?

369
00:27:54,475 --> 00:27:56,975
Well, we have punch and

370
00:27:56,977 --> 00:27:58,677
well, punch.

371
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,879
Not many options, I'm afraid.

372
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:02,216
Oh, okay.

373
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,783
Um, Henry,

374
00:28:04,785 --> 00:28:08,453
there's somebody
you absolutely have to meet.

375
00:28:08,455 --> 00:28:10,789
All right? Come with me.

376
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:12,259
Behave yourself, Henry.

377
00:28:13,494 --> 00:28:15,394
Right this way.

378
00:28:15,396 --> 00:28:17,763
Henry, this is Alexander.

379
00:28:17,765 --> 00:28:21,068
Perhaps the most
interesting person in here.

380
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:25,737
You give me far too much credit.

381
00:28:27,942 --> 00:28:30,175
Henry, you say?

382
00:28:30,177 --> 00:28:32,444
You can't be serious.

383
00:28:32,446 --> 00:28:35,749
All these people here
and you're reading a book.

384
00:28:38,786 --> 00:28:40,520
Paintings, dear girl,

385
00:28:40,522 --> 00:28:42,056
are far more important to me.

386
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,425
Let me ask you

387
00:28:45,627 --> 00:28:47,161
what does it say to you?

388
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:51,664
This seems to me
like a representation of a form.

389
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:53,932
That's all.

390
00:28:53,934 --> 00:28:55,334
No, I don't believe what he,
the artist meant.

391
00:28:55,336 --> 00:28:58,103
Are you trying to say
that it's meant to be more

392
00:28:58,105 --> 00:28:59,974
than representation
of human form?

393
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:06,845
Look at how bodies,
um, divided by sections.

394
00:29:06,847 --> 00:29:09,348
Look at how limbs are placed.

395
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,849
Nobody moves like that.

396
00:29:10,851 --> 00:29:12,884
This is just
to display movement.

397
00:29:12,886 --> 00:29:15,854
It's very hard to show
three-dimensional movement

398
00:29:15,856 --> 00:29:17,055
on the two-dimensional space.

399
00:29:17,057 --> 00:29:18,625
Or perhaps what
he's saying

400
00:29:18,627 --> 00:29:21,393
is that human forms
can be distorted and improved.

401
00:29:43,752 --> 00:29:45,585
Well, this is going nowhere.

402
00:29:45,587 --> 00:29:48,887
Let's ask our new friend
what he thinks on the subject.

403
00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:50,958
Henry, what do you think?

404
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,858
Hello.

405
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,228
Uh.

406
00:29:55,296 --> 00:29:56,696
What?

407
00:29:56,698 --> 00:29:58,997
Well, do you feel that
the meaning behind the artwork

408
00:29:58,999 --> 00:30:00,799
belongs expressly to the artist?

409
00:30:00,801 --> 00:30:02,301
Or do you feel
that it goes beyond

410
00:30:02,303 --> 00:30:06,338
the artist's intentions
and expressive subjective?

411
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,909
Rather simplistic,
wouldn't you say?

412
00:30:09,711 --> 00:30:11,310
But yes,

413
00:30:11,312 --> 00:30:13,147
how do you feel on the subject?

414
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,285
I don't know.

415
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,987
Well, I guess
this is the best answer

416
00:30:21,989 --> 00:30:24,657
any of us could have hoped for.

417
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:26,759
Attention, everyone.

418
00:30:26,761 --> 00:30:29,094
If you could all please join me
in the next room.

419
00:30:29,096 --> 00:30:31,498
Dr. Corvath is ready to begin.

420
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,035
Are you joining
us tonight?

421
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,302
I have had enough

422
00:30:37,304 --> 00:30:40,172
of Merrick's sermons
for one evening, I'm afraid.

423
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:42,508
Suit yourself.

424
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,844
Henry.

425
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:53,452
Henry.

426
00:31:06,735 --> 00:31:08,168
Good luck to you.

427
00:31:14,475 --> 00:31:16,043
Good luck to you.

428
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:53,679
Well, now that we're all
settled in

429
00:31:53,681 --> 00:31:55,182
we can begin the session.

430
00:31:56,283 --> 00:31:57,717
Jensen.

431
00:32:35,355 --> 00:32:36,990
Something matter, Henry?

432
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:40,027
What is this stuff?

433
00:32:41,896 --> 00:32:44,831
I'm not gonna lie to you,
it's not exactly tasty.

434
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:48,033
This next phase is more advanced

435
00:32:48,035 --> 00:32:49,735
than what's in the brochure,

436
00:32:49,737 --> 00:32:52,172
but it's totally on the level.

437
00:32:53,908 --> 00:32:55,476
It's perfectly safe.

438
00:32:59,112 --> 00:33:01,014
You are among friends here,
Henry.

439
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:09,223
Is this...

440
00:33:10,758 --> 00:33:12,424
Are we doing drugs?

441
00:33:13,695 --> 00:33:17,262
We're just gonna talk
a little bit, and, uh

442
00:33:17,264 --> 00:33:19,500
scrutinize in a friendly way.

443
00:33:41,054 --> 00:33:42,422
Well, then

444
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:46,326
if you don't mind, Henry

445
00:33:47,327 --> 00:33:48,663
why are you here?

446
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,799
I just

447
00:33:53,801 --> 00:33:57,170
wish I could talk
to people better.

448
00:33:58,573 --> 00:33:59,839
No, no.

449
00:33:59,841 --> 00:34:01,509
Why are you here?

450
00:34:03,578 --> 00:34:05,713
I feel like
I'm too shy, I guess.

451
00:34:07,015 --> 00:34:10,482
That's no reason, Henry.

452
00:34:10,484 --> 00:34:12,319
Shyness is a symptom.

453
00:34:14,022 --> 00:34:16,056
Why are you here?

454
00:34:18,693 --> 00:34:20,158
I don't understand.

455
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,596
Yes, you do.

456
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,468
I don't like myself very much.

457
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,471
And why not?

458
00:34:33,206 --> 00:34:34,676
I don't know.

459
00:34:39,581 --> 00:34:42,115
Because you've been taught
self-hate.

460
00:34:43,483 --> 00:34:45,419
There's no
reason for this.

461
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:48,119
You wanna be open.

462
00:34:48,121 --> 00:34:49,489
You wanna be free.

463
00:34:50,692 --> 00:34:53,759
You can't. Why?

464
00:34:53,761 --> 00:34:56,161
Because you've had
these restrictions

465
00:34:56,163 --> 00:34:58,566
placed on you your entire life.

466
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,233
How do you break free

467
00:35:02,235 --> 00:35:04,404
from this prison of the mind?

468
00:35:07,508 --> 00:35:11,879
You cannot remove
those shackles by yourselves.

469
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,781
That, which is ingrained

470
00:35:15,783 --> 00:35:17,083
must be undone

471
00:35:17,085 --> 00:35:21,587
by eliminating
parts of yourself.

472
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:23,457
What's happening to me?

473
00:35:26,293 --> 00:35:28,563
Something necessary.

474
00:35:31,365 --> 00:35:33,966
Jensen, Sebastian.

475
00:37:09,731 --> 00:37:11,262
No!

476
00:37:11,264 --> 00:37:12,600
No!

477
00:37:13,634 --> 00:37:14,834
No!

478
00:37:14,836 --> 00:37:17,203
Don't! Don't!

479
00:37:17,205 --> 00:37:18,537
I won't tell anyone.

480
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:20,039
You're so lucky, Henry,

481
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:23,243
to live the rest of your
life without a consciousness.

482
00:37:24,178 --> 00:37:25,544
I envy you.

483
00:37:25,546 --> 00:37:28,047
No, no, no!

484
00:37:28,049 --> 00:37:31,249
No, no, no, no!

485
00:37:38,793 --> 00:37:39,992
Hello.

486
00:37:39,994 --> 00:37:42,228
I'm Dr. Merrick Corvath.

487
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,495
And today,

488
00:37:43,497 --> 00:37:45,965
you will begin your ascent

489
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:49,869
to purity and positivity.

490
00:37:49,871 --> 00:37:52,874
I ask you to think about
what brought you here today.

491
00:37:54,307 --> 00:37:56,043
Now, let's
reflect on that.

492
00:37:57,078 --> 00:37:58,611
Now.

493
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:12,091
Oh, God! Oh, God!

494
00:38:12,093 --> 00:38:13,493
Oh, God.

495
00:41:45,906 --> 00:41:47,806
<i>The mind plays tricks.</i>

496
00:41:47,808 --> 00:41:51,012
<i>It's not always wise</i>
<i>to trust it.</i>

497
00:41:52,713 --> 00:41:54,582
What the fuck did you do to me?

498
00:43:16,297 --> 00:43:17,665
Come with me.

499
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:24,136
Where the hell have you
been? You've been out for days.

500
00:43:24,138 --> 00:43:26,338
I couldn't even
get a hold of you.

501
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,706
I went to that meeting.

502
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:29,276
You... you...

503
00:43:30,678 --> 00:43:32,746
Well, what happened?

504
00:43:34,415 --> 00:43:35,548
I don't remember.

505
00:43:36,951 --> 00:43:38,350
They...

506
00:43:38,352 --> 00:43:40,018
They gave me something to drink

507
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,354
and the rest of it
is just kinda blurry and...

508
00:43:42,356 --> 00:43:44,323
Oh, man. What...

509
00:43:44,325 --> 00:43:46,425
What the fuck
did I say to you, huh?

510
00:43:46,427 --> 00:43:48,627
How many times did I tell you
that was a bad idea?

511
00:43:48,629 --> 00:43:50,496
- I know.
- Yeah.

512
00:43:50,498 --> 00:43:51,832
Yeah. You know now.

513
00:43:55,803 --> 00:43:58,804
Did they...
Did they take anything from you?

514
00:43:58,806 --> 00:44:00,272
Did they do anything to you?

515
00:44:00,274 --> 00:44:02,877
I... I...

516
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:06,347
Uh, I don't think so.

517
00:44:10,484 --> 00:44:12,253
You need to grow the fuck up.

518
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:45,177
That book sucks.

519
00:45:45,179 --> 00:45:47,813
Mm? No, I'm not even
really reading it.

520
00:45:47,815 --> 00:45:50,148
Good 'cause it sucks.

521
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:52,084
Can I get you
anything else, Henry?

522
00:45:52,086 --> 00:45:54,019
Is there anything in that pile
you would recommend?

523
00:45:54,021 --> 00:45:56,221
Hm.

524
00:45:56,223 --> 00:45:57,756
A couple of the horror ones
are pretty good,

525
00:45:57,758 --> 00:46:00,993
but most of it is just

526
00:46:00,995 --> 00:46:03,395
trashy romance
and brodown bullshit.

527
00:46:03,397 --> 00:46:05,264
So, it's kind of
whatever you're into.

528
00:46:05,266 --> 00:46:07,533
Is it bad that the only
one really jumping out at me

529
00:46:07,535 --> 00:46:09,134
looks like a trashy romance?

530
00:46:09,136 --> 00:46:10,670
As long as
you don't pick Devoy,

531
00:46:10,672 --> 00:46:12,904
- you're all right in my
book. - Never even heard of him.

532
00:46:12,906 --> 00:46:14,406
Not much of a reader?

533
00:46:14,408 --> 00:46:17,943
I can't read or write.

534
00:46:17,945 --> 00:46:19,411
Oh shit, are you serious?

535
00:46:19,413 --> 00:46:21,581
- No, no.
- Oh, thank God!

536
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:24,316
My boss is always chewing
me out over how I talk to
people.

537
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:26,418
So, uh, yeah.

538
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,819
I'm gonna get back to work

539
00:46:27,821 --> 00:46:30,723
before this turns
into a complete disaster.

540
00:46:41,468 --> 00:46:43,268
Hey, so I know that
we really don't know each other

541
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:44,803
and that
this really is kinda awkward

542
00:46:44,805 --> 00:46:46,171
and I'm sorry
for making it awkward.

543
00:46:46,173 --> 00:46:48,073
And this, obviously,
isn't a place to do this,

544
00:46:48,075 --> 00:46:50,010
but would you maybe possibly
wanna go out sometime?

545
00:46:51,746 --> 00:46:53,280
Just dinner?

546
00:46:53,881 --> 00:46:55,215
Yeah.

547
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:57,517
All... all right.

548
00:46:57,519 --> 00:46:59,552
- Wait, really?
- Yeah.

549
00:46:59,554 --> 00:47:01,021
Oh, uh, cool.

550
00:47:02,122 --> 00:47:04,825
- Cool.
- Uh, Hank.

551
00:47:05,893 --> 00:47:08,162
You, uh, might want this.

552
00:47:10,598 --> 00:47:12,532
Oh, huh.

553
00:47:12,534 --> 00:47:13,865
Uh, yes, thank you.

554
00:47:13,867 --> 00:47:15,768
Um

555
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:17,404
I am going to call you

556
00:47:18,305 --> 00:47:19,440
at this number.

557
00:47:23,077 --> 00:47:25,377
Are you coming out
tonight or what?

558
00:47:25,379 --> 00:47:26,746
I can't.

559
00:47:26,748 --> 00:47:28,514
<i>- Why not?</i>
- I have a date tonight.

560
00:47:28,516 --> 00:47:30,115
<i>Bullshit!</i>

561
00:47:30,117 --> 00:47:33,285
I do. With a real-life
flesh and blood human being.

562
00:47:33,287 --> 00:47:35,487
<i>Oh, is she from</i>
<i>out of town?</i>

563
00:47:35,489 --> 00:47:38,090
<i>You know, this is a</i>
<i>sorry excuse even for you,</i>
<i>pal.</i>

564
00:47:38,092 --> 00:47:40,225
I thought you'd be happy for me.

565
00:47:40,227 --> 00:47:41,794
<i>You want a</i>
<i>fucking lollipop?</i>

566
00:47:41,796 --> 00:47:43,629
<i>I... You know, I'm just</i>
<i>finding it hard to believe</i>

567
00:47:43,631 --> 00:47:45,531
<i>that you managed to get</i>
<i>a date out of someone by...</i>

568
00:47:45,533 --> 00:47:48,200
By asking them out? Yeah.

569
00:47:48,202 --> 00:47:51,136
<i>Hm. Well,</i>
<i>that's a real fucking shame.</i>

570
00:47:51,138 --> 00:47:52,871
<i>I guess this is</i>
<i>it then, yeah?</i>

571
00:47:52,873 --> 00:47:55,440
<i>You finally decided</i>
<i>to stop being a pussy?</i>

572
00:47:55,442 --> 00:47:57,442
You know, it's really
difficult to figure out if
you're,

573
00:47:57,444 --> 00:48:01,248
you know,
joking around sometimes or not.

574
00:48:07,454 --> 00:48:09,589
If you could
commit any crime

575
00:48:09,591 --> 00:48:11,223
and get away with it,

576
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:12,759
what would it be?

577
00:48:12,761 --> 00:48:14,827
Geez,
right into the deep end, huh?

578
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:16,196
Um.

579
00:48:17,665 --> 00:48:18,964
I don't know,
you go first.

580
00:48:18,966 --> 00:48:21,032
I need a minute
to think about it.

581
00:48:21,034 --> 00:48:23,301
Art or jewel thief.

582
00:48:23,303 --> 00:48:26,271
Crawling under lasers,

583
00:48:26,273 --> 00:48:28,473
sneak around, steal shit.

584
00:48:28,475 --> 00:48:30,710
Like, anybody
can murder somebody.

585
00:48:30,712 --> 00:48:34,246
But how many people
can steal the  <i>Mona Lisa?</i>

586
00:48:34,248 --> 00:48:35,748
Plus, you're not harming anyone.

587
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:38,553
Well, except for some rich
douchebag's wallet.

588
00:48:39,587 --> 00:48:41,987
So, how about you?

589
00:48:41,989 --> 00:48:44,824
All right, uh, if I had a crime,

590
00:48:44,826 --> 00:48:47,325
it'd probably be something
like embezzlement

591
00:48:47,327 --> 00:48:49,194
or something financial
like that.

592
00:48:49,196 --> 00:48:50,897
Boring.

593
00:48:50,899 --> 00:48:52,130
Hear me out.

594
00:48:52,132 --> 00:48:53,633
You do all the
boring stuff

595
00:48:53,635 --> 00:48:55,902
and then you have money
to do all the fun stuff.

596
00:48:55,904 --> 00:48:57,637
So, what's the fun stuff?

597
00:48:57,639 --> 00:49:00,840
Buy a huge mansion
and fill it with tigers.

598
00:49:00,842 --> 00:49:03,041
I can get behind that.

599
00:49:03,043 --> 00:49:04,911
So, what do you do
at work anyway?

600
00:49:04,913 --> 00:49:07,014
You said pencil pushing.

601
00:49:07,916 --> 00:49:10,618
I, um...

602
00:49:11,952 --> 00:49:14,453
I... I don't really know
what I do there.

603
00:49:14,455 --> 00:49:16,856
And... and like,

604
00:49:16,858 --> 00:49:19,725
the funny thing is,
I'm not even kidding.

605
00:49:19,727 --> 00:49:22,062
Ever thought of doing
anything else?

606
00:49:23,263 --> 00:49:25,030
I don't know, it...

607
00:49:25,032 --> 00:49:26,465
It pays all right.

608
00:49:26,467 --> 00:49:28,168
And, like.

609
00:49:29,136 --> 00:49:30,570
I'm not happy with it,

610
00:49:30,572 --> 00:49:32,437
but I'm not really
unhappy with it either.

611
00:49:32,439 --> 00:49:35,474
Kinda settled. I... I get that.

612
00:49:35,476 --> 00:49:37,976
Are you happy where you are?

613
00:49:37,978 --> 00:49:39,579
Uh, I usually tell people

614
00:49:39,581 --> 00:49:42,280
that I'm suing the government
over bad meat

615
00:49:42,282 --> 00:49:43,616
and sort of leave it at that.

616
00:49:43,618 --> 00:49:45,618
Well, that's one way
to avoid it.

617
00:49:48,455 --> 00:49:50,155
So,

618
00:49:50,157 --> 00:49:52,525
you wanna do something fun

619
00:49:52,527 --> 00:49:55,763
and maybe a little bit stupid?

620
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:58,196
Like, what?

621
00:52:01,188 --> 00:52:03,990
Oh, uh, sorry you had to
see all that back there.

622
00:52:03,992 --> 00:52:07,292
It's not
the worst thing I've ever seen.

623
00:52:07,294 --> 00:52:08,661
Well, I'm glad to know

624
00:52:08,663 --> 00:52:09,996
I didn't make
the bottom of the list.

625
00:52:11,198 --> 00:52:13,198
Uh,

626
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,235
- so, um...
- So?

627
00:52:17,237 --> 00:52:19,907
Would you maybe
wanna do this again?

628
00:52:21,709 --> 00:52:24,309
I guess I could use
another free meal sometime.

629
00:52:28,082 --> 00:52:29,550
I had a good time tonight.

630
00:52:30,051 --> 00:52:31,385
Me too.

631
00:52:38,358 --> 00:52:40,394
- Good night, Henry.
- Goodnight.

632
00:54:40,648 --> 00:54:42,948
So here's a question.

633
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:46,451
If you could have sex
with anyone in history,

634
00:54:46,453 --> 00:54:48,087
who would it be?

635
00:54:48,089 --> 00:54:49,955
Oh, God, I don't know.

636
00:54:49,957 --> 00:54:51,391
Um.

637
00:54:53,094 --> 00:54:55,127
How about

638
00:54:55,129 --> 00:54:57,732
go with, um

639
00:54:59,867 --> 00:55:01,066
Joan of Arc?

640
00:55:01,068 --> 00:55:03,905
You're a sick fucking ticket.

641
00:55:05,139 --> 00:55:07,708
Your face.

642
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:16,215
How come we never talk
about anything real?

643
00:55:16,217 --> 00:55:18,984
What's real?

644
00:55:18,986 --> 00:55:20,318
I don't know.

645
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,687
I just feel
like every time we talk

646
00:55:21,689 --> 00:55:23,656
it goes to some random subject

647
00:55:23,658 --> 00:55:25,291
and suddenly I'm being judged

648
00:55:25,293 --> 00:55:27,226
for wanting to plow
Jeanne d'Arc.

649
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:32,533
Well, I don't know, I.

650
00:55:34,334 --> 00:55:37,772
I never really thought
I was avoiding anything, but

651
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,573
to answer your question...

652
00:55:40,575 --> 00:55:42,610
- Finally.
- Shut it.

653
00:55:43,778 --> 00:55:44,710
I just

654
00:55:44,712 --> 00:55:46,111
I don't know.

655
00:55:46,113 --> 00:55:47,613
I just feel
like there's nothing really

656
00:55:47,615 --> 00:55:49,014
to talk about
when it comes to me.

657
00:55:49,016 --> 00:55:51,217
I mean, I'm broke,

658
00:55:51,219 --> 00:55:53,118
I work at a coffee shop.

659
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,720
That's about it.

660
00:55:54,722 --> 00:55:56,991
What are your hopes and dreams?

661
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,492
It's too early
for this conversation.

662
00:56:01,494 --> 00:56:03,095
You're avoiding again.

663
00:56:03,097 --> 00:56:05,831
All right, if you want
something a little more

664
00:56:05,833 --> 00:56:07,101
tangible.

665
00:56:10,571 --> 00:56:12,840
Whoa. Physical media.

666
00:56:14,441 --> 00:56:15,741
What is it?

667
00:56:15,743 --> 00:56:17,578
Well, let's open it.

668
00:56:22,316 --> 00:56:24,717
Did you make me a mixtape?

669
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:27,152
Don't say I never
did nothing for you.

670
00:56:27,154 --> 00:56:28,488
- Wow.
- Come on.

671
00:56:35,563 --> 00:56:37,930
- Oh, no.
- Yep.

672
00:56:37,932 --> 00:56:40,465
You're never gonna let me
live that down, are you?

673
00:56:40,467 --> 00:56:42,433
It was pretty tragic,

674
00:56:42,435 --> 00:56:44,404
but cute.

675
00:56:49,442 --> 00:56:51,746
It's too weird, right?
Do you hate it?

676
00:56:56,584 --> 00:56:57,952
I love it.

677
00:57:09,563 --> 00:57:10,663
Thank you.

678
00:57:38,926 --> 00:57:41,560
Like, he's a fucking waste,
you know?

679
00:57:41,562 --> 00:57:43,130
I mean, Jesus.

680
00:57:47,935 --> 00:57:49,601
I know...
I know he creeps you out,

681
00:57:49,603 --> 00:57:50,936
but you got nothing
to worry about, all right?

682
00:57:50,938 --> 00:57:53,005
I mean, he's a fucking pussy.

683
00:57:53,007 --> 00:57:54,540
What was that?

684
00:57:54,542 --> 00:57:57,109
- What was what?
- What'd you just say?

685
00:57:57,111 --> 00:57:59,812
- I was just clearing my throat.
- No, you weren't.

686
00:57:59,814 --> 00:58:01,647
What did you say?

687
00:58:01,649 --> 00:58:03,315
What the hell's going on, man?

688
00:58:03,317 --> 00:58:05,884
I'm just curious, you know,
if you called me a pussy or not?

689
00:58:05,886 --> 00:58:08,320
Uh, I didn't call you anything.

690
00:58:08,322 --> 00:58:10,522
But if I did call you something,
it was a joke.

691
00:58:10,524 --> 00:58:12,725
- So, relax.
- Oh, huh.

692
00:58:12,727 --> 00:58:15,260
I'm not laughing, man.

693
00:58:15,262 --> 00:58:18,130
Okay, um, I'm sorry
you can't take a joke, I guess.

694
00:58:26,407 --> 00:58:28,474
Uh, look, dude, you're

695
00:58:28,476 --> 00:58:29,875
creeping everybody out.

696
00:58:29,877 --> 00:58:31,477
So why don't...
Why don't you just knock it off?

697
00:58:31,479 --> 00:58:32,811
- All right?
- Oh. Oh.

698
00:58:32,813 --> 00:58:34,880
I got a question for you.

699
00:58:34,882 --> 00:58:36,648
Back when you used to
take me out places,

700
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:38,417
were you doing it
just to have a laugh?

701
00:58:38,419 --> 00:58:39,585
Where's this coming from?

702
00:58:39,587 --> 00:58:41,553
It's a simple question, man.

703
00:58:41,555 --> 00:58:42,988
Were you doing it
for my benefit,

704
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:46,125
or were you just trying
to make fun of me?

705
00:58:46,127 --> 00:58:48,394
Look, dude, I, uh

706
00:58:48,396 --> 00:58:49,795
can tell you're pretty upset,

707
00:58:49,797 --> 00:58:51,296
but, uh, it's got
nothing to do with me.

708
00:58:51,298 --> 00:58:53,365
So why don't you go
back to your desk

709
00:58:53,367 --> 00:58:57,436
and reflect on why no one
can stand to be around you,

710
00:58:57,438 --> 00:58:58,771
and maybe you'll
figure out

711
00:58:58,773 --> 00:59:00,439
that it has nothing
to do with me

712
00:59:00,441 --> 00:59:02,509
and everything to do with you.

713
00:59:02,511 --> 00:59:03,642
Take it easy, Henry.

714
00:59:03,644 --> 00:59:04,943
- Shut up!
- Whoa!

715
00:59:04,945 --> 00:59:06,245
Hey, man, that's unhinged.
All right?

716
00:59:06,247 --> 00:59:07,579
You thought
you can come in here,

717
00:59:07,581 --> 00:59:09,248
getting up in my face,

718
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:11,050
telling me that I'm saying shit
about you behind your back?

719
00:59:11,052 --> 00:59:12,551
All right?

720
00:59:12,553 --> 00:59:15,220
Now you're flexing on me after
all the good I did for you?

721
00:59:15,222 --> 00:59:17,356
It's fucked up, man.

722
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:20,225
You are way more of a
freak than I thought you were.

723
00:59:25,066 --> 00:59:27,499
Fuck off, man.
Leave me the fuck alone.

724
01:02:05,292 --> 01:02:06,959
Fuck you!

725
01:02:06,961 --> 01:02:10,395
Fuck you! Fuck you!

726
01:02:10,397 --> 01:02:12,967
Fuck you!

727
01:02:19,473 --> 01:02:22,741
Henry, please.
I am your friend.

728
01:02:22,743 --> 01:02:24,876
Really? You're my friend?

729
01:02:24,878 --> 01:02:26,878
Fuck you, you're
my friend.

730
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,380
Henry, please. Please.

731
01:02:28,382 --> 01:02:30,782
"Please, please.
I'm your friend."

732
01:02:30,784 --> 01:02:32,818
Fuck you, you're
my friend.

733
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:35,887
I hate you! Fuck you!

734
01:02:44,733 --> 01:02:47,366
Oh, look at him.

735
01:02:47,368 --> 01:02:50,170
Look at the little bitch.

736
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,508
This is from you, idiot.

737
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:56,775
Fuck you!

738
01:03:00,381 --> 01:03:01,549
I love you.

739
01:03:02,416 --> 01:03:03,815
You're my brother.

740
01:03:03,817 --> 01:03:06,218
Please,
please, just leave me be.

741
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:08,222
- Oh.
- Please.

742
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:11,225
Oh. Oh.

743
01:03:12,226 --> 01:03:14,893
Henry, it's okay. It's okay.

744
01:03:14,895 --> 01:03:16,562
Please, just take me
to the hospital.

745
01:03:16,564 --> 01:03:18,397
Henry, please. It's okay.

746
01:03:18,399 --> 01:03:20,432
It's okay. I'm...

747
01:03:20,434 --> 01:03:23,503
No, no, no, no, no, no.

748
01:03:23,505 --> 01:03:25,540
No.

749
01:03:31,312 --> 01:03:33,013
Don't...

750
01:04:31,905 --> 01:04:33,374
Sloppy work.

751
01:04:39,279 --> 01:04:41,583
Something about this
feel familiar to you?

752
01:04:42,983 --> 01:04:44,751
B&E?

753
01:04:44,753 --> 01:04:47,252
Blunt force trauma.

754
01:04:47,254 --> 01:04:49,988
The guy here probably
spotted a prowler and

755
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:51,358
things ended badly.

756
01:04:52,393 --> 01:04:53,661
I don't know, it

757
01:04:55,062 --> 01:04:56,497
just doesn't feel right.

758
01:04:58,298 --> 01:05:00,867
Well, while you wrestle
with your feelings,

759
01:05:00,869 --> 01:05:02,503
I'm gonna go
wait for the results.

760
01:05:06,608 --> 01:05:07,774
I gotta make a call.

761
01:05:18,686 --> 01:05:20,620
Hey, it's me.

762
01:05:20,622 --> 01:05:23,323
Yeah, I'm sorry
I had to leave early.

763
01:05:26,528 --> 01:05:28,328
I said I'm sorry.

764
01:05:31,566 --> 01:05:32,933
Honey?

765
01:05:49,751 --> 01:05:51,751
Hi.

766
01:05:51,753 --> 01:05:53,985
I just want to tell you

767
01:05:53,987 --> 01:05:56,421
how much you mean to me.

768
01:05:56,423 --> 01:05:59,090
I've never met anyone
who I've cared for

769
01:05:59,092 --> 01:06:00,461
like I care for you.

770
01:06:02,564 --> 01:06:06,333
And I think what we have
is very special.

771
01:06:10,505 --> 01:06:13,340
I want you to know
how much you mean to me.

772
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:18,513
You bring out the best in me.

773
01:06:25,352 --> 01:06:27,488
And I...

774
01:06:29,056 --> 01:06:30,390
And I...

775
01:06:34,796 --> 01:06:36,729
Hi.

776
01:06:36,731 --> 01:06:38,533
I just wanna tell you.

777
01:06:40,902 --> 01:06:42,436
I'm really happy

778
01:06:43,136 --> 01:06:44,504
that we met.

779
01:06:44,506 --> 01:06:45,740
Being with you

780
01:06:47,942 --> 01:06:51,278
has made me realize

781
01:06:52,547 --> 01:06:53,748
that I can

782
01:06:54,949 --> 01:06:56,383
talk to people.

783
01:06:59,587 --> 01:07:00,755
And I...

784
01:07:03,558 --> 01:07:04,726
And...

785
01:07:05,994 --> 01:07:07,927
I

786
01:07:07,929 --> 01:07:10,596
I lo

787
01:07:10,598 --> 01:07:11,799
I I

788
01:07:12,534 --> 01:07:13,599
I love...

789
01:08:10,725 --> 01:08:12,024
I'm sorry I'm late.

790
01:08:12,026 --> 01:08:14,292
It's been a while, Hank.

791
01:08:14,294 --> 01:08:17,128
Life has been crazy.

792
01:08:21,335 --> 01:08:23,970
At first, I thought
that I had done something,

793
01:08:23,972 --> 01:08:26,239
but then I saw the news.

794
01:08:26,975 --> 01:08:28,808
How are you doing?

795
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:30,143
What news?

796
01:08:30,845 --> 01:08:31,978
Your coworker.

797
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:35,313
That Greg guy, he was murdered.

798
01:08:35,315 --> 01:08:37,650
Right. That, yeah.

799
01:08:37,652 --> 01:08:39,852
That's been tough.

800
01:08:41,923 --> 01:08:43,188
Yeah. Are you okay?

801
01:08:43,190 --> 01:08:45,558
Shocking how
someone's life

802
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,629
can just be taken away
like that.

803
01:08:48,462 --> 01:08:52,031
Waiter!

804
01:08:52,033 --> 01:08:53,433
I'm starving.

805
01:08:54,134 --> 01:08:55,703
So you're okay.

806
01:08:56,938 --> 01:09:00,039
I've never felt better

807
01:09:00,041 --> 01:09:01,743
in my entire life.

808
01:09:03,511 --> 01:09:05,711
Now, where is
the goddamn waiter?

809
01:09:09,617 --> 01:09:12,518
Sir, I'm gonna have to
ask you to lower your voice.

810
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,823
I want a steak. Rare.

811
01:09:16,824 --> 01:09:18,189
Do you want champagne?

812
01:09:18,191 --> 01:09:19,992
I want champagne.
I'm in a champagne mood.

813
01:09:19,994 --> 01:09:22,429
We'll have two glasses
of champagne, please.

814
01:09:28,002 --> 01:09:29,300
What's this?

815
01:09:29,302 --> 01:09:30,736
What's going
on over there?

816
01:09:30,738 --> 01:09:33,371
Something interesting?
I'm over here.

817
01:09:33,373 --> 01:09:35,173
Henry, you're...
You're coughing a lot.

818
01:09:35,175 --> 01:09:36,509
Do you wanna
do this another night?

819
01:09:36,511 --> 01:09:40,112
I feel great.

820
01:09:40,114 --> 01:09:42,048
I'm just
a little under the weather.

821
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:43,450
I'm fine.

822
01:09:45,787 --> 01:09:47,855
We need to get you
to a hospital.

823
01:09:48,856 --> 01:09:50,255
Why?

824
01:09:50,257 --> 01:09:51,926
Because there's blood
coming out of your mouth.

825
01:09:52,927 --> 01:09:54,527
What the fuck is this?

826
01:09:54,529 --> 01:09:55,961
You invite me here

827
01:09:55,963 --> 01:09:57,730
and then you tell me
that I look like shit?

828
01:09:57,732 --> 01:10:00,365
- No, that's not what this
is. - Is this a fucking ambush?

829
01:10:00,367 --> 01:10:02,968
Making an eye
to that fucking guy over there,

830
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:05,071
telling me I look like shit.

831
01:10:05,073 --> 01:10:07,773
You're just trying to dump me
in the most brutal way possible?

832
01:10:07,775 --> 01:10:10,543
For fuck's sake,
that's not what's going on.

833
01:10:10,545 --> 01:10:12,310
I haven't seen you in weeks.

834
01:10:12,312 --> 01:10:13,846
And you come here
and you're coughing

835
01:10:13,848 --> 01:10:15,581
and blood comes
out of your mouth.

836
01:10:15,583 --> 01:10:17,717
- I'm concerned. Okay?
- Why do I feel this way?

837
01:10:17,719 --> 01:10:19,819
I didn't feel like this
before I got here.

838
01:10:23,191 --> 01:10:26,859
God, you look
so fucking good tonight.

839
01:10:26,861 --> 01:10:30,428
Don't... don't grab me
like that. I don't like it!

840
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:32,363
It's a compliment. Fuck!

841
01:10:32,365 --> 01:10:34,133
Henry, please let me
take you to the hospital.

842
01:10:34,135 --> 01:10:36,501
I'm gonna need you both
to get the hell out of here.

843
01:10:36,503 --> 01:10:37,972
Fuck you!

844
01:10:39,339 --> 01:10:40,840
We need
to get you an ambulance.

845
01:10:40,842 --> 01:10:42,007
Fuck you!

846
01:10:42,009 --> 01:10:43,441
- I'm trying to get you...
- Fuck you!

847
01:10:43,443 --> 01:10:47,347
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

848
01:10:48,216 --> 01:10:49,550
Fuck you!

849
01:10:50,685 --> 01:10:51,853
Fuck you!

850
01:11:33,426 --> 01:11:36,095
Let me in!

851
01:11:36,097 --> 01:11:38,664
Open the fucking door!

852
01:11:38,666 --> 01:11:40,398
You need help, Henry.

853
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,970
Let me in now!

854
01:11:43,938 --> 01:11:47,106
Oh, open the fucking door!

855
01:11:47,108 --> 01:11:50,543
Oh, just let me in.

856
01:11:52,412 --> 01:11:54,312
I'm calling the cops.

857
01:11:54,314 --> 01:11:56,481
Oh, you fucking bitch!

858
01:11:56,483 --> 01:11:58,449
I'll fucking kill you!

859
01:11:59,587 --> 01:12:03,024
Oh, you fucking bitch.

860
01:12:04,559 --> 01:12:06,525
I just wanna talk.

861
01:12:06,527 --> 01:12:08,661
I just wanna talk.
That's all I wanna do.

862
01:12:08,663 --> 01:12:09,795
I just wanna talk.

863
01:12:09,797 --> 01:12:12,667
I just wanna fucking talk.

864
01:12:14,434 --> 01:12:17,503
Oh, I could have
fucking loved you

865
01:12:17,505 --> 01:12:19,505
and you do this to me?

866
01:12:19,507 --> 01:12:22,608
I didn't fucking do anything.

867
01:12:22,610 --> 01:12:23,976
Oh, I could have been

868
01:12:23,978 --> 01:12:27,546
the best fucking thing
that you had.

869
01:13:58,973 --> 01:14:02,274
Hey, have you seen
those twist ties?

870
01:14:02,276 --> 01:14:05,179
There should be some
further to the back.

871
01:14:06,914 --> 01:14:08,082
Okay.

872
01:14:18,259 --> 01:14:19,860
Are we hiding back here now?

873
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:24,630
Are you still mad at that guy

874
01:14:24,632 --> 01:14:27,266
who tried to order
the soy latte?

875
01:14:29,136 --> 01:14:30,869
It was matcha.

876
01:14:30,871 --> 01:14:32,871
- Douche.
- What the fuck is matcha?

877
01:14:32,873 --> 01:14:35,009
Fuck if I know.

878
01:14:35,977 --> 01:14:37,144
You okay?

879
01:14:38,813 --> 01:14:42,049
Yeah. No. But it's fine.

880
01:14:42,717 --> 01:14:44,450
What's going on?

881
01:14:44,452 --> 01:14:45,753
It... Just...

882
01:14:46,721 --> 01:14:47,853
A lot going on.

883
01:14:47,855 --> 01:14:50,456
Just, you know, life.

884
01:14:50,458 --> 01:14:51,724
Yeah.

885
01:14:51,726 --> 01:14:54,526
Well, you know
you can talk to me, right?

886
01:14:54,528 --> 01:14:56,795
I mean, if,
you know, no pressure,

887
01:14:56,797 --> 01:14:58,799
but if you want to.

888
01:15:08,175 --> 01:15:10,309
Uh...

889
01:15:10,311 --> 01:15:12,411
You think
Terry would let me crash here

890
01:15:12,413 --> 01:15:14,213
- overnight?
- He... he

891
01:15:14,215 --> 01:15:16,215
I'm not gonna lie,
I've done it before,

892
01:15:16,217 --> 01:15:17,816
but it kind of sucks.

893
01:15:17,818 --> 01:15:19,318
Of course, you have.

894
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:21,920
Trust me, you don't...
You don't wanna stay here.

895
01:15:21,922 --> 01:15:23,889
But

896
01:15:23,891 --> 01:15:25,292
let me... let me walk you home.

897
01:15:25,926 --> 01:15:27,259
Come on.

898
01:15:30,297 --> 01:15:32,631
Do you have your keys?

899
01:15:32,633 --> 01:15:34,802
Uh, yeah.

900
01:15:36,737 --> 01:15:38,470
Later, Pasta Man.

901
01:15:40,875 --> 01:15:42,941
I'm...
Hungover right now.

902
01:15:42,943 --> 01:15:44,779
Oh, my God.
Maybe you should crash here.

903
01:15:49,917 --> 01:15:51,316
No, we are very closed.

904
01:15:51,318 --> 01:15:53,152
Very, very closed.

905
01:15:53,154 --> 01:15:54,586
Was that like that
the whole time?

906
01:15:54,588 --> 01:15:55,954
Maybe.

907
01:15:55,956 --> 01:15:57,691
- Oops.
- That would explain a lot.

908
01:16:19,346 --> 01:16:21,413
Kinda jealous of this coat
you have on right now.

909
01:16:21,415 --> 01:16:22,881
Right? Yeah.

910
01:16:22,883 --> 01:16:25,484
Uh, it's pretty fuzzy and warm.

911
01:16:25,486 --> 01:16:26,821
It is fuzzy.

912
01:16:27,288 --> 01:16:28,654
Yeah.

913
01:16:28,656 --> 01:16:29,688
It kinda looks like
you're wearing a bathrobe

914
01:16:29,690 --> 01:16:30,989
a little bit.

915
01:16:30,991 --> 01:16:32,391
Yeah, a little bit.
A little bit.

916
01:16:32,393 --> 01:16:33,358
But I don't...
I... I don't mind though.

917
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:34,726
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

918
01:16:34,728 --> 01:16:36,995
No, it's good.
It... it's... it's warm.

919
01:16:36,997 --> 01:16:38,397
Oh.

920
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:39,798
- Do you...
- Oh.

921
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:40,833
Do you want these back?

922
01:16:40,835 --> 01:16:43,135
I mean,
I could take 'em from you.

923
01:16:43,137 --> 01:16:44,903
- I could get 'em at work...
- Yeah.

924
01:16:44,905 --> 01:16:47,072
But I feel like I might get
beat up out here...

925
01:16:47,074 --> 01:16:48,207
Maybe.

926
01:16:48,209 --> 01:16:49,341
If I'm walking around
with these on.

927
01:16:49,343 --> 01:16:50,911
Your hair.

928
01:16:52,113 --> 01:16:53,011
Well

929
01:16:53,013 --> 01:16:55,481
you sure you're gonna be okay?

930
01:16:55,483 --> 01:16:57,218
I think I just need some time.

931
01:16:58,018 --> 01:16:59,218
Yeah.

932
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:02,223
Well, I'm here
if you need anything.

933
01:17:04,526 --> 01:17:06,692
Come here.

934
01:17:18,939 --> 01:17:20,307
- Good night.
- Good night.

935
01:17:44,633 --> 01:17:45,966
What the fuck, man?

936
01:17:47,001 --> 01:17:48,402
Dude, get outta here, man.

937
01:17:49,904 --> 01:17:52,072
Dude, she doesn't wanna
fucking see you, man.

938
01:19:51,693 --> 01:19:53,961
No! No!

939
01:19:56,897 --> 01:19:58,864
Henry, no, please.

940
01:19:58,866 --> 01:20:01,366
Henry, no. Stop, please.

941
01:20:01,368 --> 01:20:04,036
Don't. Please.

942
01:20:04,038 --> 01:20:06,773
Henry, no. Hey, hey, no.

943
01:20:06,775 --> 01:20:08,840
You don't wanna do this, please.

944
01:20:08,842 --> 01:20:12,012
Please don't. Please, no.

945
01:20:14,415 --> 01:20:17,084
Please don't. No.

946
01:20:19,987 --> 01:20:22,389
Please.

947
01:20:30,097 --> 01:20:31,999
No!

948
01:22:56,376 --> 01:22:57,512
Jensen.

949
01:22:58,646 --> 01:23:00,180
I believe Henry's ready.

950
01:24:55,262 --> 01:24:57,331
<i>I want a divorce.</i>

951
01:25:01,736 --> 01:25:03,370
And why is that?

952
01:25:04,171 --> 01:25:06,772
<i>Everything.</i>

953
01:25:06,774 --> 01:25:10,610
<i>There's no talking to you.</i>
<i>There's no communication.</i>

954
01:25:10,612 --> 01:25:15,014
<i>You're miles away</i>
<i>and no way to reach you.</i>

955
01:25:21,990 --> 01:25:23,323
Wow.

956
01:25:25,059 --> 01:25:26,393
I can't be reached?

957
01:25:27,829 --> 01:25:31,198
Every time I try to talk to you,
you won't respond.

958
01:25:32,332 --> 01:25:34,533
Every time I try to touch you,

959
01:25:34,535 --> 01:25:37,471
you run halfway across the room.

960
01:25:40,474 --> 01:25:41,743
So don't

961
01:25:42,844 --> 01:25:45,245
give me that bullshit.

962
01:25:50,918 --> 01:25:52,553
Williams.

963
01:25:55,188 --> 01:25:56,524
Williams.

964
01:25:58,693 --> 01:25:59,827
Williams.

965
01:26:01,729 --> 01:26:02,864
And why is that?

966
01:26:04,164 --> 01:26:05,499
What?

967
01:26:06,299 --> 01:26:07,635
Are you okay?

968
01:26:10,805 --> 01:26:11,939
I'm fine.

969
01:26:13,373 --> 01:26:14,709
What's the word?

970
01:26:15,677 --> 01:26:16,811
He's not here.

971
01:26:18,146 --> 01:26:19,479
We found more.

972
01:26:22,282 --> 01:26:23,618
Okay.

973
01:26:45,773 --> 01:26:48,473
This is going to be
very difficult.

974
01:26:48,475 --> 01:26:50,545
So please take your time.

975
01:26:57,919 --> 01:26:59,520
I don't even know.

976
01:27:03,658 --> 01:27:04,557
I was...

977
01:27:04,559 --> 01:27:07,026
I... I just

978
01:27:07,028 --> 01:27:08,863
I was getting ready for bed.

979
01:27:09,864 --> 01:27:10,898
I just...

980
01:27:11,699 --> 01:27:13,298
Like

981
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:14,902
that song came on.

982
01:27:18,206 --> 01:27:21,341
He w... he was just on me.

983
01:27:22,275 --> 01:27:24,011
And I didn't know what to do.

984
01:27:29,483 --> 01:27:31,719
He tried to put it in my mouth.

985
01:27:34,555 --> 01:27:37,957
I just kept grabbing
for something.

986
01:27:37,959 --> 01:27:41,093
I didn't think...
I... I didn't wanna hurt him.

987
01:27:41,095 --> 01:27:43,564
I just wanted to get him off me.

988
01:27:45,767 --> 01:27:48,736
And I just grabbed
the first thing that I felt.

989
01:30:35,102 --> 01:30:37,036
Detective Williams.

990
01:30:37,038 --> 01:30:38,471
So glad you could come.

991
01:30:39,507 --> 01:30:41,474
Have I done something wrong?

992
01:30:49,050 --> 01:30:50,184
Thank you for that.

993
01:30:51,752 --> 01:30:54,689
So now maybe you can tell me
what brings you here.

994
01:30:57,291 --> 01:30:59,124
Treatment, perhaps?

995
01:30:59,126 --> 01:31:01,862
The name
Henry Adams ring any bells?

996
01:31:03,164 --> 01:31:04,462
Adams?

997
01:31:04,464 --> 01:31:07,068
I'm afraid I'm at a loss.

998
01:31:08,436 --> 01:31:09,902
It's funny.

999
01:31:09,904 --> 01:31:13,505
I keep finding your books
all over our crime scenes.

1000
01:31:15,543 --> 01:31:18,344
Our line of work
always attracts the more

1001
01:31:18,346 --> 01:31:19,981
disturbed characters.

1002
01:31:22,083 --> 01:31:24,484
So, Detective Williams

1003
01:31:25,353 --> 01:31:26,721
what happened now?

1004
01:31:27,221 --> 01:31:28,556
Guess.

1005
01:31:29,357 --> 01:31:30,522
It's probably safe to say

1006
01:31:30,524 --> 01:31:32,793
he committed some particularly

1007
01:31:34,028 --> 01:31:35,262
awful actions.

1008
01:31:36,430 --> 01:31:37,798
I guess you
could say that.

1009
01:31:41,635 --> 01:31:43,070
What's with
the creepy setup, Doc?

1010
01:31:44,572 --> 01:31:45,906
Preparations.

1011
01:31:46,974 --> 01:31:48,607
Uh-huh.

1012
01:31:48,609 --> 01:31:50,509
Detective Williams

1013
01:31:50,511 --> 01:31:52,878
your attitude is quite telling.

1014
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,215
Enough of the runaround.

1015
01:31:55,282 --> 01:31:56,849
I'm not here
for treatment.

1016
01:31:56,851 --> 01:31:58,185
Why are you here?

1017
01:32:00,788 --> 01:32:02,554
Maybe you don't know
why you're here.

1018
01:32:02,556 --> 01:32:03,891
Said enough.

1019
01:32:05,226 --> 01:32:06,358
I just wanna know...

1020
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:09,797
You wanna know about the worms?

1021
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:14,135
Don't move!

1022
01:32:15,669 --> 01:32:16,702
Son of a bitch.

1023
01:34:49,658 --> 01:34:53,859
Detective Williams,
how nice of you to join us.

1024
01:34:53,861 --> 01:34:57,062
We have quite
the evening planned for you.

1025
01:34:59,668 --> 01:35:01,769
You son of a bitch!

1026
01:35:02,503 --> 01:35:05,304
Oh, Detective Williams,

1027
01:35:05,306 --> 01:35:08,575
you don't see
that I'm trying to help you.

1028
01:35:08,577 --> 01:35:11,977
Resentment, anger, repression.

1029
01:35:11,979 --> 01:35:14,915
Everything that cripples you
as a man.

1030
01:35:16,016 --> 01:35:18,150
I can change all that for you.

1031
01:35:18,152 --> 01:35:22,154
Sir, I don't think
this is the best idea.

1032
01:35:22,156 --> 01:35:23,422
It's not like

1033
01:35:23,424 --> 01:35:24,823
we're gonna let him
out of the box.

1034
01:35:27,261 --> 01:35:29,129
Let's get on with this,
shall we?

1035
01:35:30,798 --> 01:35:32,900
Greta, would you be so kind?

1036
01:35:43,545 --> 01:35:45,846
Thank you,
darling. Doctor.

1037
01:35:55,657 --> 01:35:56,991
Thank you, Henry.

1038
01:36:10,538 --> 01:36:11,872
Stop!

1039
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:35,829
Oh. That's a beauty, huh?

1040
01:36:41,001 --> 01:36:42,367
Are you ready,
Detective Williams?

1041
01:36:42,369 --> 01:36:43,902
No, no, no!

1042
01:36:43,904 --> 01:36:46,874
You sick fucking psychopath!

1043
01:36:47,509 --> 01:36:48,842
No!

1044
01:36:49,577 --> 01:36:51,843
No, no, no!

1045
01:36:51,845 --> 01:36:53,579
Why are you doing this?

1046
01:36:53,581 --> 01:36:56,982
To relieve you
of the burden of consciousness.

1047
01:36:56,984 --> 01:36:59,418
No, no, no, no!

1048
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:02,454
Oh, God! No, no, no, no!

1049
01:37:04,559 --> 01:37:07,326
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1050
01:38:02,916 --> 01:38:05,553
Please. Please, no.

1051
01:38:56,236 --> 01:38:57,502
I know you're gonna find this

1052
01:38:57,504 --> 01:38:59,070
hard to believe,
but I have a joke...

1053
01:38:59,072 --> 01:39:00,472
- Yeah?
- For you.

1054
01:39:00,474 --> 01:39:02,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah..
I... I got a joke for you.

1055
01:39:02,242 --> 01:39:03,843
- I got a joke for you.
- All right. All right.

1056
01:39:03,845 --> 01:39:05,310
All right, so this airplane's
going down, right?

1057
01:39:05,312 --> 01:39:06,579
- Yeah.
- Everybody's gonna die.

1058
01:39:06,581 --> 01:39:08,146
There's nobody
surviving on this thing.

1059
01:39:08,148 --> 01:39:09,448
This woman jumps up
from her seat,

1060
01:39:09,450 --> 01:39:11,383
tears off all of her clothes
and goes,

1061
01:39:11,385 --> 01:39:13,351
"Is there any man
big enough here

1062
01:39:13,353 --> 01:39:14,953
to make me feel like a woman?"

1063
01:39:14,955 --> 01:39:16,354
Right, right?

1064
01:39:16,356 --> 01:39:17,757
So, a guy stands up
and tears off his shirt

1065
01:39:17,759 --> 01:39:20,160
and goes, "Yeah,."

1066
01:39:22,229 --> 01:39:24,498
Hey, you're not
such a tight ass after all.

1067
01:39:26,901 --> 01:39:30,035
Well, you're oddly personable,
all things considering.

1068
01:39:30,037 --> 01:39:32,872
Yeah, well,
I'm feeling pretty good.

1069
01:39:32,874 --> 01:39:34,308
No sense in
dwelling on it.

1070
01:39:35,275 --> 01:39:36,611
Kind of a big thing.

1071
01:39:37,077 --> 01:39:38,644
Uh...

1072
01:39:38,646 --> 01:39:40,646
Yeah. Sorry.

1073
01:39:40,648 --> 01:39:43,050
Looks like you're stuck
with just plain black today.
