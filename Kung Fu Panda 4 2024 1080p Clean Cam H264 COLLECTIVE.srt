Successor for what?

112

119
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:03,446
Exactly.

120
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:04,989
Then what am I going to be?

121
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,908
Once a successor is chosen, you will

122
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:07,784

It's just like Master Uglie before you.

128

You will oversee the Valley, passing

along wisdom and aspiring hope.

130
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,302
Look, I appreciate the promotion.

131
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,554
I think it was just going to stick with

132
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,014
the whole Dragon Warrior thing.

133
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,599

134
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,226
What is it you're hoping?

135
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,310

The Staff of Wisdom?

138
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,273
It was given to you by Master Uglie.

139
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:40,817
You couldn't really think it was so you

140
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,400
could open a

141
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,819
restaurant for both textures.

142
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,737
You wasn't super specific?

143
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,073
Uglie entrusted you with that staff.

144
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,492
So you could follow in his footsteps and

145
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,118
become something

146
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,577
better than you already are.

147
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:53,538
You take it.

148
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:54,205
No.

149
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,957
Uglie did not give it to me.

150
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,084
Paving the next Uglie is not my destiny,

151
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,293
which I have accepted

152
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,878
and am at peace with.

153
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:01,879
Really, it's fine.

154
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:02,964
You don't sound fine.

155
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:03,840
You don't sound fine.

156
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,507
I'm very fine.

157
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,550
It's okay to be your prize.

158
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,259
This is an honor.

159
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,262
Uglie chose you as his successor and now

160
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,638
you must choose yours.

161
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,932
Master Shifu, I finally found something

162
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,225
I'm good at and now you want

163
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,393
to just take it away from me?

164
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,353
No one was taking anything away, Po.

165
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,980
Who you are will always be

166
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,189
a part of what you become.

167
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,983
Yeah, but where's this caduce?

168
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:23,025
You know what I mean?

169
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:23,985
The shh of worry!

170
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,028
I don't want to seem ungrateful, but I

171
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,280
don't know anything about passing on

172
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,656
wisdom or inspiring hope.

173
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,408
All I know are two things.

174
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,619
Kicking butt and taking names.

175
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,663
And if I'm being completely honest, I'm

176
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:36,956
not even that good at the name taking.

177
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:37,957
Like, who's that

178
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,208
fire-breathing crocodile?

179
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,376
I want to say Steve?

180
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,586
You were chosen to

181
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,920
bring peace to the valley.

182
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,881
And there are other ways to bring peace

183
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,091
than simply kicking butt.

184
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,552
Well, sure, but not any fun ones.

185
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:50,344
Please!

186
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,847
Being the Dragon Warrior is all I know.

187
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,265
It's who I am!

188
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:54,765
Not anymore.

189
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,559
The Valley of Peace needs a spiritual

190
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,769
leader and Master Uglie chose you.

191
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,688
You'll start interviewing candidates

192
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,231
first thing tomorrow morning.

193
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,233
Candidates? What candidates?

194
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:16,120
Awesome!

195
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,552
Got you.

196
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,262
Fantastic pose.

197
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:44,857
Woo hoo!

198
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:45,399
Nice!

199
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,111
Master Poe will now

200
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:52,031
choose the next Dragon Warrior.

201
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,334
So many great candidates.

202
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,628
I'm gonna let the finger decide.

203
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:07,463
Wait.

204
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:09,507
Whoa, whoa.

205
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,633
What is happening?

206
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,094
The Dragon Warrior!

207
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:14,220
It's me!

208
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:21,686
If I could have not told you,

209
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,020
I'd have to choose a successor.

210
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,189
Nothing about them

211
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,108
says Dragon or Warrior.

212
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,943
You will know what you know.

213
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,319
How do I know when I know?

214
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:31,529
You know?

215
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,824
When I'm conflicted, I come here to ask

216
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,200
the universe for answers,

217
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,994
just as Uglie did before me.

218
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,912
I'm not conflicted, I'm

219
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,330
just not ready for a next step.

220
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,373
What is that you're holding?

221
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,624
The Staff of Wisdom?

222
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:44,834
Otherhand.

223
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:46,586
A Chewed-Up Peace Bed?

224
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:47,420
Exactly.

225
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:49,922
Every pit holds the

226
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,799
promise of a mighty tree.

227
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,593
How is this gonna help me find answers?

228
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:55,845
Don't ask me.

229
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,596
Ask the universe.

230
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,098
Be the pit, Poe.

231
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,474
Be the pit?

232
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,645
Yeah, there we go.

233
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,397
Alright, universe.

234
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,899
Give me some guidance.

235
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:11,986
Inner peace.

236
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,113
Inner peace.

237
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,115
Inner peace.

238
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:18,034
Dinner, please.

239
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,161
Dinner with peas.

240
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,121
Snow peas.

241
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,707
And a sesame soy glaze.

242
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:25,458
Argh!

243
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,043
Inner peace.

244
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:28,961
Inner peace.

245
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,215
This is not working at all.

246
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,967
Maybe focus on your breathing.

247
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,385
I'm trying, but it's kinda

248
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,845
hard when you keep talking to me.

249
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,305
Technically, you're talking

250
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,015
to you if you think about it.

251
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,224
Will you two be quiet?

252
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,517
I'm trying to concentrate here.

253
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:44,644
Wait, if my Poe's inner

254
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,644
voice, then who are you?

255
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,688
Uh, I'm Poe's inner voice.

256
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,565
How many voices do I have in there?

257
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,900
You do not want to know.

258
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,401
I just love you.

259
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,361
What am I gonna be?

260
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,570
Are we alone in universe?

261
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,529
Did I talk about something?

262
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:56,947
I'm not gonna be.

263
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,699
I'm not gonna be.

264
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:59,950
You are gonna be.

265
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:07,249
Universe?

266
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,087
Is that you?

267
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:21,931
Attention mysterious fandier.

268
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,566
The dragon warriors

269
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,985
here took her for justice.

270
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:41,951
I know you're in here just a matter of

271
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,204
time before I find you.

272
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,038
Ooh.

273
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:57,007
You can't hide from justice forever.

274
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,140
The dagger of Dengua.

275
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:05,766
You've got excellent

276
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:06,934
taste. I'll give you that.

277
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,186
But I can't give you that. Give it back.

278
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,438
If you insist.

279
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:25,703
Oh no! He's got a walking stick.

280
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:26,036
What are you gonna

281
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,204
do, stroll me to death?

282
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,998
This stick is not for the strolling.

283
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,875
It's the staff of wisdom.

284
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,585
The dragon warrior is gonna be mad when

285
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,919
he finds out you took his stick.

286
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,337
I am the dragon warrior.

287
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:37,798
I'm just gonna say nothing

288
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,967
about you says dragon or warrior.

289
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,010
Yes!

290
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:57,651
You desecrate the holo-gira.

291
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,112
Who's desecrating what now?

292
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,281
That's your ostrich you say.

293
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:03,365
No, it's not bad.

294
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,826
You destructible chain

295
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,203
hammer of faster fangirls.

296
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,078
Whoopsies.

297
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:14,835
[gasping]

298
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,588
[gasping]

299
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,549
[laughing]

300
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,801
Beat the hand of whispering warriors,

301
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,970
which I've already broken. Twice!

302
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,015
Why would you keep an urn of souls?

303
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,391
Feels kind of creepy.

304
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:33,979
Are you doing okay there, big guy?

305
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,189
You're looking a little tired.

306
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,398
I've never felt more.

307
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,862
The warrior of faster chubac?

308
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,867
You're gonna pay for that.

309
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,828
[gasping]

310
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:51,121
Hello?

311
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,461
[grunting]

312
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,175
You faker!

313
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,219
It's not faking. It's called method.

314
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,179
Catch you later, panda.

315
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,014
No!

316
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:14,812
[grunting]

317
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,648
I think I'll catch you now.

318
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:22,736
[grunting]

319
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:23,028
Whoa!

320
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,741
[grunting]

321
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:28,617
I'm not a guy!

322
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:31,912
Whoa!

323
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:34,540
Whoa!

324
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,044
Told ya!

325
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,921
You got me. Oh, great, a

326
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,339
powerful dumpling warrior.

327
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:43,549
That's dragon warrior!

328
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,635
Let go of me!

329
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,179
Just tell me one thing. How could someone

330
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,514
like you become the dragon warrior?

331
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,308
That's a mystery for you to solve during

332
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,309
your two years day at

333
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,476
the Valley of Peace Prison.

334
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:55,561
Valley of Peace Prison?

335
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:57,229
Sounds like a daycare.

336
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,606
It is a daycare on the

337
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,899
weekends, but it's also a prison.

338
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:02,234
There it is!

339
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:03,485
Dragon warrior!

340
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:05,696
My oldest, my long-nest returned.

341
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,656
He demanded all of our items, then

342
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,532
destroyed our quarry!

343
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,409
He's supposed to be the spirit world.

344
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,202
Well, he's fastened, and he's not going

345
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,079
to stop until the Valley of Peace falls,

346
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,998
and the dragon warrior bows before him.

347
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,333
He's fastened!

348
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,667
Please, you've got to do something!

349
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,045
Looks like I'm not the only one around

350
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,296
here with a mystery to solve.

351
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,256
Well, you know what they say.

352
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,300
Every step leaves a

353
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,011
footprint, no matter how small.

354
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:50,324
Every step leaves a

355
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,661
footprint, no matter how small.

356
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:53,869
Every step leaves a footprint, no matter how small.

357
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,293
Very clever, Fox. You know something.

358
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,253
Maybe I do. Maybe I don't.

359
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:05,923
Okay, I do. I really, really do.

360
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:06,590
Tell me.

361
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,050
And why should I? I don't

362
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:08,759
know what's in it for me.

363
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,802
The peace of mind knowing

364
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:10,969
you did the right thing.

365
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:12,179
You're adorable. I

366
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,138
don't ever tell you that.

367
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,139
And I don't even just

368
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:14,973
look at my cuddly side.

369
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,266
I don't have time for games.

370
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,518
Tylon is running loose

371
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,477
in the Valley of Peace.

372
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,896
Maybe, or maybe she wants

373
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,523
you to think it was Tylon.

374
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:23,774
Wait. She?

375
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:24,441
Mine.

376
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,153
The Empress of the Sky is capable of

377
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,280
taking any form, mimicking anything.

378
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,657
The Master of Deception.

379
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,117
The lizard of lies with

380
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,159
the glowing teal eyes.

381
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,204
Stop talking about the chameleon.

382
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,959
This is kind of a private conversation.

383
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:44,670
Who's the chameleon?

384
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,171
Only the most powerful

385
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,756
shape-shifting sorceress.

386
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,591
So she's shape-shifted in the Tylon!

387
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,176
But what does she have

388
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,344
against me in the Valley of Peace?

389
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:53,512
These are good questions.

390
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:54,930
You should ask her.

391
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:55,305
You're right.

392
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,434
How do I find this the chameleon?

393
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,852
She isn't someone who can be found.

394
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,980
At least not without someone in the know.

395
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,024
And how do I find someone in the know?

396
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,152
No. It's me. It's

397
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,653
obviously, it's me. I'm in the know.

398
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:10,487
I mean, I'm in the know.

399
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:13,365
I'll find her on my own.

400
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,909
Good luck. After all, how hard can it be

401
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,077
to find someone who can look

402
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,579
like anyone blended anywhere?

403
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,127
Fine. You lead me to the chameleon and

404
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:25,961
I'll see what I can do

405
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,171
about reducing your sentence.

406
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,088
Deal.

407
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,259
What do you think you're doing?

408
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,844
There's this

409
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,679
shape-shifting sorceress on the loose.

410
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,681
That's a job for the Furious Five.

411
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,391
Well, they're not here and someone needs

412
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:39,975
to protect the Valley of Peace.

413
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,728
Look, I know the change is difficult and

414
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,022
that you enjoy being the Dragon Warrior,

415
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,232
but your job is finding a successor.

416
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,359
The Dragon Warrior and I have a deal. My

417
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,652
drone business, squirrel.

418
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,488
Mr. Shifu is not a squirrel.

419
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,822
I'm a red panda.

420
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,034
You know what? I love that for you.

421
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,661
Poe, this is your decision, but I think

422
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,079
you know the choice Master

423
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,998
Oakley would want you to make.

424
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:08,962
Thanks for the freeze day.

425
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,088
What do you mean?

426
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:10,380
What do you mean?

427
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,256
Not bad for a daycare.

428
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,341
Wait, not bad for a daycare.

429
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:12,925
There she goes.

430
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,260
Okay, please. Don't worry. I'll have her

431
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,137
back before you even know she was gone.

432
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,722
You were supposed to be passing along

433
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,474
with her and inspiring all.

434
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,184
Just think of it. It's one last Dragon

435
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,394
Warrior adventure. I'll be back soon.

436
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,646
Tell my dads I love them. I

437
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,147
can't hear you anymore. Bye!

438
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,444
Yeah! It sure is good

439
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,821
to be a free fox again.

440
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,739
That's a yay, backscratcher.

441
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:35,989
Yay!

442
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,116
So does this really unlock

443
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:39,201
the door to the spirit realm?

444
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:40,744
It doesn't work like that.

445
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,037
It has to be given in

446
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,205
order to gain its powers.

447
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,875
Gotcha. Given to gain. So, can I have a--

448
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,293
No! What do you take me for?

449
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,169
An easy mark.

450
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,546
What's an easy mark?

451
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,506
Someone who's easy to steal from. Usually

452
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,590
because they're generous

453
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,925
and too trusting. Like you.

454
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,218
Ah, thank you.

455
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,348
I heard the chameleon is a monster with

456
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,517
an appetite of a thousand predators and

457
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,977
her favorite food is panda.

458
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,938
And I say this chameleon, Erica has

459
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,566
magical powers. If you say her name three

460
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,860
times, she'll take you away in the night.

461
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,195
This new one?

462
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,364
How should she look like anything?

463
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,199
It is you for you.

464
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,330
Mr. Lee, Mr. Lee, is it true?

465
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,456
I was going to take

466
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,041
down an evil sorcerer?

467
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,960
Don't know chameleon.

468
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,088
Dragon Warrior's work is never done.

469
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,133
I'm thinking Paul using up with the

470
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,843
commitment fella to take down an evil

471
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,470
sorceress. Who wasn't such a great idea?

472
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,266
Relax. Poe has faced demons, demigods,

473
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,893
and everything else in between. He's

474
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:46,852
always coming on top.

475
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,729
And you're right. You're right.

476
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,480
I thought if you're wrong--

477
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,400
Calm down, Ping. How bad

478
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,485
can one evil sorceress be?

479
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,698
Who is she to summon us?

480
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,409
Classic power move. We're the heads of

481
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:03,285
Jina for Citi's most

482
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,661
prominent crying family.

483
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,914
Is she just a bug-eyed, power-hungry

484
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,081
reptilian who runs--

485
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,042
You left out the evil sorceress part.

486
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,961
We used to run the city. Now we pay her

487
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,338
half the money for the twiddle.

488
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,714
It's like a primo can't

489
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,174
make an honest living anymore.

490
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,675
Yeah, but what can we do?

491
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,803
Together, we can take her down.

492
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:22,721
Oh, no.

493
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,556
But not if she's a shape-shifter.

494
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,391
She could be at this very

495
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,477
table, and we'd have no idea.

496
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,397
For all we know, you're the chameleon.

497
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,024
Or you're the chameleon.

498
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,108
Or maybe--

499
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:35,943
Oh, no.

500
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:36,610
Maybe.

501
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,736
Don't say it.

502
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,030
I'm the chameleon.

503
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,031
I said don't say it.

504
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:50,582
We obviously spoke out of turn.

505
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:51,416
Sorry, chameleon.

506
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,085
No, no, don't apologize.

507
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,004
You and your families prospered by

508
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:56,964
preying upon the weak.

509
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,549
So it doesn't feel good when

510
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,385
you're the one being squeezed,

511
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,679
especially when the one doing the

512
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,138
squeezing is just a

513
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,432
bug-eyed, power-hungry.

514
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,059
How was the rest?

515
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,019
Reptilian Runt.

516
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:15,190
Well, this reptilian runt wants more.

517
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,068
You already have the city. What else

518
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,194
could you possibly want?

519
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,113
I have something special in mind.

520
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,448
I am very close to achieving it.

521
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,993
As close as the blood moon.

522
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,995
The blood moon is two nights away.

523
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,497
So little times, so many expenses,

524
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,041
which is why I'll need to increase this

525
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,210
month's tribute to 60%.

526
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:37,045
No.

527
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,135
What was that now?

528
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,887
I mean, no disrespect.

529
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,016
Don't worry.

530
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,268
I forgive you.

531
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,564
For the impudence, and the backstabbing,

532
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:56,857
and the blatant

533
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,693
disrespect you've shown me.

534
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:00,610
I forgive.

535
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,321
But I never forget.

536
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,408
You might say I have the memory.

537
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:07,576
Oh, don't say it.

538
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,161
Of an elephant.

539
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:28,388
You think I pushed you too far?

540
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:32,267
Then you, my friend, can't begin to fail.

541
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,229
Just how far I can pull.

542
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:44,988
I'd expect your tributes by dawn.

543
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:51,912
Are we gonna stop for lunch soon?

544
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,081
Justice doesn't stop for lunch.

545
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,040
But it does take the

546
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,750
occasional time out for snackage.

547
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,251
Wanna split my almond cookie?

548
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:00,629
You're just gonna give me half of your

549
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,339
cookie out of the goodness of your heart?

550
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:02,881
Mm-hmm.

551
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,716
What's the catch? The rum, the bamboozle?

552
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:05,425
The bam-waddle?

553
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,635
You know, the fleece,

554
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,511
the rump, the flint-wam.

555
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,845
Do you want the cookie or not?

556
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:11,723
[mumbling]

557
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,017
I got my eye on you.

558
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,687
How much farther is it

559
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:18,897
to this, the chameleon?

560
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:19,773
Just a little.

561
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:34,162
[screaming]

562
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,749
Please! What are you throwing out here in

563
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:38,625
the middle of the night?

564
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,128
I... I didn't want a

565
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,379
mis-scurbing blood moon rising.

566
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:42,963
Oh, cool.

567
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,632
You are just as worried as I am.

568
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:46,383
Right, alright.

569
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,718
I know Panda's come across as calm,

570
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:49,886
gentle and chill, but...

571
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:53,140
The truth is, I'm kind of freaking out!

572
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,851
Who am I? Who is it too calm, gentle and

573
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,562
chill to face a sheepshifting sorceress?

574
00:23:58,895 --> 00:23:59,813
What if he's captured?

575
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:00,689
What if he's tortured?

576
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,649
Our baby!

577
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,527
Okay, okay.

578
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,530
Maybe Po has finally met his match, but

579
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,907
there's still something that he has that

580
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:11,992
the comedian does not.

581
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:12,868
What's that?

582
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:14,077
Us!

583
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,039
Now, let's go find our son, my proposal.

584
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:21,751
You know, Nate, a wise goose, once said,

585
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:22,961
"Worrying doesn't make

586
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,838
the broth boil any faster."

587
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,797
Who was that?

588
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,383
Me, of course. I was the wise goose.

589
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,593
Oh, yeah.

590
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:31,219
Whoa!

591
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,138
That's the biggest

592
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,222
village I've ever seen.

593
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,893
That's no village. That's Cunever City.

594
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:38,810
That's where I'll

595
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,978
find the chameleon, huh?

596
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,981
Just a boat ride away, and I'm gonna lead

597
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,065
you right to our front door.

598
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,025
Are you sure we'll find

599
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,026
a boat captain in there?

600
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,611
For the right price. Those cup throws

601
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,070
will take us anywhere we want to go.

602
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,364
Of course, we could always opt for the

603
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:52,782
four-finger discount.

604
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:56,244
No stealing. The Happy Bunny Tavern.

605
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:57,787
That sounds inviting.

606
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:58,830
No!

607
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,753
Anybody lose a rabbit?

608
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,469
Oh, that's a giant bastard!

609
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:17,933
Welcome to the Happy Bunny Tavern.

610
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,227
I'll find us a ride, maybe you can get us

611
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,687
some food, and stay out of trouble.

612
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,566
Hey, what you guys playing?

613
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,778
Ah, John, at the stage, sir, hi.

614
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:30,779
Can I play?

615
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:33,031
Surely you'll go easy on a beginner,

616
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,032
because I'm near your beginning.

617
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,286
Hey there, what can I get you?

618
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,121
A boat ride to Cunever City.

619
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:40,872
Oh, this guy.

620
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,460
Who's he? He's the captain.

621
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:46,628
Thanks.

622
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,050
Oh, I want to get him.

623
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,301
Beginner's luck, I guess.

624
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:54,469
Emma, play me four.

625
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,930
Are you accusing me of cheating?

626
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,139
I would like to speak

627
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,182
to the manager, please.

628
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,976
I am the manager.

629
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,270
I'll give you a boat ride to Cunever

630
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,231
City, but I won't carry anything illegal.

631
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,565
I don't want any trouble.

632
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:09,567
Trouble runs for me.

633
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,861
Then he'll cost you double. I'm confused.

634
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,280
Should I have said that I like trouble?

635
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,365
In that case, he'll cost you triple.

636
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,118
Maybe we can go back to double price?

637
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,706
You got a deal. Great.

638
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,833
Do I shake his hand or your hand?

639
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,877
Can I give anything else to me now?

640
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,005
Yes, everything. Again, except for the

641
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,256
rock. It was very bland.

642
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:32,424
He's starting!

643
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,218
Whoa! One of

644
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,720
everything is my go-to order.

645
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,055
But how did you pay for this?

646
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,640
Freebilly, lawfully, fair and square.

647
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,309
I'm proud of you.

648
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:54,946
Oh, wow. Look at the time. Remember we

649
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:55,697
had to do that thing?

650
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:56,698
Now I'm out of place with that guy.

651
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,159
Did you actually think you

652
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,911
could drift a meal out of me?

653
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:03,913
There's got to be some sort of

654
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:04,956
misunderstanding here.

655
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,209
And apparently I'm the

656
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,044
one misunderstanding.

657
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:10,795
Please allow us to pay

658
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,339
for our meal and yours.

659
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,549
Because I am only hungry far.

660
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,009
Don't think spend it.

661
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,136
Well then, come and get it.

662
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,221
No, no, no, no! Don't come and get it!

663
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,389
Destroy them!

664
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:28,146
Yeah!

665
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:35,862
Ahh! I got it!

666
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:47,165
There you go.

667
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,667
Oh, Banner.

668
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:52,420
Gotcha.

669
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,339
You need to start it.

670
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:22,117
Ahh!

671
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,369
I'll take that.

672
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:30,917
I think it belongs to you.

673
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:42,846
Go, Steely!

674
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:50,019
Yeah, I think it's a

675
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,104
little too late for that.

676
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:51,813
It's never too late

677
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:52,856
to do the right thing.

678
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:54,566
No. Get them!

679
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:58,361
Yeah!

680
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:14,627
Whoa, nice move.

681
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,004
You gotta teach me that.

682
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:16,880
Yeah, guys!

683
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,216
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

684
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:20,675
Whoa!

685
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,262
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

686
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,099
Ahh!

687
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:31,478
Ahh!

688
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:31,644
Hello.

689
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:33,521
Ahh!

690
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:38,568
Who designed the timer on a glass?

691
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:39,194
We shouldn't have

692
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,278
eaten all those duck wings.

693
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,488
Ahh!

694
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:42,989
Huh?

695
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:45,950
Ahh!

696
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,705
Hell, ho!

697
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:57,504
Ahh!

698
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,133
Ahh!

699
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:04,636
Not that I'm worried, but...

700
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:05,470
Ahh!

701
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,388
What if the chameleon knows we're coming?

702
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,098
Well, she could be anywhere.

703
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:09,641
Anyone.

704
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,226
Lee, would you please

705
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,477
show a little backbone?

706
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:13,645
I'm sorry.

707
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,231
The bravery was never really my special.

708
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:16,940
Ahh!

709
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,399
You don't have to be brave.

710
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,527
You just have to act brave.

711
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:21,945
Act brave.

712
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,112
Got it!

713
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:24,239
Ahh!

714
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:24,948
Ahh!

715
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:26,783
Ahh!

716
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:27,909
Ahh!

717
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:28,284
Ahh!

718
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,119
Oh, baby!

719
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,247
Oh, this is nothing!

720
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:33,373
No!

721
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,541
I'm too real!

722
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,001
Ahh!

723
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,838
How was that for acty brave?

724
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,508
Keep prepping on it.

725
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,764
Juniper City, it's going to

726
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,140
be great to be back home again.

727
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,600
Does your family live there too?

728
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:53,434
They would.

729
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,896
If I had a family, it wasn't easy being a

730
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,147
little fox in a big city.

731
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,526
So I had to survive any way I could.

732
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,780
I'm being...chilling...gaffing...

733
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,197
Stop running!

734
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:07,615
Stop running!

735
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,915
Whoa, you're an orphan? So am I!

736
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,000
Well, I mean, I was.

737
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,627
My goose dad adopted me, and then later

738
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,087
my panda dad found me.

739
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,964
Goose dads! Panda dads!

740
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,800
Guess it takes all kinds. Right, mom?

741
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,679
Then, one day a local took me in, put a

742
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,972
roof over my head, gave me

743
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,515
clothes to wear, food to eat.

744
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,059
After that, I was never alone again.

745
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,102
I guess we both got lucky.

746
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:36,728
I guess.

747
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,229
Hey, tell me something.

748
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,815
Back in the Valley of Geese, what did

749
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,233
that angry little squirrel mean?

750
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:42,609
Red Panda.

751
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:43,776
When he said you had

752
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:44,861
to find your successor.

753
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,905
Now that I'm supposed to become spiritual

754
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:49,907
leader, I have to find a worthy successor

755
00:31:49,907 --> 00:31:51,534
to take over as the Dragon Warrior.

756
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,620
That's where you want to stay, right?

757
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:54,621
No, it's just that...

758
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,205
What do I know about being a spiritual

759
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,665
leader? I can't even come up with one of

760
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:58,916
those cool sounding proverbs.

761
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,251
Life's greatest enemy

762
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,546
is...uh, I don't know...stairs?

763
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:04,964
Okay.

764
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,924
Everyone knows life's

765
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:08,009
greatest enemy is time.

766
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,220
I guess it's just easier to hold on to

767
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,096
the life you know than

768
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,681
move on to the one you don't.

769
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:14,724
Hey, that was pretty good.

770
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,727
Yeah, maybe she should be the spiritual

771
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:18,978
leader of the Valley of Geese.

772
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:23,691
Boom, that guy. He drinks like a fest.

773
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:50,802
Should he be driving? We've come to pay

774
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,345
tribute as you requested.

775
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,639
Looks a little light. Go

776
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,057
back out and get me more.

777
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:56,974
More?

778
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:58,643
For chameleon.

779
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,269
Go before I toss you down

780
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,396
another flight of stairs.

781
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,439
How bad was your flight of stairs?

782
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:07,360
At last, my destiny approaches.

783
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:14,951
I expand my rule from the city to every

784
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,619
city and town and village.

785
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,996
From here to the Valley of Geese.

786
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:19,997
And beyond!

787
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:29,590
We all know the name of the chameleon.

788
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:33,594
Shin, I had a vision.

789
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:34,762
I saw the chameleon.

790
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,848
She's gonna take over cities and towns

791
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,015
and the Valley of Geese.

792
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:41,728
A vision? While you were asleep. I'm

793
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:42,520
pretty sure that's just a dream.

794
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,314
Not a dream! A vision. Either I had a bad

795
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:45,982
dumpling before I went to sleep

796
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,317
or it's a dragon warrior thing.

797
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:48,860
We gotta get to the

798
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,069
chameleon and figure it out!

799
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,529
Well then, you're in

800
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,906
luck. Welcome to Juniver City.

801
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:05,126
This is the place where you can be

802
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,252
whatever you want to be.

803
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:09,130
Do whatever you want to do and steal

804
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,048
whatever you want to steal.

805
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:12,592
I think that's your thing.

806
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,931
Whoa! That came out of nowhere.

807
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:33,696
I'm sorry.

808
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,201
I've never seen so much traffic before.

809
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,285
You don't have rush hour

810
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:40,328
in the Valley of Geese?

811
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,579
No one's ever in that much of a rush.

812
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:44,665
Come on!

813
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,751
Get out!

814
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,004
The only thing that

815
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,547
matters is good to be home again.

816
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,132
The sights. The sounds.

817
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:55,676
The smells.

818
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:02,391
That's a wonton wonderland!

819
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,437
Yeah!

820
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:10,608
Paul!

821
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:11,609
Paul!

822
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:12,276
Focus!

823
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:13,820
This city is the most

824
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,987
basic place I've ever seen!

825
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:17,240
I used to feel the same way until the

826
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,991
chameleon got her closet to it.

827
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:31,712
Tonight we take down the chameleon.

828
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:32,547
Oh yeah.

829
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,340
I'll show you where this villainous

830
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,424
sorceress lurks as

831
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:36,759
she dominates the city.

832
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:37,552
She lurking in that

833
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,178
villainous tower dominating the sea?

834
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:41,931
How'd you know?

835
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,099
Eh, not my first time

836
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:43,975
taking down a villain.

837
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,268
Let's keep moving.

838
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,018
Hey, Jen!

839
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:46,686
Hey Jen!

840
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:47,562
What kind of sea?

841
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,521
How you doing Jen?

842
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,606
Wow, you're quite the local celeb.

843
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:51,524
Yeah, I will.

844
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:52,984
Let's just say a face like

845
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:53,943
mine is harder to forget.

846
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:56,946
What?

847
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,739
You're a wanted criminal?

848
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,616
You sound surprised. Is it surprising?

849
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,285
I don't think this is surprising.

850
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,828
You never mentioned you were wanted.

851
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,079
Don't worry.

852
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,330
The law has better

853
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,707
things to do than look for me.

854
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,917
Hey, Fox. We've been looking for you.

855
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:11,502
Must be slow work week.

856
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:11,961
I'll handle this.

857
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,381
Morning officers. Dragon Warrior here.

858
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,841
The Fox and I are here on

859
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,968
official Dragon Warrior biz.

860
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:20,344
Dragon Who warrior?

861
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:20,887
What?

862
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,555
Dragon Warrior. Anyone?

863
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:23,639
Nothing?

864
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,142
Perhaps you know me better as...

865
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,394
The Time-boo Panda!

866
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,814
Wait, wait!

867
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,358
Oh my God.

868
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,234
Ah, come on!

869
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,278
Okay. So we tried it your way.

870
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:38,613
Now we try to time it.

871
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,157
Wait, what's your plan?

872
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:45,453
Sorry.

873
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,457
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

874
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,791
You can't run away from the

875
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:51,918
law. You're a wanted criminal.

876
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,044
Yeah, well, it looks

877
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,712
like I'm not the only one.

878
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:56,714
City Light really is fast-paced.

879
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,132
We gotta get out of here

880
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:58,883
before they call for...

881
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,094
Back up.

882
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:07,975
That's a lot of bull.

883
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:08,935
Run!

884
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:16,984
Let's go, let's go!

885
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:46,931
Yeah!

886
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:56,232
Let's go!

887
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:03,406
We're going!

888
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:04,824
We're going!

889
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:05,241
We're going!

890
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,493
We're going!

891
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,008
Sorry.

892
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,188
We're going!

893
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:47,908
Hey, hey, hey!

894
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,120
We don't have time for a truck so long!

895
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:53,831
We're trapped!

896
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,753
Hey!

897
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,928
It isn't much farther now.

898
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:08,846
You always see that

899
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,222
guy's always so much farther.

900
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,102
What is this place?

901
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:16,729
Home, sweet home.

902
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:18,814
Some of the best crooks and criminals in

903
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,691
all of Juniper City live here.

904
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,028
Careful. These guys will steal your pants

905
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,196
right out here and you'll never know.

906
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,867
Uh-oh.

907
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,160
Now you kids be

908
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:31,994
careful of those fireworks.

909
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:43,506
[screaming]

910
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:43,756
Wow!

911
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:53,766
So you're friends with all these people?

912
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,226
They're practically family.

913
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:55,935
Zinn!

914
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:02,983
Is that really you?

915
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:05,444
Ah, my old mentor.

916
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,822
I always knew someday you'll find your

917
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:08,781
way home back to the dead.

918
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,202
And when you did, I'd be sure to give you

919
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,829
a proper homecoming.

920
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,330
Family, huh?

921
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,331
More like distant cousins.

922
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,166
Alright, how should we do this?

923
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:22,628
Quick and painless or slow and painful?

924
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:23,754
Slow and painful!

925
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:25,464
Slow and painful!

926
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:26,841
Alright, you little scamps.

927
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,634
Slow and painful it is.

928
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:29,343
Yay!

929
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,929
You really don't want to do this.

930
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:31,971
And why's that?

931
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:34,849
Because if you so much as lay one claw on

932
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,308
me, you're going to have to answer to...

933
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,727
The Dragon Warrior.

934
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:42,022
Warrior, warrior, warrior, warrior.

935
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:43,732
Who?

936
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,778
Oh man, are my

937
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,155
adventures really that regional?

938
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,781
Introduce them, Bo.

939
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,659
To your fists!

940
00:40:54,451 --> 00:40:54,660
Bo)

941
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,125
Remember, Po, there are other ways to

942
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,751
break peace than by kicking butt.

943
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:04,795
Oh, come on, really? Now?

944
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,672
Yes. Now.

945
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,507
Hold on. Shouldn't my inner

946
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:09,967
sheafoos have differing opinions?

947
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:11,552
We are in total agreement

948
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,053
with our mutual disappointment.

949
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:14,221
And you...

950
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:17,099
Wait!

951
00:41:18,475 --> 00:41:21,520
He who resorts to violence now...

952
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:26,275
Will only find more violence later.

953
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,905
So what we're saying is, if we don't hurt

954
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,990
her a little now, we

955
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,366
can hurt her a lot later.

956
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,202
What? No, that's not what I said.

957
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:39,079
Yes! If more violence later, it's better

958
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,706
than less violence now.

959
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:41,707
No, no, no, no. I think you're

960
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,334
misunderstanding the fundamental point.

961
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,251
No, why? Why?

962
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:44,960
Why do you think it's

963
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,420
like my tummy jingle?

964
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:47,796
You know, that pantomie

965
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:48,839
is a lot of good points.

966
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:48,964
I like it.

967
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:54,386
No, no, no, wait! Come back!

968
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,180
I'll come up with better wisdom.

969
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:59,183
You have got to workshop those proverbs.

970
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,519
The Kung Fu Panda?

971
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:03,062
Nope.

972
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:04,980
The son of Mr. Ping and Lee?

973
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,899
No, so both very common names.

974
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,400
Mentored by Oogway?

975
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:08,609
Sorry.

976
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,402
Trained to my master Shifu?

977
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:11,904
Oh, Master Shifu!

978
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:14,240
Yes! Everyone's heard of the legendary

979
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,991
Master Shifu, but not you.

980
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:20,037
Can someone say legendary? Bring it in.

981
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,499
Look, Han, I know we've had our

982
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,376
differences, but we're really in a jam

983
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,502
here, and I was hoping

984
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:27,503
you could help me out.

985
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:27,920
Thank you.

986
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:28,837
Don't drink that.

987
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:36,553
We just need some place to lie low for a

988
00:42:36,553 --> 00:42:37,930
while until the heat cools up.

989
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,265
And why should I help you?

990
00:42:39,556 --> 00:42:40,766
Because deep down beneath that

991
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,893
iron-scaled exterior is a good-hearted

992
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,144
soul who still thinks of

993
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,020
me as one of the family.

994
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:49,149
Fine. But if he's still who by nightfall,

995
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,110
I'm calling the both myself.

996
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:52,861
Stay tight!

997
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,493
So tonight we take down the chameleon.

998
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:00,577
After you take your pants back.

999
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,454
Yeah, cool!

1000
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,957
Guys, come on! Give them back!

1001
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,041
Who's your custom?

1002
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:06,834
Please!

1003
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:10,421
[Laughter]

1004
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:14,800
Yeah, this place

1005
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,010
doesn't look very friendly.

1006
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,220
Oh, oh, wait here!

1007
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,599
I'm sure everything is fine.

1008
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:23,892
This is a restaurant!

1009
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:25,519
These are my people.

1010
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:26,937
We speak the same language!

1011
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:27,980
You wait here.

1012
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:31,859
Salutations!

1013
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,403
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

1014
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,363
I know you're having a good time.

1015
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,283
But I was wondering if a panda happened

1016
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,327
to be passing by these parts.

1017
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,162
There was a panda here.

1018
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:44,872
Do you know him?

1019
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,583
Know him? Why, I'm a stan!

1020
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:54,340
You need to pay for what

1021
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,008
your son did to my tavern!

1022
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:01,847
My boy wouldn't have

1023
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,390
done this for no reason.

1024
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,643
Is it possible you're brought with plan?

1025
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:06,769
Try it!

1026
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,396
No, no!

1027
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,732
The broth smells excellent!

1028
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,901
You should not add a single thing,

1029
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,069
especially the nothing!

1030
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,321
Hands off the goose!

1031
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,117
The panda's back!

1032
00:44:22,659 --> 00:44:23,118
He's back!

1033
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:23,994
No.

1034
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:24,286
No.

1035
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:28,499
But you're about to wish he was.

1036
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:29,917
Because if you think he

1037
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,126
made a mess of this place,

1038
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,962
you have no idea what I'm capable of.

1039
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:35,339
Everything he

1040
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,257
learned, he learned from me.

1041
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,428
Except one thing.

1042
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:42,846
Mercy.

1043
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,432
I don't know where he got

1044
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,601
that because I don't believe him.

1045
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,980
Now this can go one of two ways.

1046
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:55,067
The easy way, in which

1047
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,610
you tell me where he is,

1048
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:58,821
or the hard way, in which

1049
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,739
you tell me where he is.

1050
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,574
But it's hard to understand what you're

1051
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:04,326
saying because you have no idea.

1052
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:12,751
Maja!

1053
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,796
I eat Maja on tiles for purpose!

1054
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:22,219
Mm.

1055
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,933
Shida, sha--

1056
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:55,043
(screaming)

1057
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:59,465
- It is our son.

1058
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,216
- He took a boat in Juniper City.

1059
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,050
- It's right.

1060
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,596
- You know a wise goose.

1061
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:06,680
- Time to go.

1062
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:07,931
- Yeah, right.

1063
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:12,603
(screaming)

1064
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:25,449
(screaming)

1065
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:40,923
- Okay, let's try this again.

1066
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:42,966
- Through the pot, roll

1067
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,760
the wok, serve the dish,

1068
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:45,469
and survive.

1069
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:49,181
Hey, where's the golden dragon I'm

1070
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:49,848
supposed to shoot at?

1071
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,517
- Not gonna happen with the broom.

1072
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:52,851
- Yeah, still not bad though.

1073
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:55,812
- Yeah, but stir later, roll higher,

1074
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:57,648
and the word is sk-boosh.

1075
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,566
- Sk-boosh isn't a word.

1076
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,068
- And sk-blam is?

1077
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,364
(screaming)

1078
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:15,040
- I gotta say, you're not

1079
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,375
like any of the other masters

1080
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:16,875
I've met.

1081
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:19,086
- Yeah, no, there's not a lot of pandas.

1082
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:21,630
- No, you're like a good guy.

1083
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:25,425
- Listen up, the coast is clear, see?

1084
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,678
Hit the streets, and you

1085
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,555
two get out of my sight.

1086
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:34,560
(eerie music)

1087
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:51,952
- I know, I promise

1088
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:52,744
that I'll lead you right

1089
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,079
to the chameleon's front door,

1090
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,789
but the back door seems

1091
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:56,623
a little more practical.

1092
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:59,001
- I gotta say, Jen, you

1093
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,711
really are a fox of your word.

1094
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,046
- A Judah peach pit?

1095
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,590
- One from Master Oogway's

1096
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,174
peach tree of heavenly wisdom.

1097
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,052
That's a valley of peace thing.

1098
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,680
It's supposed to remind me that every pit

1099
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,724
holds the promise of a mighty tree.

1100
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:16,893
Maybe it'll do the same for you.

1101
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:22,441
(eerie music)

1102
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:25,611
- Are you sure you wanna do this?

1103
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:28,113
- The wise spiritual leader once said,

1104
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,950
"How may one kick butt if one doesn't

1105
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,493
seek a butt to kick?"

1106
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,830
- You're a real piece

1107
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:37,664
of work, you know that?

1108
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:38,707
- Thank you.

1109
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,543
Wait, was that a compliment by himself?

1110
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:42,336
- Yes.

1111
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:45,380
(eerie music)

1112
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,553
(eerie music)

1113
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:52,304
- Oh.

1114
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:57,059
- Ah, ah, ah, have you seen our son?

1115
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:00,979
(giggling)

1116
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:02,773
Ah, ah, ah.

1117
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,566
- Sorry.

1118
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:05,859
- Sorry, sorry.

1119
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:06,318
- No.

1120
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,612
- Tell us you've seen our son.

1121
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:09,946
(giggling)

1122
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:12,532
- Wait, why did he leave it?

1123
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:13,325
He said yes.

1124
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,496
Hey, look, Paul was here.

1125
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,915
Amazing, Dean, but how can you tell?

1126
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:21,291
- We parents have a gift

1127
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,584
for seeing, others cannot.

1128
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,169
Come on, there may be

1129
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:25,253
more clues up ahead.

1130
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:30,592
(eerie music)

1131
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:40,644
(snoring)

1132
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:41,395
- Shh.

1133
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,189
Shh.

1134
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,159
(gasping)

1135
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,703
(gasping)

1136
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:57,828
(gasping)

1137
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:19,808
(eerie music)

1138
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:27,274
(humming) (screaming)

1139
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:30,902
(screaming)

1140
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:45,333
(screaming)

1141
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:56,511
- That was close.

1142
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:57,554
- Look out.

1143
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:02,017
Paul.

1144
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:03,393
- Stand back.

1145
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,563
(screaming)

1146
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:07,689
Whoa.

1147
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:09,900
- They're coming.

1148
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:11,359
Hurry, help me with the cage.

1149
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:14,780
(screaming)

1150
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:19,618
- It's no use.

1151
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:20,994
- We gotta raise it with something.

1152
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:22,454
- Here, use my staff.

1153
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:24,456
All right, stand back, here I go.

1154
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:27,375
Jen.

1155
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,421
Where are you taking my staff?

1156
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,884
- I think you need my staff.

1157
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,928
You gave it to Jen and

1158
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,805
now Jen has given it to me.

1159
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:41,723
- Given you gain, I

1160
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,016
believe is how it looks.

1161
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:44,893
- You were right, Jen.

1162
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:46,895
She was his music mark.

1163
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:47,521
- Jen.

1164
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,439
- First roll of the streets.

1165
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:51,066
Never trust anyone.

1166
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:52,859
I thought her dead.

1167
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:54,361
- And you thought my

1168
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,695
apprentice was your friend.

1169
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:56,738
- Apprentice?

1170
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:59,282
She's the one that took you in?

1171
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,493
- Best thing that ever happened to her.

1172
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:02,536
- You should have seen

1173
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:03,620
the little better Skype

1174
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:04,704
before I found her.

1175
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,790
- Name Jean had starred.

1176
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,709
Hanging out with those

1177
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:11,461
rejects from the dead of thieves.

1178
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:28,895
(screaming)

1179
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:34,609
- She had no fear.

1180
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:37,696
Such a potential.

1181
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:45,787
So I took her in.

1182
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,749
I made her what she is today.

1183
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:51,126
Stand up straight.

1184
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,586
- Yes, master.

1185
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:54,671
So you went through all of this

1186
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:55,422
just to get me to give

1187
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,381
you the staff of wisdom?

1188
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:57,716
Why?

1189
00:52:58,216 --> 00:53:00,260
- I too paid from humble beginnings

1190
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,179
and dreamed of becoming something more.

1191
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:05,807
I wanted respect and power.

1192
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,602
I wanted to be a master of kung fu.

1193
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:09,311
- Say what?

1194
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:11,104
- I was turned away from

1195
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:13,523
every training hall I went to.

1196
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:14,649
They would say I was

1197
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:17,027
too small, too lowly,

1198
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:20,363
and that kung fu was not my destiny.

1199
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:23,241
And so I chose a different path.

1200
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:25,076
Socially.

1201
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:26,536
I grew.

1202
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:28,955
I excelled.

1203
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:30,665
And I got everything

1204
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:32,167
I had ever dreamed of.

1205
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:35,128
Everything except kung fu.

1206
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:36,212
(screaming)

1207
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:38,256
Just because I can look like Tai Lung

1208
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:39,966
doesn't mean I can fight my king.

1209
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:43,637
- You see, poo, kung fu

1210
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,555
may be performed by the body,

1211
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:48,224
but if she puts a house in the spirit,

1212
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:49,935
and now that I have

1213
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:51,394
access to the spirit realm,

1214
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:53,772
- You're gonna steal Tai Lung's kung fu?

1215
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,815
- His and those of every master villain

1216
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:57,108
that came before me.

1217
00:53:57,525 --> 00:54:00,028
And once I do, no one will dare

1218
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:01,196
underestimate me again.

1219
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,949
You forgot about me?

1220
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:07,577
(laughing)

1221
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:08,995
- Don't bother, Po.

1222
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,288
Those balls are

1223
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:12,082
enchanted with some very old

1224
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,209
and very powerful magic.

1225
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,461
You'd need at least 10 dragon

1226
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:18,171
warriors to get through them.

1227
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:19,714
- Then I won't go through them.

1228
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,591
I'll go under them.

1229
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,552
(screaming)

1230
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:27,013
(screaming)

1231
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:27,681
(screaming)

1232
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:28,348
(screaming)

1233
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,521
(screaming)

1234
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:37,607
- I'm not frustrated

1235
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:38,775
with all sorts of reasons.

1236
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:44,948
(screaming)

1237
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:53,331
(screaming)

1238
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:54,040
(screaming)

1239
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,709
(screaming)

1240
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:55,750
(screaming)

1241
00:54:55,750 --> 00:55:07,554
(screaming) (screaming) (screaming) (screaming)

1242
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:12,642
(screaming)

1243
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:13,601
(screaming)

1244
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:14,811
(screaming)

1245
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:15,228
(screaming)

1246
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:16,229
(screaming)

1247
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:16,563
(screaming)

1248
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:17,355
- Po!

1249
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:18,273
- Jen?

1250
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,026
My staff, hand it over.

1251
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,485
- I'm so sorry I lied to you.

1252
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:23,862
I was just doing what I was told.

1253
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:24,821
- Apologize later.

1254
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,281
Right now I have to stop the chameleon.

1255
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:26,865
- Po! - Po!

1256
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:27,741
- Po!

1257
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:29,034
- Jen?

1258
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:32,787
(gasping)

1259
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:34,706
(screaming)

1260
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:35,081
- No!

1261
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:43,798
- Well done, Jen.

1262
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:45,759
- You never said you were gonna hurt him.

1263
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,094
- Watch the second rule of the streets.

1264
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:50,847
- Someone always gets hurt.

1265
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:53,016
- And make sure it's never you.

1266
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,936
- I just wish there had been another way.

1267
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:58,313
- Third rule of the streets?

1268
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:00,023
- Third rule?

1269
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,609
- Some would say it's the most important.

1270
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:06,279
No one is interested in your feelings.

1271
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:09,449
- Chop, chop.

1272
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,159
We have a spirit round the plundered.

1273
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:13,203
- And smile.

1274
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,705
Nobody likes a grouch.

1275
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:17,874
- Honestly, Jen, I don't know where

1276
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,292
it becomes such bad habits.

1277
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:21,795
(ominous music)

1278
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:32,263
(growling)

1279
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:33,389
- Be careful.

1280
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:38,436
- Get on me.

1281
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:46,194
- Oh God!

1282
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,989
(screaming)

1283
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:56,162
- Don't save me.

1284
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:57,205
- Ah!

1285
00:56:58,414 --> 00:56:59,457
- Hi, son.

1286
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:01,876
(screaming)

1287
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:05,255
- It's okay, we got you, Po.

1288
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:06,256
We got you.

1289
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:09,717
So you followed me.

1290
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:10,885
It was his idea.

1291
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:11,386
- Ah.

1292
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,429
- Okay, okay, it was both our ideas.

1293
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:15,223
- We only followed because we love.

1294
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,141
- No.

1295
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:17,225
- You followed because

1296
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:18,268
you didn't believe in me.

1297
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:20,979
- And because we love?

1298
00:57:21,437 --> 00:57:24,315
- Well, you're right.

1299
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:26,609
I screwed up big time.

1300
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,112
I trusted the wrong person.

1301
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:30,572
I gave the staff of

1302
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:32,073
wisdom right to the chameleon.

1303
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:34,284
- Oh.

1304
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:36,077
Oh.

1305
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:40,331
That was a very big time screw up.

1306
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,044
- Only I'd listened to Master Sheath,

1307
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:46,254
who had stayed in the Valley of Peace.

1308
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,673
The chameleon wouldn't have my staff,

1309
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:49,799
and none of this would be happening.

1310
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:51,926
I was just so determined to

1311
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:53,386
keep things the way they were.

1312
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,680
- Everyone is afraid of

1313
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,557
the chameleon, even me.

1314
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:01,436
There was a time not so long ago

1315
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:03,313
when all I wanted to be

1316
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,856
was the greatest noodle chef

1317
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,065
in the Valley.

1318
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:07,775
- So what happened?

1319
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:09,611
- I became the greatest

1320
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:10,737
noodle chef in the Valley.

1321
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:11,988
- That's true.

1322
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:13,698
- But I also became a

1323
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:15,867
father, and nothing,

1324
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:18,203
nothing's ever been the same since.

1325
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:20,580
Change doesn't always

1326
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,831
have to be a bad thing.

1327
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:23,458
Why do you think I always

1328
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:24,709
change the menu at the restaurant?

1329
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,505
Because if things stay the same forever,

1330
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:31,174
sooner or later, they

1331
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,300
would lose their flavor.

1332
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:35,386
- He's right, Po.

1333
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:36,846
Since I left my village,

1334
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:38,223
I've become a bit of a warrior.

1335
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:40,391
Strong, brave.

1336
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:41,726
(laughing)

1337
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:42,352
- Oh!

1338
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:43,228
- Move it.

1339
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:44,729
This way.

1340
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,565
Get those pages up there.

1341
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,484
Come on!

1342
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:50,985
- This looks bad.

1343
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:52,570
- Really bad.

1344
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:53,613
- Move it!

1345
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:55,573
Come on!

1346
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,080
- Don't tell me you

1347
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,164
were actually starting

1348
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:05,124
to become friends with that vendor.

1349
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:05,917
- What?

1350
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,002
No, it's just--

1351
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:08,461
- When we want

1352
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:09,837
something, we must use whatever

1353
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,589
is at our disposal to get it.

1354
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:13,424
That's all that kind of was.

1355
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:15,218
- Something to use.

1356
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:18,429
Is that why you took me in?

1357
00:59:19,555 --> 00:59:21,766
So I could help you get what you wanted?

1358
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:25,478
I took you in because you were clever

1359
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:28,481
and ruthless and unsentimental, like me.

1360
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:29,857
And the day you

1361
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:31,234
stopped being those things

1362
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:33,820
is the day when, yes, you

1363
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,738
stopped being useful to me.

1364
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:38,616
So for both of us sakes, don't change.

1365
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:42,120
(dramatic music)

1366
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:48,793
- Tonight, when the blood moon rises

1367
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:50,128
to its highest point

1368
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:51,296
and the night's died,

1369
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:54,549
I will open the door to the spirit realm

1370
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:57,343
and all of its secrets will be mine!

1371
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,471
(gasping)

1372
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:04,934
Does the blood moon

1373
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,185
always rise as slowly?

1374
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,690
I seem to remember it rising faster.

1375
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:13,109
No?

1376
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:14,819
Just me?

1377
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:16,696
Hmm.

1378
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:20,033
Ugh.

1379
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:22,660
It's just for dramatic effect anyway.

1380
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:24,454
I think I'm just gonna

1381
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,414
open the spirit realm now.

1382
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:37,091
(dramatic music)

1383
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:39,510
Bring me Tyra!

1384
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:43,056
(dramatic music)

1385
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:53,316
- I love you, big fan.

1386
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:54,942
- Who are you and what are

1387
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:56,361
you doing with that staff?

1388
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,653
- This was given to me

1389
01:00:57,653 --> 01:00:59,322
by an old friend of yours.

1390
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:00,782
- The puffy panda?

1391
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:02,742
Poe might be an idiot,

1392
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:03,910
but he never really had

1393
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:06,537
a bookway staff to the likes of you.

1394
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:08,289
- Who said anything about you, willingly?

1395
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:15,421
(dramatic music)

1396
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:22,178
- Apparently I misjudged you, listened.

1397
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:25,390
Now, why have you brought me back?

1398
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:26,682
- I summoned you here so

1399
01:01:26,682 --> 01:01:27,600
that you could teach me

1400
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,769
your most legendary kung fu roots.

1401
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:32,647
- I don't share my skills with anyone.

1402
01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:34,232
- There wasn't a request.

1403
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,818
(dramatic music)

1404
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:48,538
(dramatic music)

1405
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:52,417
(dramatic music)

1406
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:52,875
(dramatic music)

1407
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:16,816
(dramatic music)

1408
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:28,369
- Yes, I got it.

1409
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:30,329
- The Tylung Nerve Strike,

1410
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:32,457
the power, the precision.

1411
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:35,668
(dramatic music)

1412
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:38,379
- What have you done to me?

1413
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,091
- All of your kung fu is now mine.

1414
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,303
And the best part is,

1415
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:47,680
I'm just getting warmed up.

1416
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,641
- Bring me General Nye.

1417
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,102
(dramatic music)

1418
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:55,980
Bring me the Stomp of the Spring.

1419
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,108
(dramatic music)

1420
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:00,735
(dramatic music)

1421
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:02,403
(dramatic music)

1422
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:07,867
(dramatic music)

1423
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:10,828
- Oh, why would this be reasonable?

1424
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:12,330
- I'm not going anywhere

1425
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,748
until I get my staff back.

1426
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:15,917
- No staff is worth your life.

1427
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:16,792
- As long as I'm

1428
01:03:16,792 --> 01:03:17,960
still the Dragon Warrior,

1429
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:19,462
I won't let anyone else

1430
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:20,630
get hurt because of me.

1431
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,883
(dramatic music)

1432
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:31,140
(dramatic music)

1433
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:40,900
- Hope, you're alive.

1434
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:44,946
(dramatic music)

1435
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:46,113
Please, I made a mistake.

1436
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:48,950
- So did I, trusting you.

1437
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:50,743
- I'm sorry.

1438
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:52,203
- Did your master

1439
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:53,412
tell you to say that too?

1440
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:54,830
- She's not my master,

1441
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:56,624
I'm leaving for good.

1442
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,377
It's the truth, I was

1443
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:00,836
wrong about everything.

1444
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,799
- What are you doing?

1445
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:06,092
- Stop it, you.

1446
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,219
- Get out of my way, Jen.

1447
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:09,220
- No.

1448
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:11,264
- Move.

1449
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:12,557
- You want me to move?

1450
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:13,975
- Move me.

1451
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:15,810
- First you betrayed me,

1452
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:16,894
and now you wanna fight me?

1453
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:18,479
(dramatic music)

1454
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:19,939
Why are you doing this?

1455
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,608
- To stop you from getting killed.

1456
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:24,944
(dramatic music)

1457
01:04:26,487 --> 01:04:36,205
(dramatic music)

1458
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:52,305
- What do you care if

1459
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,306
I get killed or not?

1460
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:59,979
(dramatic music)

1461
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:11,824
- Please, Pope, just

1462
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:13,618
something to do with one thing right.

1463
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:19,999
- You're not the only one

1464
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:21,584
who's made some bad choices lately.

1465
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:24,670
- You're really gonna go

1466
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:25,504
through with this, aren't you?

1467
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:26,881
- Afraid so.

1468
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:29,008
- And there's nothing I

1469
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:30,134
can do to talk you out of it?

1470
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:31,135
- I'm afraid not.

1471
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:33,179
- You can't beat her, you know?

1472
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:34,639
- You're probably

1473
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:37,516
right, but I have to try.

1474
01:05:39,852 --> 01:05:40,603
Get as far away from

1475
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:41,646
this place as you can.

1476
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:42,396
- How?

1477
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:45,066
We should never have let him come here.

1478
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:46,692
We are such a terrible father.

1479
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:49,487
- At least you didn't lie and betray him.

1480
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:51,322
- Well, that's true, you're worse.

1481
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:53,574
- I am a terrible friend.

1482
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:55,368
- A friend, I feel a

1483
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:56,702
little generous, not about us.

1484
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:58,663
- Let's just give up, surrender.

1485
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:00,331
- We can't let him go in there alone.

1486
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:01,791
- What can we do?

1487
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:02,917
- There's just three

1488
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:04,168
of us against an army.

1489
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:05,795
- Then I guess we'll just

1490
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,213
have to get an army of our own.

1491
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:12,134
(dramatic music)

1492
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:16,806
(screaming)

1493
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:22,311
- Hey, lift me up, everybody.

1494
01:06:23,187 --> 01:06:25,356
(dramatic music)

1495
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:29,318
(screaming)

1496
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:32,405
- Thank you.

1497
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:34,407
The Dragon Warrior's in trouble.

1498
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:36,200
- Who?

1499
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:37,952
- You know, Bo.

1500
01:06:39,745 --> 01:06:40,121
The Panda.

1501
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:45,751
Now, now, a different Panda.

1502
01:06:46,001 --> 01:06:46,544
- I'm his father.

1503
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:48,045
- I'm also his father.

1504
01:06:49,046 --> 01:06:50,172
Okay, that doesn't matter.

1505
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:52,007
What matters is that

1506
01:06:52,007 --> 01:06:52,925
my friend's in trouble

1507
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:53,968
and he needs my help.

1508
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:55,886
So, I need yours.

1509
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:56,303
- Why?

1510
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:57,471
- Should we help you?

1511
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:01,434
- Because, because it's

1512
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:03,018
the right thing to do.

1513
01:07:06,021 --> 01:07:06,439
(screaming)

1514
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:10,151
- Stop it, stop, stop laughing.

1515
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:14,196
I know you think it might be too late

1516
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:15,364
for a bunch of cheats,

1517
01:07:15,906 --> 01:07:17,366
thieves, and cutthroats like us

1518
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:19,785
to change our ways, but a

1519
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:21,203
good friend once told me

1520
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:22,580
it's never too late

1521
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:23,998
to do the right thing.

1522
01:07:24,665 --> 01:07:26,208
So, what you're saying is,

1523
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:27,626
the more right we do now,

1524
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:29,795
the more wrong we can do later.

1525
01:07:30,045 --> 01:07:31,046
- But, no.

1526
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:33,340
- And with the communion out of the way.

1527
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:34,550
- We can finally do

1528
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:35,593
all the wrong we want.

1529
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:36,635
- I think you're

1530
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:38,053
missing the fundamental point.

1531
01:07:38,637 --> 01:07:40,598
- Violence, violence, violence.

1532
01:07:40,765 --> 01:07:41,807
- Are you guys ready

1533
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:43,058
to do the right thing

1534
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:44,393
for the wrong reasons?

1535
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:46,103
(screaming)

1536
01:07:47,104 --> 01:07:48,397
(screaming)

1537
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:51,150
- Now, you see the mistake

1538
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,443
this dragon warrior fellow made

1539
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:53,986
was underestimating his opponent.

1540
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:55,404
- I never would have walked

1541
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:56,864
into such an obvious trap.

1542
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:57,531
- Hey.

1543
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:02,828
- Now, you see the mistake

1544
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:04,079
this dragon warrior fellow made

1545
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:05,331
was shut up, Barry.

1546
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:12,171
- This place is growing with more guards

1547
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:12,963
than I've ever seen.

1548
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:15,007
I'll never get to Paul in time.

1549
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:16,550
- You just get to Paul.

1550
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:17,551
- He'll take care of the guards.

1551
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:18,594
- We will?

1552
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:20,721
I mean, we will.

1553
01:08:21,138 --> 01:08:21,847
- But how?

1554
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:24,391
- Just leave that to me.

1555
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:32,316
(dramatic music)

1556
01:08:32,316 --> 01:08:35,986
(screaming)

1557
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:48,999
(dramatic music)

1558
01:08:48,999 --> 01:08:59,301
- General Kine, Lord Shep,

1559
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:00,761
those are all my old

1560
01:09:00,761 --> 01:09:03,305
nemesis' nemacy, nemacy?

1561
01:09:03,764 --> 01:09:05,099
- The chameleon is pulling

1562
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:06,684
spirits from the spirit realm

1563
01:09:07,017 --> 01:09:08,811
and draining us of all our moves.

1564
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:11,522
- And she's using your staff to do it.

1565
01:09:12,022 --> 01:09:13,274
- I'm here to get it back.

1566
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:15,150
- I won't hold my breath.

1567
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:16,944
- I'm sorry, do I know you?

1568
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:17,820
- Do you know me?

1569
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:18,779
It's Scott.

1570
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:22,408
The fire-breathing crocodile.

1571
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:24,660
- Oh, right, Scott.

1572
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:26,954
Master Shifu and I were

1573
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:28,038
just talking about you.

1574
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:31,709
- And who made a mistake

1575
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:33,586
choosing you as the dragon warrior?

1576
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:36,505
I just didn't realize how

1577
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:39,300
big a mistake it was until now.

1578
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:41,302
- Whoa, Tai Lung?

1579
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:43,095
I'm gonna get that staff

1580
01:09:43,095 --> 01:09:45,180
back, restore your kung fu,

1581
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:46,724
and return you all

1582
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:47,933
back to the spirit realm.

1583
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,603
You'll see, all I see

1584
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:53,063
is a broken promise.

1585
01:09:55,983 --> 01:09:57,902
(dramatic music)

1586
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:01,363
- All right, you bunch

1587
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:03,532
of cantankerous kamodos.

1588
01:10:03,824 --> 01:10:06,327
Now this can go one of two ways.

1589
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:08,787
The easy way in which

1590
01:10:08,787 --> 01:10:10,789
you surrender willingly,

1591
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:12,458
or the hard way where

1592
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:14,668
you surrender woundedly.

1593
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:17,338
The choice is yours.

1594
01:10:21,967 --> 01:10:23,844
(dramatic music) - I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.

1595
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:33,562
(screaming) - Oh.

1596
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:37,775
(growling)

1597
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:38,484
(screaming)

1598
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:41,195
- I've been.

1599
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:47,701
(screaming)

1600
01:10:47,701 --> 01:10:52,873
- I can't help.

1601
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:04,218
- Is it too spicy?

1602
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:06,178
- No, it's got the perfect.

1603
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,138
- I can't send a death

1604
01:11:08,138 --> 01:11:10,140
suit to my mouth every time.

1605
01:11:11,141 --> 01:11:12,393
(screaming)

1606
01:11:15,062 --> 01:11:16,855
(laughing)

1607
01:11:16,855 --> 01:11:18,857
- That scandal is right,

1608
01:11:18,857 --> 01:11:20,818
more violence later is better.

1609
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:22,277
(cheering)

1610
01:11:22,277 --> 01:11:29,618
- I believe you have

1611
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:31,328
something that belongs to me.

1612
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:36,875
- Can't you even die right?

1613
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:38,419
- Can't you even kill wrong?

1614
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:40,587
- Nope, we're playing

1615
01:11:40,587 --> 01:11:41,547
it and coming together.

1616
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:42,673
Now about that staff.

1617
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:47,678
- Take it, I already have everything I

1618
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:48,470
need from it anyway.

1619
01:11:49,596 --> 01:11:51,473
I think this was destiny.

1620
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:53,559
A final face off

1621
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:55,811
between the new adversaries,

1622
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,439
alike in so many ways.

1623
01:11:58,689 --> 01:11:59,481
- If only I had a

1624
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:00,691
jumpling for every time a villain

1625
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:02,151
told me how much we had in common.

1626
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:03,944
- It's true, we've both

1627
01:12:03,944 --> 01:12:05,362
risen to the highest of heights.

1628
01:12:05,779 --> 01:12:07,281
It's a shame only one of

1629
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:08,782
us can come out on top.

1630
01:12:08,782 --> 01:12:10,826
- It is a shame, for you.

1631
01:12:11,618 --> 01:12:14,538
- My combined power, sorcery and control

1632
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:16,081
make me unstoppable.

1633
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:18,000
And once I dispense with you,

1634
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,293
I'll expand my rule

1635
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:20,711
from Juniper City to--

1636
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:22,588
- Every other city and town and village

1637
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:23,255
from here to the

1638
01:12:23,255 --> 01:12:24,465
valley of peace and beyond.

1639
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:25,257
Yeah, I know.

1640
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:27,176
- But how did you know?

1641
01:12:27,718 --> 01:12:28,886
- I saw it in a vision,

1642
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:30,971
because I'm the track and warrior.

1643
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:34,558
For now at least.

1644
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:36,852
But I've realized that it's

1645
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:38,270
probably time I made a change.

1646
01:12:39,813 --> 01:12:40,606
And so should you.

1647
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,191
I'm the chameleon, I

1648
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:43,442
do nothing but change.

1649
01:12:43,942 --> 01:12:45,152
- Only on the outside.

1650
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:47,529
Real change happens from within.

1651
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:50,032
And if we're really as alike as you say,

1652
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:51,492
then maybe we could

1653
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:52,785
both let go of who we were

1654
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:53,452
and become something

1655
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:54,828
better than we already are.

1656
01:12:56,246 --> 01:12:56,747
What do you say?

1657
01:12:57,372 --> 01:12:58,248
- I say--

1658
01:12:59,416 --> 01:12:59,833
(dramatic music)

1659
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:02,377
- I saw that coming.

1660
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:06,215
We're very proud of you.

1661
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:07,549
You climbed it our way.

1662
01:13:08,008 --> 01:13:09,343
Now, try it yours.

1663
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:11,428
- Take her butt.

1664
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:13,514
- I'm way ahead of you.

1665
01:13:21,855 --> 01:13:23,357
- That's a hell of a strong twist.

1666
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:28,862
- Master Force, push some terror.

1667
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:31,990
Master Force, make some fury.

1668
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:34,159
(screaming)

1669
01:13:35,035 --> 01:13:36,662
(screaming)

1670
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:38,747
Master Force, pour some gold.

1671
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:41,458
(dramatic music)

1672
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:42,084
- What?

1673
01:13:42,709 --> 01:13:43,919
- Recognize this move?

1674
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:45,295
(screaming)

1675
01:13:45,295 --> 01:13:47,631
- Is that how I sound?

1676
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:49,591
I don't sound like that, do I?

1677
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:50,843
- You didn't hear the light, I almost--

1678
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:52,177
I just fell off.

1679
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:53,679
I can't come down.

1680
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:54,179
- You know what left?

1681
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:55,389
All right, Alpha Kai,

1682
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:56,265
which one are you rooting for?

1683
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:56,932
- I'm not sure.

1684
01:13:57,141 --> 01:13:58,517
This is all very confusing.

1685
01:13:58,809 --> 01:14:00,102
I'm stronger than every

1686
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:01,353
opponent you've ever faced.

1687
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:03,147
Because I am every

1688
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:04,439
opponent you've ever faced.

1689
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:08,861
(screaming)

1690
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:19,621
- Whoa, I gotta workshop

1691
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:20,914
those heroic entrances.

1692
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:22,749
- Nah, it was just right.

1693
01:14:25,335 --> 01:14:26,962
- I wish we had to do rotten

1694
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:28,172
and gutter where you belong.

1695
01:14:28,463 --> 01:14:29,256
- Better to rot in the

1696
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:30,382
gutter than under your thumb.

1697
01:14:31,675 --> 01:14:31,842
(grunting)

1698
01:14:34,761 --> 01:14:38,473
(dramatic music)

1699
01:14:39,349 --> 01:14:39,641
- Yeah!

1700
01:14:39,766 --> 01:14:40,642
- Who against one?

1701
01:14:41,059 --> 01:14:43,020
- Well, now, that doesn't seem fair.

1702
01:14:43,395 --> 01:14:44,897
I'll have to even the odds.

1703
01:14:47,232 --> 01:14:49,526
- Master Cobra, Master

1704
01:14:49,526 --> 01:14:52,738
Osprey, Master Scooby-O.

1705
01:14:53,405 --> 01:14:56,366
Master Moon, General Kai, Lord Shag.

1706
01:14:56,408 --> 01:14:58,118
- No, Lord Shag.

1707
01:14:59,536 --> 01:15:05,042
- That is awesome.

1708
01:15:06,543 --> 01:15:07,336
I mean, it's

1709
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:08,629
disturbing, but it's awesome.

1710
01:15:11,423 --> 01:15:36,490
(roaring) - Whoa!

1711
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:38,075
(screaming)

1712
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:42,287
(screaming)

1713
01:15:42,287 --> 01:15:59,972
(screaming) (screaming)

1714
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:04,101
- How?

1715
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:09,231
(laughing)

1716
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:13,026
- I thought we were friends.

1717
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:18,240
Stand back, I'm gonna kick my butt.

1718
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:29,167
(dramatic music)

1719
01:16:56,403 --> 01:17:04,661
(screaming)

1720
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:30,354
(screaming) (dramatic music)

1721
01:17:30,354 --> 01:17:41,656
- Come on, Paul, get out of there.

1722
01:17:41,656 --> 01:17:42,657
- You have to do this.

1723
01:17:42,657 --> 01:17:44,159
- I can't beat the chameleon.

1724
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:45,744
- A wise old tortoise once told me

1725
01:17:45,744 --> 01:17:46,536
that you never know what

1726
01:17:46,536 --> 01:17:47,829
you can do until you do it.

1727
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:48,705
- The fate of the

1728
01:17:48,705 --> 01:17:50,040
world hangs in the balance

1729
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:50,957
and you're here giving me

1730
01:17:50,957 --> 01:17:52,167
life advice on a tortoise.

1731
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:53,794
- Be the pit, Jen.

1732
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:55,545
Be the pit.

1733
01:17:56,421 --> 01:18:03,303
(dramatic music)

1734
01:18:03,303 --> 01:18:07,599
- And what do you think you're doing?

1735
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:09,393
- Finishing what Paul started.

1736
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:10,018
- Oh, please.

1737
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,062
How many times do I have to tell you?

1738
01:18:12,979 --> 01:18:14,106
(screaming)

1739
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:15,273
- Don't say much.

1740
01:18:17,609 --> 01:18:18,026
(dramatic music)

1741
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:22,197
(grunting)

1742
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:27,577
- You ungrateful little person.

1743
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:29,371
That's all I've done for you.

1744
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:31,498
You betrayed me for the panda.

1745
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:34,042
- Yours for all his truth.

1746
01:18:34,918 --> 01:18:36,461
Never trust anyone.

1747
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:38,588
- You can't defeat me.

1748
01:18:38,588 --> 01:18:39,881
I know all your moves.

1749
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:41,258
- Not this one.

1750
01:18:42,008 --> 01:18:43,719
- Roll, I have stirred,

1751
01:18:44,469 --> 01:18:46,721
served, and stunk lamb.

1752
01:18:48,473 --> 01:18:48,849
(dramatic music)

1753
01:18:50,851 --> 01:18:54,020
(screaming)

1754
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:57,774
- Second roll, someone always gets hurt.

1755
01:18:58,483 --> 01:19:00,110
- Now that's a cool move.

1756
01:19:00,735 --> 01:19:01,611
- Paul, you could've

1757
01:19:01,611 --> 01:19:02,320
gotten out of that cage

1758
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,071
any time you wanted.

1759
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:03,989
- You faker.

1760
01:19:04,364 --> 01:19:05,949
- It's not faking, it's method.

1761
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,034
Besides, how's a peach pit

1762
01:19:08,034 --> 01:19:09,327
ever supposed to become a tree

1763
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:11,538
if you never give it the chance to grow?

1764
01:19:14,499 --> 01:19:15,667
- Hey, you stirred

1765
01:19:15,667 --> 01:19:17,127
faster and rolled higher.

1766
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:20,172
But for the last time, the word is...

1767
01:19:20,213 --> 01:19:24,176
(grunting)

1768
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:27,179
(grunting)

1769
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:53,163
(dramatic music)

1770
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:56,374
- Maybe your way was right about you.

1771
01:19:59,419 --> 01:20:01,171
You are completely useless, actual.

1772
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:03,757
- Oh my gosh, thank you so much.

1773
01:20:05,717 --> 01:20:10,972
(dramatic music)

1774
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:15,352
(laughing)

1775
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:17,562
- I'm done, I'm done.

1776
01:20:19,022 --> 01:20:22,901
I think it's time to send us home, pal.

1777
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:25,779
(dramatic music)

1778
01:20:48,051 --> 01:20:56,059
(dramatic music)

1779
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:58,853
- Jen, do something!

1780
01:20:59,771 --> 01:21:01,898
- Third roll, no one's

1781
01:21:01,898 --> 01:21:02,941
interested in your feelings.

1782
01:21:06,945 --> 01:21:09,489
- I see you on the other side.

1783
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:11,491
Dragon Warrior.

1784
01:21:12,158 --> 01:21:12,826
(screaming)

1785
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:22,794
(dramatic music)

1786
01:21:22,794 --> 01:21:35,265
- Put back some food

1787
01:21:35,265 --> 01:21:36,391
for your time in jail.

1788
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:38,893
- Let's hope it's not your final meal.

1789
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:40,478
- Thanks, guys.

1790
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:44,357
I was thinking, after I serve my time

1791
01:21:44,357 --> 01:21:45,859
and I'm a free fox again,

1792
01:21:46,484 --> 01:21:47,277
maybe I'll open one of

1793
01:21:47,277 --> 01:21:48,445
those acupuncture places

1794
01:21:48,445 --> 01:21:49,362
that are all the rage.

1795
01:21:49,362 --> 01:21:50,989
- I think you better sit it for a job

1796
01:21:51,364 --> 01:21:53,450
with a little more room for growth.

1797
01:21:55,493 --> 01:21:56,953
(dramatic music)

1798
01:21:57,954 --> 01:21:58,455
- Key balance.

1799
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:01,458
(blowing raspberry)

1800
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:03,084
- Oh, out of all the

1801
01:22:03,084 --> 01:22:04,044
candidates you choose

1802
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:05,712
to train as your worthy successor,

1803
01:22:06,212 --> 01:22:07,380
you chose the fox.

1804
01:22:07,922 --> 01:22:09,758
You know when you know, you know?

1805
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:11,051
- Fine, do what you

1806
01:22:11,051 --> 01:22:12,218
want, for me, for state,

1807
01:22:12,218 --> 01:22:12,927
for carrot, I don't

1808
01:22:12,927 --> 01:22:14,054
even know why I bothered.

1809
01:22:14,387 --> 01:22:15,388
- I'm going to meditate.

1810
01:22:15,972 --> 01:22:16,598
- A what?

1811
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:21,019
- Don't worry, he'll come around.

1812
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:22,354
Probably.

1813
01:22:23,396 --> 01:22:23,730
- Maybe.

1814
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:27,108
- Hey, you okay?

1815
01:22:29,402 --> 01:22:30,695
- He's right, what about

1816
01:22:30,695 --> 01:22:31,780
me says I'm ready for this?

1817
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:34,157
- Well, as I learned from

1818
01:22:34,157 --> 01:22:35,283
working in my dad's kitchen,

1819
01:22:35,659 --> 01:22:37,243
sometimes the greatest dishes

1820
01:22:37,827 --> 01:22:39,537
come from the most unlikely ingredients.

1821
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:41,956
- Hey, that's not bad.

1822
01:22:42,248 --> 01:22:43,667
Okay, I see you as spiritual leader.

1823
01:22:43,958 --> 01:22:45,210
- Yeah, I'm getting the

1824
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:46,503
hang of this proverb thing.

1825
01:22:46,878 --> 01:22:48,380
One shouldn't do a deep squat

1826
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:49,964
with a chopstick in one's pocket.

1827
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:51,049
- Yeah, maybe you just

1828
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:51,883
stick the cake in mine.

1829
01:22:51,883 --> 01:22:53,093
- Money can't buy happiness.

1830
01:22:53,593 --> 01:22:55,345
- But it sure can buy a lot of dumplings.

1831
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:56,638
- Why does it always come

1832
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:57,972
back to dumplings with you?

1833
01:22:57,972 --> 01:22:59,265
- When life gives you lemons,

1834
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:01,059
make pear juice and

1835
01:23:01,059 --> 01:23:02,310
blow everyone's minds.

1836
01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:03,728
- We get it.

1837
01:23:03,728 --> 01:23:04,646
- You can't have your

1838
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:06,022
mooncake and eat it too.

1839
01:23:07,023 --> 01:23:07,440
- Although, I guess

1840
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:08,233
you could have mooncake

1841
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:08,733
and then the border

1842
01:23:08,733 --> 01:23:09,901
men go putting on side.

1843
01:23:10,235 --> 01:23:11,653
- Can we just start the training now?

1844
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:15,407
- Inner peace.

1845
01:23:17,117 --> 01:23:17,742
Inner peace.

1846
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:19,994
Inner peace.

1847
01:23:20,453 --> 01:23:21,454
- Hey, Master, she food.

1848
01:23:21,871 --> 01:23:22,622
- There's two of us.

1849
01:23:22,622 --> 01:23:23,707
- We're doing great, she food.

1850
01:23:23,707 --> 01:23:24,708
- We're not breathing with your belly.

1851
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:25,834
- Are you tired?

1852
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:26,876
- There's a piece you mentioned.

1853
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:27,627
- I'm tired.

1854
01:23:27,627 --> 01:23:29,671
- You know what this world is about.

1855
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:29,879
- You know what this world is about.

1856
01:23:31,005 --> 01:23:31,214
- Aah!

1857
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:36,052
- Inner peace.

1858
01:23:38,388 --> 01:23:39,139
Inner peace.

1859
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:42,267
Inner peace.

1860
01:23:43,935 --> 01:23:49,858
(somber music)

1861
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:52,819
- Are you ready to begin your training?

1862
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:54,237
- Are you?

1863
01:23:55,155 --> 01:23:55,697
- Yes.

1864
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:57,490
- Yeah, I brought a little help.

1865
01:23:58,491 --> 01:23:58,742
(dramatic music)

1866
