00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.840
Hi, uh, where's your bathroom?

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.760
For customers only.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.840
Oh, okay, I'll-I'll buy something.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:48.970
You gotta pay up there.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.680
Can I just go now? I really have to pee.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.860
We've got a large
cappuccino for Skylar! Thanks.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.360
Um, I also can't-
Oh, no, I-I know.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.778
The, uh, establishments that
serve food or drink must be

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.700
open to the public regardless
of their purchasing class.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.100
Sorry, it's on policy.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.120
Store policy can't really
super-scene state law.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.200
Can you get us an emergency
caramel latte from Miranda?

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.160
Uh, honey?

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.400
About to order, do you want your usual?

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.573
Uh, my wife would like a
double Espresso, although

00:01:27.585 --> 00:01:30.260
you've had trouble
sleeping lately, right babe?

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.973
Maybe we should
back it off to a single you

00:01:32.985 --> 00:01:35.380
kept the light on till
like midnight last night.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.120
I did, didn't I?

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.500
Yeah, so maybe I'll just have a
peppermint tea with two sugars.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.800
Thanks, husband.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.460
Oh, and the bread.
It's grilled cheese night.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.320
And she is part of the purchasing class, so
can we get the bathroom key? Thank you.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.240
Thank you.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.400
That was really nice.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.100
You too.

00:02:08.115 --> 00:02:09.700
You knew a lot about bathroom law.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.040
That was a short chapter.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.260
Thank you.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.900
I'll have your tea waiting for you.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.060
I can't leave my wife.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.320
Oh.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.400
Okay, that's great.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.200
I will...

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.200
see you on the other side of...

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.600
Hallie?

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.280
I just met this guy, and I
don't know what's happening.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.788
Well, I know it's been a
while, but I'm pretty sure he

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.000
bought me a tea, and I
might have just stole my coat.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.760
But what do I do?

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.040
I don't know, because it's the time
that I'm just meeting people, doing things.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.520
Hallie, I gotta look back.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.700
Go ahead. Get on my desk.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.250
Are you okay? Big time.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:42.790
Internship.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.073
And I don't want to ask him
what his bathroom was, because I

00:03:55.085 --> 00:03:57.870
don't want him to think I was a
weak and not a problem solver.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.270
Okay.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.030
And by the way, it is not
me to ask who's bathroom is.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.550
I think he went down
to this very, very normal.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.570
Peppermint tea, two sugars.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.530
Thank you.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.510
And thanks for stealing the coat.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:31.770
Oh.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.121
I... I can't.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.220
Oh, hey.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.681
Like, um, you... So, are you
gonna ask me out now? Yeah.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.640
Yeah, I am.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.100
I'm back.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.140
I'm being.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.140
You're right, you're right, you're right.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.900
That's, like, five years.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.620
I feel like this place will be...

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.740
Six place.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Yes.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.140
Gotta ruin it.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.920
I'm impressed.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.480
I can really get to ruin it.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.590
All right, we have to cool down. You
just saw me take it off the burning stove.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:56.350
Oh, my God.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.623
If you're gonna be a
lawyer, you gotta understand

00:05:59.635 --> 00:06:03.991
negligence and breach and McDonald's
versus that lady's... hideous corpus.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.510
Use none of those terms properly.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.511
How do you know? You're not a lawyer yet.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.746
It's not too late to choose
a more noble profession.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:10.770
Oh, like you? You're right.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.231
Just take away that I'm gonna
need a lawyer at some point.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.130
I don't even know if I'm gonna be a lawyer.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.910
I cannot believe I
just said I don't have...

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.250
I'm sorry my life is a disaster right now.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.150
Mike, you turned in the corner.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:31.470
You just met me.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.781
All right, I might end up in a suitcase.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.290
I mean, look at this place.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.290
Looks like every serial killer
reenactment documentary.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:39.770
Why do you have a giant wrench?

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.630
Okay, it wouldn't be a suitcase.
It'd be a carry-on.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:44.491
Because you're zero feet tall.

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.230
And my mom gave me that.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.670
She said, no matter how broken something
is, there's always a way to fix it.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.651
I'm sorry, I don't know why I'm
talking to you about my mom right now.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.710
All right. And tell me about that.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.850
That is a long story.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:02.690
Everybody survived.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:04.350
Great.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.650
Holly, I don't know.
This guy is fucking great.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.890
No, let's go, Minnie. Come on, cupcake.
We don't need light.

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:34.210
Stop it.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.370
No way. You could.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:39.530
Why couldn't you pull me up or stay over?

00:08:40.555 --> 00:08:42.710
He asked me out, and
then I kind of asked him out.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.530
And then we just walked around
the city and we felt sick talking.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:48.390
And I left before you could wake up.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:50.050
I don't know why.

00:08:50.051 --> 00:08:51.830
Why did I?

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:53.850
What the fuck am I doing?

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.230
Okay, I love you.
I'm so sorry I woke you up.

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:59.450
This whole thing is so new to me.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:03.170
You got cheese and bread.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.070
You didn't miss one ingredient.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:06.590
What you doing with that?

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:08.490
Why you got the giant wrench?

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.100
You tell her about your mom, bro.

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:13.530
You don't tell nobody about your mom.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:15.510
Fuck, dawg.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:16.910
You in love, man.

00:09:19.385 --> 00:09:20.670
About fucking time, man.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.150
My boys in love.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.750
Fuck that.
I couldn't get her out of here fast enough.

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:26.250
This girl's a disaster.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:28.250
She said nothing.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:53.140
She said nothing.

00:09:53.141 --> 00:09:55.880
I told her, I'll let your girlfriend
scream and I'll come home.

00:10:20.825 --> 00:10:30.825
<font color="#60ff00">Subtitle made by MASTER_BLASTER for www.subscene.com</font>

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:32.690
I'll let her go home.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:39.250
There we go.

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:47.890
Halle, my new girlfriend.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:49.790
What are we saying?

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:51.510
Yeah, is that cool?

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:54.710
Yeah, I mean, I don't really like
labels, but I like you a whole bunch.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.458
I like your friend a whole
bunch, and if she wants to put

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.770
a label on me, then she can
sew it on wherever she wants.

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:01.306
That was weird. That was weird.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.330
I'm not into S&M or anything like that.

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:05.650
Unless you are, which would be
totally cool, you know? You do you.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:07.970
Well, she really likes you, too.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:10.290
And that is very rare for her.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:11.750
Oh, look who's talking.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:14.750
How's the crowd here tonight?

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:16.330
Over there, big boy.

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:23.010
You ladies like dumplings?
We just had the greatest dumplings.

00:11:23.011 --> 00:11:25.990
Pete, my sister.
This is Pete, Claudia's brother.

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:27.030
Nice to meet you.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.910
And Ben. Ben.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.510
This is Ben. We all grew up together.

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:36.110
Ready? Yeah.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.050
Did you know each
other? Yeah, we met.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:39.990
Barely.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:42.910
Wow, that's so random.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:44.410
I'm gonna go grab a drink.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:46.570
Doors that way if you're
looking to sneak out.

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:47.870
I know that's your thing.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:49.290
Well, I am a disaster.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:54.990
Let's go away from this.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:55.310
Yeah.

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:57.410
So you a lawyer yet?

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:59.450
Why? Do we need a defense attorney?

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.210
I'm just curious how you passed the
class on ethics and I'm bailing on people.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:06.430
I think that's the jerk who we got
when she was on a break from Jonathan.

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:07.830
No way.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:10.490
So he's the coffee girl who ghosted him?

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:14.270
I thought she looked familiar, but
I don't see faces. I just see souls.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.850
At least you made her realize
that Jonathan was the one.

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:17.590
I'm engaged now.

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.270
Good for you.
We're registered all the time.

00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:19.990
I'll buy you a broomstick.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:23.490
I'll send you an invite.
You still live at the 28 Buck Boy Lane?

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:26.030
You do remember.
See, it did mean something to you.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:27.910
You'll always be my rock bottom.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:29.110
The night I spent with a bitch.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.410
Is she just calling a bitch?

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:32.530
You think they're gonna
physically fight? We're back.

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:35.550
It's a fine line.

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:37.650
Let's just get through
tonight for them, okay?

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:40.630
Elle, she's your sister.
I'm sure the relationship won't last long.

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.050
She's your friend.
I question why they're even together.

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:46.290
Then I'm gonna get a drink and
toast to never seeing you again.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:47.990
Cheers to that, bro.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.020
So before I pronounce this newlywed couple,

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.000
if anyone has an issue
with these two wonderful

00:12:58.001 --> 00:13:00.040
people joining together
in holy matrimony,

00:13:00.545 --> 00:13:02.500
speak now or forever hold your peace.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.100
I have an objection.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.140
Liam, don't do this.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.780
I have to, honey. It's just not right.

00:13:08.695 --> 00:13:10.520
There's no way I can bless this union.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.860
without their friends and family
joining us to celebrate in Australia!

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.600
We're getting married in Fiji!

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.470
Welcome aboard, 2K, to the front.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:33.870
Thank you, Charlotte.

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:36.750
51E, how long's
the flight? 16 hours.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.510
51F, thank you.

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:44.070
73F, all the way to the back.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.600
Hey.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.300
Hey, to the wedding.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.620
From my sister, your slam.

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.580
How crazy is it that
we're on the same plane?

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.076
Don't think there's thousands of
flights flying to Sydney every day.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.396
Well, there's quite a few, actually.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:19.820
Qantas, American, Qantas through Dubai,

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.320
some co-chairs,

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.200
serendipity, I guess.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.616
I don't think that word means
what you think it means.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:26.260
So where's your fiancé?

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.000
Who is this at? Hey, I'm Ben.

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.580
I was her hall
pass on your break.

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:30.440
What? Oh, my God.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:32.420
I forgot.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:34.590
Claude told me you dumped him.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:37.140
Did you sneak out on your wedding day?

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:38.440
Wow, you are a child.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.716
It's a pretty long flight. Do you want
anything from the front of the boat?

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:45.000
Hot cookie, eye mask, pajamas, last
10 years of your life? No, thank you.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.720
I'm all good on creatine
and smell thick insecurity.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.480
Nothing small about me.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.400
What the fuck? A good flight.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:53.920
See you there.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.240
Why do so many of us feel stuck?

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:04.580
How is it even though it's successful?

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.440
Often feel like there is
something missing from their life.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.760
One answer to that problem,

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:21.610
many of us are needed
lives that are misaligned.

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:24.560
with our own deepest
values and preferences.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.420
Thank you so much for joining
me today on Heaven Break.

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:31.600
What psychology can teach us

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:34.340
about living our most authentic lives?

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.520
What the fuck?

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.180
Hey, Vinnie!

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:12.940
Vindello!

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:17.490
Okay, man, looking good.

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.820
Thanks for picking me up, dude.

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:21.170
Not just you, my guy.

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:22.730
Smell it, Vinnie!

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.720
Our sisters are getting married.
How dope is that?

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:27.050
I know, I'm so excited.

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:29.470
Oh, great. Alright, let's hit it.

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:42.970
See you soon.

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:47.331
You can't wait for y'all to
see when we stay in the flat.

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:48.410
It's so dope.

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:50.930
We're all staying in the same place.

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:51.670
Yeah.

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:56.390
My stepdad's super important for
them to keep the wedding party together.

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.806
Seems like a piece of information that
could have been shared a little earlier.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:01.866
Well, that's because
they think you guys hate

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:03.370
each other, so they don't
want to poke the beard.

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:35.170
Hey!

00:18:35.171 --> 00:18:39.990
Hey, come on, let me go.

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:40.850
Come on, let me go.

00:18:40.851 --> 00:18:42.170
Come on, let me go.

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:44.230
Hey, look at all of you.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:45.750
Come on, come on.

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:48.170
Come on, come on.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:03.860
you're right this place is insane all
right let's get some stand under your.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:14.880
feet you guys made up oh god if you
just stay away from me don't need an

00:19:14.881 --> 00:19:18.040
imitation for that I think you do feel
like you can't leave me alone same

00:19:18.041 --> 00:19:22.200
reason I slowed down in a car crash
okay so you guys buried the hatchet water

00:19:22.201 --> 00:19:26.180
under the bridge to adults adult in
my fucking adult oh we did have a little

00:19:26.181 --> 00:19:29.301
bit of a last-minute snack food though
you guys are gonna have to share a room

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:32.441
there's only one bed
but we hung a shower

00:19:32.465 --> 00:19:35.740
curtain in the middle
you're funny I can't wait.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:50.540
how these such a good she's good for
you could use responding hey this weekend

00:19:50.541 --> 00:19:57.140

contingencies and scenarios for everything

00:19:57.365 --> 00:20:01.480
and honestly I just want this wedding
to be beautiful because I love the shit out

00:20:01.481 --> 00:20:04.660
of her and I just want to marry the
bitch you know I'm saying there's such a

00:20:04.661 --> 00:20:09.460
romantic hey don't be mad
at me but Margaret's here.

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:17.820

100% expecting to see her Margaret Margaret

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:27.460
here there she is 100%
go rip off the band-aid.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.800
stranger I was hoping you'd come when
it's message you but I didn't know how

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.340
you feel about hearing from me.

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:55.570
they're good you know mom now thinks
she's Australian and dad's not at all

00:20:55.645 --> 00:20:59.950
pointing out every tiny little detail
that's different they're also a little

00:20:59.951 --> 00:21:04.370
worried how you're gonna react to all
this you know everybody thought that

00:21:04.371 --> 00:21:07.570
you'd be the one getting married first
you always get such stuff about your

00:21:07.571 --> 00:21:10.450
wedding growing up you used to join
the paper as a wedding dress when I

00:21:10.451 --> 00:21:15.630
just used it to dress like a money
stop it's not me anymore I'm free now

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:19.590
I'm deprogrammed that does not mean
I don't support you and your risk any of

00:21:19.591 --> 00:21:28.830
you that's so me that's me you and
Claudia the exception I'm really happy.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:39.710
come on over there that's Claudia's
cousin she visited the states of years

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:44.230
back they dated no biggie
broke up with him precious heart.

00:21:44.955 --> 00:21:51.590
no way that man does not have a heart
feels like forever ago we will make it

00:21:52.190 --> 00:22:00.590
I'm really happy you're here we can reconnect

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:12.190

00:25:20.971 --> 00:25:24.750
long distance and Carol and I are

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:30.170

00:26:40.921 --> 00:26:44.000
the truck yeah I wanted to go with you

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:55.609
Coachella let's just have a moment
to calm ourselves I am NOT looking at

anybody in particular but I am looking
at you be and you've been from chakra.

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:07.520
let's hit that cobra.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:26.780
word first word a liar five words the
Bible a woman who uses her sexuality to

00:27:27.721 --> 00:27:32.480
take advantage of other people mom
right here right here is a white people

00:27:32.481 --> 00:27:35.720
yeah I'll spend so much
time trying to trick each

00:27:35.721 --> 00:27:37.860
other I got so much
time with us say the word.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:54.500
here you go.

00:27:58.815 --> 00:28:02.620
no props don't care no one can see us
cheaters shocking says the woman who

00:28:02.621 --> 00:28:05.960
cheated on our fiance we're on a break
asshole you're either broken up for good

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:23.470
or you're cheating either way someone's
lying to someone hasn't really gotten Oh God.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:28.920
Oh god!

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:31.440
What's going on?

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.120
Get back!

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:36.340
I caught you! I caught this.

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:44.900
Hey, that's some gangster shit right there.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.160
Sorry.

00:28:51.975 --> 00:28:53.440
They're going to ruin our wedding.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.760
All the matters is that we're together.

00:28:55.761 --> 00:28:56.900
It's true.

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:01.120
Look, baby, I love you
to the moon and back,

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.800
but those two fuckwads are
going to destroy our weekend

00:29:03.801 --> 00:29:07.260
and our memories, which
we are going to have for

00:29:07.261 --> 00:29:08.740
a very long time are
headed straight over a cliff.

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:12.280
It's going to be fine, baby. We just
have to stand there and profess our love.

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:17.440
It seems to me they're animists only
surfaced after they spent a night together.

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:18.560
Am I accurate?

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:20.330
Let's use the how it goes, honey.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:24.280
We crumble our feelings into a
ball and shove them deep down

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.720
so we can enjoy a better frisk.

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.300
The solution appears to be simple there.

00:29:28.925 --> 00:29:30.685
We return them to the
night they were spent.

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:33.330
Like we trick them into
falling in love with each other?

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.060
We didn't say anything about love, honey.

00:29:35.315 --> 00:29:37.435
We just need to get them
to jump each other's thumbs.

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.480
She clearly has eyes for Ben.

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:57.820
Who does, Father?

00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.080
Halley Spence, the sister.

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.300
The pump-chested one with the sad eyes.

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:03.460
You can't say that, Halley.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.820
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That was rude.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:10.000
I apologize to anyone that was
listening, which can only be you, Pete,

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.896
because you're the only
person who was listening.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:12.520
I apologize.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.980
I accept your apology and will now move on.

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:18.141
Do you know B's been in love with
Ben since the first night they met?

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:20.020
Well, why didn't she tell him?

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:22.420
You know, when I was a
young bloke and I liked a girl,

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.320
I would sneak up behind
her and I'd cut a lot of her hair

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:26.830
and then I'd smack her on the bum.

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:27.700
What the hell?

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:29.260
I'm not good at this, sorry.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.940
He was just too scared to tell him.

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:33.940
But I talked to her and she said
she regrets walking out that morning.

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:35.120
Tell me more, son.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:35.700
Why me?

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.560
Because you're really good
at it, right? You can do it.

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.256
Why you put this hat on me?

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.280
No one can see me as a
radio player, motherfucker.

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:43.630
He wants us to tell him
how much she likes him.

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:45.470
So he lets his guard down and goes to her.

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:48.020
Some tube is killed with
arrows and some with traps.

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:49.860
That was good. I liked that.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.200
That's good. I just made it up.

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.800
So he needs to go to him, drop his drawers,

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:54.960
and say come to Papa.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.260
What are you doing?

00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:58.030
Right from a different generation.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.520
If your generation sucks, you
fuck at the whole world for us.

00:32:00.521 --> 00:32:01.920
And I'm full of shame.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.420
But the bottom line, he likes Ben.

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:09.140
But Ben feels awful that
he called her a disaster.

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:11.760
I mean, he said it was
his fragile male ego.

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:13.760
Then why is he fighting with her?

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:15.500
Well, because he likes her.

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:17.480
And I know that B likes Ben.

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:19.456
He's just denying herself
because she's got in

00:32:19.468 --> 00:32:21.076
her head somehow that
she'll never love again.

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:23.060
Whoa, I'm not talking about love, baby.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:24.540
I'm talking about dick.

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.080
Oh, it's Ben.

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:40.430
Hey, you.

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.810
Oh, God, they got to you, too.

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:45.950
What?

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:50.410
Did you just overhear Holly and
Claudia say how much I like you?

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:52.030
No.

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:53.290
Really?

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:54.350
It was Pete and Roger.

00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:58.230
Fantastic. It's a team effort.

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:00.770
They're trying to get us together.

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:02.590
No way.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.050
Come here.

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:14.318
Oh, maybe they want us
to stop acting like assholes

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:16.350
so we don't ruin the
biggest event of their lives.

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:16.610
Us?

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.250
There's no us and assholes.

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:21.130
You're the one who
destroyed the living room.

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:22.950
Would you two mind
helping me with something?

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:25.810
I hate to ask, but I really appreciate it.

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:26.650
Sure.

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:28.010
Yeah.

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:39.400
So Roger left his
sunglasses on the sailboat.

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:43.260
I swear, if his head wasn't screwed
on, we'd use it as a bowling ball.

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.000
Do me a favor and smile and get them.

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:47.880
It's the one on the right.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:48.940
Both of us.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.500
Is that really a two-person job?

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:51.820
It doesn't seem like it.

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:53.200
You do say that.

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.280
All right, so everyone's involved in this.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.480
I know.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:07.640
I feel bad.

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:09.000
Me, too.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:11.320
I don't want to blame
Holly and Claudia at all.

00:34:11.321 --> 00:34:14.140
Can you not swim?
Excellent swim.

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:16.960
Why are you so
out of bed? I'm fine.

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:19.876
How much further do you think?

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:20.940
Are your eyes
closed? Please start.

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:23.060
What?

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.060
You're so out of shape.

00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:25.200
You have like a 10 pop.

00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:26.080
I'm not out of shape.

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:28.080
I've been to 295, 300 once.

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:29.340
I just don't do cardio.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.300
Oh, my God.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.500
You're a pop girl fit.

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.800
I'm not pop girl fit.

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:34.620
Okay.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:35.920
My bad.

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:37.240
We'll see you at the boat.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:38.760
Wait.

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:39.520
Wait.

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:41.220
Wait.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.860
I could have done it myself, but whatever.

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:07.740
Thanks.

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:12.910
No fucking way.

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:15.130
Honey, look who's here.

00:35:15.755 --> 00:35:17.130
I cannot believe they did this.

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:17.650
Who is this?

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:19.730
That is my ex, Jonathan.

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:21.930
What is he doing here?

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:24.308
My Black Hawk helicopter
parents have been trying

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.410
to get us back together
for the past four months.

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:29.270
They blew him halfway across
the world to your sister's wedding?

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:30.530
That's a deep up shit.

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:31.670
They came to play.

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:32.970
That's my parents.

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:34.710
They think I'm throwing my life away.

00:35:36.215 --> 00:35:38.546
Honey, we're just gonna take
him back and get him all settled in.

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:39.570
I'll see you later.

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:44.261
You know, maybe we should do it.

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:46.041
Just tell everyone we're together.

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:46.270
What?

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:50.010
It was so that problem for
me and that problem for you.

00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:55.330
I don't have a problem.

00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:57.120
You clearly won't Mark it.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:57.980
No, I don't.

00:35:58.100 --> 00:35:58.660
Yes, you do.

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:01.740
I saw the way you looked at her last
night and I know she broke your heart.

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:03.160
She sees you with me.

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:06.580
She wants what she can't have
and then bye-bye crocodile Jack.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:10.920
He's fast.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.240
Making her jealous is not gonna work.

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:14.280
We're on seventh grade.

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:15.380
Trust me, bro.

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.960
We're all on seventh grade
when it comes to this stuff.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.604
They've already gone
through all of the bullshit

00:36:20.616 --> 00:36:22.380
trying to trick us into
each other's arms.

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.600
Let's just embrace it.

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:26.520
There's no way we can convince
anyone we actually like each other.

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.100
Yeah, you're right.

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.160
I know.

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:37.876
You know, I still think about
that night we spent together.

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:38.900
Shut up.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.440
No, I'm serious.

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:44.971
Yeah, this could be kind of fun.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:50.240
We're at a wedding a
million miles away from home.

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:53.751
Who knows what could happen
under the cover of a masquerade.

00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:58.170
That night at your place.

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:00.391
It's no matter how it ended.

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:02.460
It was still pretty amazing.

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:11.390
Convincing enough? Fuck it.

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:15.570
Let's do it.

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:17.340
Wait.

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:21.090
Wait.

00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:36.760
The hike we need to leave now.

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:38.180
We're running behind schedule.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.260
I'm coming.

00:37:39.705 --> 00:37:42.260
Babe, the mountains have
been there for millions of years.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.040
A few more minutes isn't gonna hurt them.

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:46.981
Baby, I know you are trying to
calm me down and I love you for it.

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:47.500
Thank you.

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:49.720
But I am hurting cats
right now and I need some

00:37:49.732 --> 00:37:51.760
help instead of this easy
breezy month for CZ.

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:53.260
Aww.

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:54.540
Jitters.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.880
Remember our wedding?

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:59.440
Only that you're the most
beautiful bride on God's green earth.

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:01.260
Right there.

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.560
We're coming.

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:03.280
We're coming.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:04.600
We're coming.

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:05.800
Jeez, you owe me a cup.

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:08.116
Oh, we can roll something in here too.

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:08.700
Oh, no, wait, get it.

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:11.020
Get it.

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:12.360
Oh, it's right there.

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:13.140
I gotta get it.

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.340
Get it.

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:18.380
Here he is.

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:20.300
Hey.

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:21.600
Tell me.

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:22.760
So nice to see you.

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:24.100
I have no idea you're coming.

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.120
So your parents didn't tell you.

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:26.680
Okay?

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.600
Yeah, you know, the first task
they invited me was just be known.

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:31.991
Because otherwise, this
would be really fucking awkward.

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:34.280
And now it is fucking awkward.

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.760
No, no, no, no, no.

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:36.180
I have an alarm.

00:38:36.181 --> 00:38:37.181
No, you're like family.

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:38.776
That'd be awkward if you weren't here.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:39.800
I'm so glad you're here.

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:40.100
Hi.

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.300
So happy for you too.

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:41.940
Hey, congratulations.

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:43.300
Yeah, thanks.

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:44.900
Alright.

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:46.310
It's great to see you.

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:47.680
It's great to see you too.

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:51.740
We're all going on a hike, so whoever
wants to come with, we gotta move out.

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:52.860
Let's move out.

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:54.380
Ben? Meet Jonathan.

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:55.580
Oh, hey, man.

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:56.660
I'm Ben.

00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:59.460
Hey, oh, Pete and
Claudia's friend, right? Yeah.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.980
Also friends with B, among other things.

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:11.220
Yeah, it's nice to meet you.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:14.880
Okay, plenty of enough time in the
car to do whatever the fuck this is.

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:15.180
Come on.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:16.520
Let's go.

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:17.980
Okay.

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:18.980
Yeah.

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:20.816
You need to come up with a game plan.

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:22.240
Yeah, you are so careful with this.

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:23.300
What?

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:25.720
We're doing this thing!

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:27.600
Honey, I'm sorry.

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:31.140
I know we should've asked you,
but we had to make fun of him.

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:32.920
Oh, it's totally fine.

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:34.280
I'm glad he's here.

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:35.900
I love him and Holly loves him.

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:36.260
Really? Yeah.

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:37.100
Great.

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:40.179
Okay, so we're spending
a little time together

00:39:40.191 --> 00:39:42.460
away from your world
and see if you're rekindled.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:43.560
You spot a green ball.

00:39:43.561 --> 00:39:44.120
Oh, no.

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:45.500
Mom, guys, no.

00:39:45.745 --> 00:39:48.680
I totally forgot to tell
you, but I'm with Ben.

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:56.280
Do you want to come?

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:59.180
Think I'm going to hang
back and know your parents.

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.300
Have fun.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.638
Alright, so is it like
we just got together

00:40:12.662 --> 00:40:14.300
or we've been sneaking
around? Oh, I got it.

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:18.640
What if we ran into each other at
Chipotle, bleeding the tramp and burrito?

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:19.820
No.

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:21.540
This can't be that hard.

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:22.771
It's harder than you think.

00:40:22.795 --> 00:40:23.976
My parents didn't even believe it yet.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.520
You told them five seconds ago.

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.800
They know I would never
go out with a guy like you.

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:29.880
You've only been with
one guy your entire life.

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.240
Jonathan's a better
man than you'll ever be.

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:33.120
And yet you left him.

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:34.460
Which is why exactly?

00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:36.266
Because he seems like
he checks all your boxes.

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:38.251
Okay, you don't know my
boxes and you never will.

00:40:39.025 --> 00:40:40.186
Just figure this out, please.

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.280
Okay.

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:43.800
We just suck face in front of everybody.

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:45.876
Half of them think they set us up anyway.

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:46.900
No, that's too much.

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:49.298
We need to do something
that's more hidden so it

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:51.600
feels more real, not some
fuckboy wedding I got.

00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:54.820
You keep calling me a fuckboy
like it's an asshole, I own that shit.

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:56.920
Let's just be affectionate.

00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:58.980
I know it's a foreign concept, too.

00:40:58.981 --> 00:41:00.600
Yeah, I can be affectionate.

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:02.570
I'll affectionate the shit out of you.

00:41:03.005 --> 00:41:04.845
I can't believe your
parents invited Jonathan.

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:06.860
Now I have to find a table to sit in her.

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:07.460
What about me?

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.636
No, no, she's fine.
She's sitting with us at our table.

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:11.165
No, I'm talking about
how she's already at a

00:41:11.177 --> 00:41:12.660
low point but she's
going through a breakup

00:41:12.661 --> 00:41:14.236
and I don't even know
what's happening with school.

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:15.920
She never even talks about it anymore.

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.521
I guess I have to put on with her cousins.

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:20.080
Why? Oh, shit.

00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:29.100
Check it out, guys.

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:30.180
Nice.

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:31.100
Yeah.

00:41:31.101 --> 00:41:32.101
It's beautiful.

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:33.876
I'll tell you it's going to be good.

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:34.900
Man, that's nice.

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:36.260
Wow.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.120
It's so beautiful.

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:39.340
Here it is.

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.640
Pretty spectacular,
hey? It's amazing.

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:43.920
Okay.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:45.400
You're done.

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:46.940
Yeah.

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:19.250
Wow.

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:22.450
This is just so romantic.

00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:25.110
Now's with my neck.

00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:25.830
Okay.

00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:27.030
Get in there.

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:30.570
You're short.

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:32.110
You're not tall enough to say that.

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:33.490
Hello.

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:35.030
Oh, are you ticklish?
No, I'm happy.

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:37.150
Like a toddler? No, no, no.

00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:39.410
Okay, I can't stop.

00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:41.190
Why don't we... Stop.

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:42.950
Stop.

00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:44.270
Just let me do it.

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:47.310
Permission to put my left
hand on your right back.

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:49.430
Granted.

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:51.430
Too hard.

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:53.250
Yes, sir.

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:55.270
You're not in circles.

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:56.480
It's not a magic lamp.

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:57.710
What?

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:13.341
All right, now you're
just playing ball pit.

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:14.700
I've never rubbed a bumper show.

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:15.880
Clearly, each one.

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:21.851
Are you not wearing underwear?

00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:22.720
This is one suit.

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:23.900
I'm on holiday.

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.940
Okay, just mind the gap.

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:27.600
How's that? That's good.

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:28.300
Just like.

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:29.140
..

00:43:29.141 --> 00:43:31.121
You know what the harbor just
kind of... You all man wounds.

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:32.440
I'm sorry.

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:33.600
Okay, just take it out.

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:39.080
You try.

00:43:39.505 --> 00:43:40.876
If you want to stick my
finger in my own ass,

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:42.020
how's that going to
come in? Oh, on you.

00:43:45.275 --> 00:43:47.116
Jesus Christ, it's like
back and back down here.

00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:48.260
How'd you get in
this thing? That's tight.

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:51.640
See, it's like holding a baby bird.

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:55.840
God damn it.

00:43:56.910 --> 00:43:58.471
Were they not watching this whole time?

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:01.940
Like a mole or something out of it?

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:02.240
No.

00:44:02.635 --> 00:44:04.020
Really? Because I feel something.

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.120
I'm the mole.

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:13.860
What the fuck?

00:44:13.861 --> 00:44:13.980
What the fuck?

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:15.240
Are there any more?

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:15.600
Are we?

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:16.700
Do we have any more?

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:17.320
No.

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.800
Jack, spiders on Paris.

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.040
They hunt Paris.

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:25.420
No pictures.

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:27.980
The camera's down.

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:29.860
We're not going to take his spirit.

00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:30.800
Are there any more?

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:31.060
No.

00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:31.940
Where are they? I feel it.

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:33.300
I feel it.

00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:35.600
I think I see something.

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:36.240
What do you see?

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:36.960
What do you see? I don't know.

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:39.880
That's just part of you.

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:40.960
You're fine.

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:43.520
Look, if I have one of those little
fuckers in me, they might be in you.

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:47.160
I'm good.

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:50.076
It's probably a better way
to check than what I did.

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:51.100
Yeah.

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:57.070
All right, little.

00:44:57.071 --> 00:44:58.790
We joined your journey.

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:00.830
We do not inherit the earth.

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:03.070
We just borrow it from our creatures.

00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:06.830
Hey, guys.

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:08.170
What did we miss?

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:21.540
Why can't I get this?

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:24.240
Because you're meant to
learn to dive when you're six.

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:27.480
You got this one.

00:45:28.235 --> 00:45:29.635
You ever try focusing on your toes?

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:31.461
My mom taught me this trick.

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:33.836
If you pretend like there's
a strain from your nose

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:36.000
to your toes, you just kind
of maintain that position.

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:37.550
You mind doing it again?

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:39.760
This time I'm going to
shout out a trivia question.

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:41.376
At least this can help clear your mind.

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.240
Just make sure it's a
question about airplanes

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:46.280
or the assassination of
Archduke friend Ferdinand.

00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:49.941
What company created the convoy?

00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:55.320
The collaboration between British
Airways and the French government.

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:58.460
Get in there.

00:45:59.710 --> 00:46:01.920
Maybe your mom can teach him how to dive.

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:04.560
She passed away.

00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:06.900
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:08.380
Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:09.880
All right, I'm going to go again,

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:12.380
but this time give me your
one with a little shorter answer.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.000
I have a better idea.

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.316
Now, you just let me do everything.

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:17.340
I'll guide you in.

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:19.240
Don't think.

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.580
Be careful of his shoulder.

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:23.780
Yeah, I'm going to wreck you
chomping off a moving train in Paris.

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:25.980
Wouldn't let me see the Eiffel Tower alone.

00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:27.790
I had to tell her I love her.

00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:30.500
When you know she's the
one, nothing else matters.

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:41.820
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.180
Here you go.

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:46.700
Do it.

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:47.360
Yeah.

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:47.880
Yeah.

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:49.280
Good job, babe.

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:50.940
Oh, your dad's a natural.

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.540
I'm so glad you guys got to
spend some time with Ben.

00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:55.220
You two, really?

00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:57.316
Getting to know each other
in a very respectful manner.

00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:59.940
One befitting such a kind and
intelligent woman as your daughter.

00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:02.420
Yes, we are in the early stages.

00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:03.060
Not too early.

00:47:03.185 --> 00:47:04.520
But also not so advanced.

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:06.679
Just that magical moment
when two people come

00:47:06.691 --> 00:47:08.540
together in this crazy
journey we call life.

00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:11.240
That's why I was so worried
when Jonathan showed up.

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:12.960
I don't want to hurt his feelings.

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.840
I even suggested we hide
our light in a bushel for his sake.

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:18.340
But our love is just so strong.

00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:20.391
And I know what you guys are thinking.

00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:22.610
He's much older.

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:24.180
They were, right?

00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:28.400
Probably thinking I'm 27, early 28s.

00:47:30.110 --> 00:47:31.760
Yes, we are very happy.

00:47:31.761 --> 00:47:32.761
Happiest.

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:33.980
Yep.

00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:40.311
You know, you looked
like that back in the day.

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:41.500
No, I didn't.

00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:43.331
That guy's made out of cobblestone.

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:46.200
They're holding hands.

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:47.340
I think it's working.

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:49.460
I can't believe the lessons
were so easily fooled.

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:55.111
Was that bullshit about your mother?

00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:56.580
What?

00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:57.981
The story about the giant wrench.

00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:01.311
I thought it might have been a
lining to all your one-night-nothings.

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:04.600
You overheard that too.

00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:08.600
I didn't mean...

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:13.790
I'm sorry.

00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:16.650
It wasn't a line.

00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:20.590
Seems to be nice to my dad.

00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:27.290
You should probably rinse off.

00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:30.450
You have his SPF a billion on you now.

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:38.800
Geez, man, I'll just grab a cookie.

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:40.900
Okay.

00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:47.020
So, Australia, what do you reckon, eh?

00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:48.580
How are you binding it?

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:49.680
I know, it's great.

00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:52.040
Matt's goes on about you all the time.

00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:53.500
A ripper cunt, she calls you.

00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:55.180
Matt's is more of it.

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:57.721
A ripper cunt is... Good friend.

00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:03.680
You know, you had a proper surf
when the sand gets all up your clacker.

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:05.920
And you gobble it too.

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:09.081
Gobbler is... You
know, you hog bon it.

00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:11.540
You know, your bean
cap? Come on, mate.

00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:14.820
You know, the ante's up.

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:19.300
Anyway, good to have you.

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:21.440
Gotcha.

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.240
You got any left? Hey, mate.

00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:29.980
Into your game.

00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:33.260
You're going down.

00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:38.110
How have you been
doing? Pretty good.

00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:40.810
You?

00:49:41.110 --> 00:49:42.110
Okay, I got you.

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:43.690
How's school going?

00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:46.306
What kind of law do you want
to practice yet? You know me.

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:48.710
I've never been one for practicing.

00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:51.051
Still having second thoughts?

00:49:51.210 --> 00:49:52.210
Straight to therapy.

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:57.930
I know it's weird, me being here, but
believe me, I had nothing to do with it.

00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:00.590
Your parents do me,
give it a freak of fire, Miles.

00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:02.110
That's weird.

00:50:02.410 --> 00:50:03.450
You're part of the family.

00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:07.430
I'd be lying if I said I hadn't
been thinking about you.

00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:12.420
And me too.

00:50:12.421 --> 00:50:13.421
Okay.

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:17.460
How long have you and that dad been?

00:50:18.675 --> 00:50:19.680
It's kind of new.

00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:22.860
Not like new-new, but new-ish.

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:24.820
Well, I think he seems great.

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:26.760
No, you don't.

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:27.960
I really don't.

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:32.201
Thanks for being so cool about all of this.

00:50:34.570 --> 00:50:38.420
Not just this, but this too.

00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:42.151
It's really good to see you, V.

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:43.440
I'm glad you're here.

00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:46.180
Now let's have a party.

00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:48.220
Let's do it.

00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:01.780
Me? That's me.

00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:07.420
You want coffee?

00:51:08.070 --> 00:51:09.151
It's the best in the world.

00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:11.510
You guys are really
proud of your coffee here.

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:13.541
It's the best in the fucking world.

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:14.840
Okay.

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:16.280
Enjoy.

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:21.840
Fuck, that is good.

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:24.940
I was thinking of going
for a bit of a run later.

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:27.220
Do you want to join?

00:51:29.250 --> 00:51:32.100
I'm actually going on a bike
ride with B, so I don't think I can.

00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:34.261
She's a little sweet on you, hey?

00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:35.780
Oh, you caught that.

00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:39.020
How long have you and Bo been together?

00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:40.660
Nah, we're just banging about.

00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:43.940
He's nice, but I think I'm
looking for someone less casual.

00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:45.690
More romantic.

00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:50.831
Why didn't you have a break up anyway?

00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:55.471
I don't really remember,
but I think you said something

00:51:55.483 --> 00:51:58.460
like I was an immature drongo
smothered in X body spray.

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:05.391
Smells like you're not that guy anymore.

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:07.540
Be the lucky girl.

00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:28.290
What's wrong?

00:52:28.770 --> 00:52:30.010
Margaret thinks we're together.

00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:30.790
That's great.

00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:31.470
No.

00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:34.126
Margaret needs to think
we're the right type of together.

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:36.351
Not together together, but
like situationally together.

00:52:36.475 --> 00:52:38.906
Because if she thinks we're together
together, she's not going to break girl code.

00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:41.870
So we need to finesse our
togetherness so that we're together.

00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:44.304
But there's an opening
for our togetherness so that

00:52:44.316 --> 00:52:46.306
you can just slide right in
so that we can be together.

00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:47.030
Are you on coke?

00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:48.010
There's lots of coffee here.

00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:48.550
It's like meth.

00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:50.130
I'm guessing.

00:52:50.310 --> 00:52:51.310
No, I'm not.

00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:52.370
I worked at Goldman.

00:52:52.450 --> 00:52:52.810
Partner's wedding.

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:53.770
Do what you do.

00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:55.850
Jesus, dude, who are you?

00:52:55.930 --> 00:52:57.370
I'm a man trying to figure this out.

00:52:58.590 --> 00:52:59.290
Look at your room.

00:52:59.410 --> 00:53:00.010
It's so much bigger.

00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:01.230
You got a painting?

00:53:01.530 --> 00:53:02.570
Wow, that's so red.

00:53:03.310 --> 00:53:04.511
We have to kick it up a notch.

00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:06.206
Make it feel like we're on the Gaga stage.

00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.810
What do you want to do?

00:53:06.910 --> 00:53:07.670
Take me in the hallway?

00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:08.930
That is not Gaga.

00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:11.700
Actually, that could be considered as Gaga.

00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:13.187
Tonight's the rehearsal
dinner, so we have to do

00:53:13.199 --> 00:53:15.630
something that makes it look like
you're into me, but you're not into me.

00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:18.940
And I'm into you, but you can tell by
my face that it's never going to mount.

00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:20.860
Get it together, man.

00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:23.210
You hit me so much.

00:53:26.410 --> 00:53:27.050
Okay, come on.

00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:30.050
Let me now pretend this is a
real box that messed up our car.

00:53:36.211 --> 00:53:37.211
Fuck it up.

00:53:38.110 --> 00:53:39.110
You see that? He did it.

00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:42.390
Oh, hey, they're here.

00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:43.270
All right, everybody.

00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:43.770
We'll go.

00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:45.350
Up below.

00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:31.600
Thank you.

00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:35.460
Oh.

00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:37.460
Nice touch.

00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:39.140
Nice dress.

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:14.260
What would you like to drink?

00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:16.740
What's a traditional
drink for a hustle dinner?

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:19.320
Reese got just neat and
a champagne for ladies.

00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:21.020
Thank you.

00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:22.600
You remembered.

00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:24.440
That you can't handle
hard liquor? Yeah.

00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:26.540
It smells still not on my car.

00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:28.660
No, I feel really bad about that.

00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:31.920
That was a fun night.

00:55:32.650 --> 00:55:33.650
That was a fun summer.

00:55:37.830 --> 00:55:40.240
Marks, captain says
that we can steer the ship.

00:55:45.155 --> 00:55:46.240
Look how lucky we are.

00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:49.480
On a boat, sailing back and forth
with no real transportation or anything.

00:55:50.970 --> 00:55:51.700
Spoiler alert.

00:55:51.701 --> 00:55:52.901
But look at you, body bargain.

00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:54.420
We're the belt of all.

00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:01.300
He's remembering.

00:56:03.395 --> 00:56:04.940
Oh, hey, look, is that
Tasmania? No, honey.

00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:09.020
That's, uh, yes, I think it might be.

00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:10.620
Holly, Tasmania.

00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:11.660
Oh, yep.

00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:13.180
At least that was so.

00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:14.720
Was it?

00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:17.620
This oddly reminds me of Prague.

00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:19.740
The first or second time.

00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:22.580
Jonathan is just the most perfect guy.

00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:24.420
He's like a Saint to us.

00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:26.460
Well, that might be a problem, mate.

00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:29.200
We might not want to shag a brother.

00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:32.961
He's going to look his favorite song.

00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:52.030
So how's it going?

00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:53.430
Turns back off a little.

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:05.280
Game on.

00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:06.460
Can you even dance?

00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:07.780
You just love me, please.

00:57:20.310 --> 00:57:21.310
Let's go.

00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:02.980
It's a little hard to tell if
Bitch Hemsworth in my way.

00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:05.220
Everybody's in the top deck.

00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:07.000
We're about to do a champagne toast.

00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:08.800
Come on, mate.

00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:15.560
What's in the deal? Titanic me.

00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:26.040
What?

00:58:26.041 --> 00:58:28.060
Oh, y'all hear something so trippy.

00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:29.500
Oh, cute.

00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:33.200
Titanic me.

00:58:34.610 --> 00:58:35.900
No, but it's so lame.

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:37.400
Exactly.

00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:41.880
The only people who would do something this
lame are the ones who know how lame it is,

00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:44.652
but are in the first stages
of liking each other, so

00:58:44.664 --> 00:58:47.460
they're totally comfortable
in their mutual lameness.

00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:49.240
Toss my hands.

00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:50.460
Oh my god.

00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:50.980
Come on.

00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:52.140
This is so cringe.

00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:54.200
So it's saying cringe, old man.

00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:57.040
Oh my god.

00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:03.940
Look at my arms.

00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:06.100
I've seen a movie.

00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:07.200
Have you?

00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:09.440
Hello?

00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:11.800
OK.

00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:13.060
OK.

00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:14.460
This is never gonna work.

00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:19.620
Oh, this is the cutest
thing I've ever seen.

00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:21.160
Are they doing Titanic?

00:59:28.161 --> 00:59:32.220
are they watching yep are they buying it.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:50.840
it's real we did it we're good we're
really bloody good Jonathan if you see.

00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:57.680
I'm gonna do the line.

01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:08.060
it's key the world you're gonna stop there.

01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:20.920
they're gone shows over.

01:00:54.250 --> 01:01:00.010
save you we are terrible swimmer I'm
a great swimmer just short distances.

01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:17.040
we're gonna die we're not gonna die the
water's 90 degrees we're gonna be fine.

01:01:18.375 --> 01:01:21.376
I would spend 10 hours shredding
water off the coast of the Cayman Islands.

01:01:31.305 --> 01:01:35.190
it looks like they're going full-time
today I love the commitment.

01:01:52.830 --> 01:01:53.830
yeah.

01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:05.450
well we should in the bubble around we
are in to show the water will run aground.

01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:59.420
I'll jump in and do it that's for sure
your parents out the clock that's sure.

01:03:02.170 --> 01:03:06.380
why do you keep defending this guy why
do you break up with him in the first place

01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:12.220
it's complicated it's never complicated
what he cheated on you drug problem you

01:03:12.221 --> 01:03:19.580
catch him measuring a stick with the
ruler out we never fought is that a good

01:03:19.581 --> 01:03:24.100
thing he's just comfortable and he's a
great guy which means there's no one

01:03:24.101 --> 01:03:28.260
out there for me because I have
the best one I couldn't even tell my

01:03:28.261 --> 01:03:34.280
possible and I have no idea what I'm
gonna do with my life we're gonna get

01:03:34.281 --> 01:03:39.960
eaten by sharks I had it on somebody
no one else knows I don't think this is the

01:03:39.961 --> 01:03:47.660
weekend to drop that bomb you finally
did what you know one night you said you

01:03:47.661 --> 01:03:53.020
didn't want to be a lawyer anyways
remember that I was memorable night.

01:03:53.670 --> 01:04:00.840
so you snuck out of course why did you.

01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:05.100
have you scared the shit out of me.

01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:14.580
it was the first time in my life that I
felt fire and I had a blowout I know a

01:04:14.581 --> 01:04:22.100
little bit about that I was really
hurt when you left so I said all that

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:27.020
terrible stuff about you
to pee it's not how it felt.

01:04:32.205 --> 01:04:33.850
look at us.

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:41.370
a couple of fucked up people in the
middle of the harbor promise me if we

01:04:41.371 --> 01:04:46.110
make it out alive go see that from dry
land it's a pretty killer day from here.

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:50.870
it's dumb but I want to see the
people landmarks like those are full of

01:04:50.871 --> 01:04:55.750
people in love marriage proposals
when a new nurse romantics jumping off of

01:04:55.751 --> 01:04:59.590
moving trains just to
see the building with the

01:04:59.591 --> 01:05:00.591
person they love I like
your dad in the Eiffel Tower.

01:05:02.550 --> 01:05:07.350
they told you not nothing else
matters when it comes to love.

01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:11.310
it could be as if I love right now.

01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:13.570
it's not dumb.

01:05:15.010 --> 01:05:18.190
you me in the Opera House it's a date.

01:05:19.070 --> 01:05:21.030
I promise.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.160
a little afraid of flying
I have a very specific

01:06:28.811 --> 01:06:29.870
routine I'm as headphones
build my bubble.

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:45.560

do you know my Serenity song.

01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:52.800

01:06:52.801 --> 01:06:58.580

reaching for something in the distance

01:06:58.581 --> 01:07:05.360
so close you can almost taste it release
your innovation feel the rain on your skin

me though it was fun.

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:26.620
stupid but fun

01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:28.180
oh that's the best guy.

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:40.200
no no no it's hot.

01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:45.260
when are you ever gonna learn.

01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:47.911
like what are you blowing?

01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:57.660
is it still hot?

01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:32.980
I'm cold anyone
but you could get it

01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:58.190
You're gonna back up all fit bold.

01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:02.730
you'll only piece my mind

01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:07.990
just take your time
just take your time.

01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:11.310
you got me so proud.

01:10:13.970 --> 01:10:17.090
I've got nothing left.

01:10:18.970 --> 01:10:22.970
And I can't go back.

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:27.290
And you feel so right.

01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:39.290
This could be every night
When I'm holding you so tight.

01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:45.240
We're getting pretty good at faking it

01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:47.440
I don't even know what's real anymore.

01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:51.340
Everything I do just feels like a mistake.

01:11:42.330 --> 01:11:44.440
Kelly, what are they?
Is that the handprint?

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:48.280
No.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.170
Everything I do just feels like
a mistake Everything I do just

01:12:37.491 --> 01:12:39.850
feels like a mistake Everything
I do just feels like a mistake.

01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:50.610
Ben, are you ready? We've got
one step to go I'm coming, I'm coming

01:12:50.611 --> 01:12:53.466
Man, I hope you're scrubbing
top to bottom Because who

01:12:53.490 --> 01:12:54.730
knows what was in that
harbor I also show our last name

01:12:54.905 --> 01:12:56.250
Two showers at eight dollars

01:12:56.575 --> 01:12:58.370
Go off, can't get clean.

01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:11.460
It's Mary!

01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:13.000
Are you excited?

01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:17.900
Yes, I'm so excited to marry Claudia
But, you know, I'm also hosting a party

01:13:17.901 --> 01:13:19.880
Where it feels like we're
all playing parts in a play

01:13:19.881 --> 01:13:23.880
And I'm not really into the pageantry
And I kind of just want to do a weirdo

01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:27.440
All that matters is that you and Claudia
Are the rest of your lives together.

01:13:28.610 --> 01:13:29.610
I love you.

01:13:30.210 --> 01:13:31.210
I love you too.

01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:35.501
Hey, you're still good
too Get the cake, right?

01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:39.620
Yes, ma'am Awesome I put Margaret
on it with you just to be safe Margaret.

01:13:49.730 --> 01:13:51.911
All right, talk to me,
baby Who's it gonna be?

01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:53.010
Margaret Orby

01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:55.990
Come on, man, don't get me
there There's two girls talking

01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:58.311
I'll get it though It's tough

01:13:58.625 --> 01:13:59.850
Mary Pie's your dream girl

01:14:00.425 --> 01:14:01.570
She's confident, beautiful

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:04.051
And she knows how to put
out a fire when they retire

01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:05.670
Now, B's waxing out the head.

01:14:06.410 --> 01:14:08.510
She's smart, funny, quick

01:14:09.010 --> 01:14:12.210
And she's got an ass you're
about to put her off of What?

01:14:12.730 --> 01:14:15.330
I'm not objectifying Margaret, man I'm
gonna be inappropriate That's because

01:14:15.730 --> 01:14:18.450
It's inappropriate with B, too
This is deeper than I thought

01:14:18.750 --> 01:14:23.410
Hey, Sydney, my boy is in
love Stop, dude, stop What?

01:14:23.730 --> 01:14:25.891
I know what you're doing I
know what you've all been doing.

01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:28.190
You set us up and we went
along with it But it's fake.

01:14:29.610 --> 01:14:30.626
That was my stepdad, right?

01:14:30.650 --> 01:14:31.650
You can't act for shit.

01:14:32.050 --> 01:14:33.970
You suck too, bro
That's foul, dog

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:37.410
It's definitely gotta be B, man I
don't know, man I don't fucking know

01:14:37.411 --> 01:14:41.430
She doesn't know what she wants She's single
For basically the first time in her life

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:44.790
She just quit law school
Or fucking fiancé's here.

01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:47.170
Stop with all those white boys

01:14:47.470 --> 01:14:49.490
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa Cheers

01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:51.090
Anytime something gets real

01:14:51.190 --> 01:14:51.830
You run away

01:14:51.930 --> 01:14:53.030
Call yourself a fuckboy

01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:55.490
Make an excuse And you
just move on to the next.

01:14:56.190 --> 01:14:57.190
It's B.

01:14:57.570 --> 01:15:00.650
You jumped off a boat for her.

01:15:02.850 --> 01:15:05.701
Oh, that's perfect They're
gonna love it Thank you so much

01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:07.260
Let me get these boxes
up for you Thank you.

01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:11.671
Can I get all the pageantry of weddings?

01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:14.261
If you like someone, give
them a snog Give it to yourself

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:17.110
And we're a wedding dress for
Halloween Five years in a row

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:19.940
Stop it No, I know,
it's so pathetic.

01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:22.220
But I am with you now

01:15:22.570 --> 01:15:24.100
This is not for me

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:25.701
So you haven't been on series?

01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:27.380
What? No, no, I just.

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.860
We're just situationally together.

01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:36.376
When I saw you last night
in the harbor, I thought

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:39.000
I might be more with
you two Just situationally

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:40.100
Is an American bear?

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:41.320
I don't even know.

01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:44.340
So you're right, if I have a goat in me.

01:15:45.730 --> 01:15:48.051
I feel like I might have made
a mistake letting him loose.

01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:51.800
If that's not okay,
just tell me For real.

01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:56.960
I know he really makes you.

01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:03.681
How do you think I
should play this with Ben?

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.481
Should I wait until after the wedding?

01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:07.550
Um, I don't know.

01:16:08.490 --> 01:16:09.490
Have you guys looked up?

01:16:09.610 --> 01:16:10.950
Beatrice You quit school

01:16:10.951 --> 01:16:13.450
You're just gonna work assily
on everything you've worked for?

01:16:13.570 --> 01:16:14.890
Is there still time to re-enroll?

01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:17.210
As soon as you broke up with
Jonas, then everything turned to potty

01:16:17.211 --> 01:16:19.430
You want drugs because at
least then I don't understand

01:16:19.655 --> 01:16:21.310
Who told you I quit law school?

01:16:21.450 --> 01:16:22.050
Was it Ben?

01:16:22.150 --> 01:16:22.810
You quit school?

01:16:23.070 --> 01:16:23.230
What?

01:16:23.650 --> 01:16:24.771
When were you gonna tell us?

01:16:24.910 --> 01:16:25.950
Is this to get back at us?

01:16:26.010 --> 01:16:29.790
I'm sorry if we pushed you to succeed your
whole life We're such awful parents Yeah

01:16:29.890 --> 01:16:33.030
Mom, this isn't about you Yes
it is It is about us Yes and no

01:16:33.031 --> 01:16:36.110
We're not gonna let you throw away your
life Because you're going through something

01:16:36.111 --> 01:16:39.290
Everyone is always going
through something It's called life

01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:44.190
I can't believe you

01:16:44.710 --> 01:16:45.791
You told him I quit school?

01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:46.650
No, I didn't

01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:48.130
You told Pete, Pete told us

01:16:48.630 --> 01:16:49.270
I told you what?

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:52.590
Yeah, no, I told Pete, but I didn't
mean it like that Told you what?

01:16:53.010 --> 01:16:55.750
That we're gonna find out at some
point That's not for you to decide

01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:59.611
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to It doesn't
matter how we found out Found out what?

01:16:59.650 --> 01:17:00.910
She quit law school

01:17:01.210 --> 01:17:03.071
Oh yeah, I knew
that You're a real shit

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:04.710
I made a mistake, I'm sorry

01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:07.151
There's a reason why you're
alone No one can trust you.

01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:08.910
Yeah, what's your
reason? Guys like you.

01:17:10.990 --> 01:17:12.390
Keep telling yourself that

01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:13.830
Fuck off

01:17:13.930 --> 01:17:17.970
Oh, I'm gonna do this right here right
now I messed this song up It's all on me

01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:20.010
Why not not wheel guy for a swim, right?

01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:22.951
Cool off before the wedding That's
a great idea Maybe early drinks

01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:24.390
Guys, I am so sorry

01:17:24.690 --> 01:17:29.270
But your plan is all ruined We are not
together We are faking it the whole time

01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:30.470
You knew?

01:17:30.510 --> 01:17:32.050
What are they even talking about?

01:17:32.190 --> 01:17:35.070
Well, we may have orchestrated
a union between the pair of them

01:17:35.370 --> 01:17:37.430
In order for peace to
prevail across the land

01:17:37.730 --> 01:17:38.730
You lied to us?

01:17:38.975 --> 01:17:40.890
What have you been honest about lately?

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:42.480
You lied to me too.

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:44.040
You're not together?

01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:45.870
I could never be with someone like him.

01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:47.951
Yeah, cause I'm the one who fucked it up.

01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:49.750
You did fuck it
up I fucked it up?

01:17:49.850 --> 01:17:52.171
Yeah, you fucked it up I
fucked it up You fucked it up.

01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:55.610
Oh, bad dog, a lot of you

01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:57.610
I mean, good dog, you killed that shit

01:17:57.611 --> 01:17:59.350
But let's not leave the room,
okay, buddy? I am so sorry.

01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:21.100
Me?

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:43.180
You're perfect And you've
been more worried about going.

01:19:50.730 --> 01:19:53.790
Well, if that's how you feel, then why
are we even doing this? I don't know.

01:20:07.065 --> 01:20:09.910
There's one last thing we need to fake.

01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:38.470
Claudia, Ally.

01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:44.850
We're assholes We're really sorry I'm a
terrible sister and he's a terrible friend

01:20:45.275 --> 01:20:46.275
It's your guys' big day.

01:20:46.890 --> 01:20:49.231
We're not gonna mess
it up, we promise Uh-huh

01:20:49.450 --> 01:20:50.530
But just so you both know

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:53.270
If you fuck up today,
that's something I borrowed

01:20:53.670 --> 01:20:55.510
It's a knife and a shiny onion.

01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:31.430
It's not here, it's mine
It's not your option.

01:21:32.830 --> 01:21:34.710
It's not your option

01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:42.730
It's not your option
Love is intoxicating

01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:48.670
It envelops you, it tickles you It
makes you feel like you can walk on air.

01:21:49.410 --> 01:21:52.730
It's like this wind It's in
your bones, it's in your breath

01:21:53.210 --> 01:21:54.850
It's in every beat of your heart

01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:58.950
You can't look for it, you can't
describe it And you gotta Skype.

01:22:01.170 --> 01:22:03.010
Hallie, I love you so much.

01:22:03.930 --> 01:22:05.330
And I don't think I say it enough.

01:22:06.230 --> 01:22:07.930
You are a yin to my Yang.

01:22:08.610 --> 01:22:09.770
Peanut butter to my chili

01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:11.790
And I will love you forever and always.

01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:16.310
Claudia, I love you with
so much of my heart.

01:22:16.990 --> 01:22:18.850
But none is left to protest

01:22:19.150 --> 01:22:20.150
That's very good.

01:22:20.730 --> 01:22:22.050
Just made it up.

01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:24.950
A lot of it.

01:22:25.890 --> 01:22:34.310
I now pronounce you

01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:35.870
Married!

01:23:15.190 --> 01:23:18.210
Oh hey parents
Is that Taz mania?

01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:21.830
How are you doing honey?

01:23:22.570 --> 01:23:25.070
I am so sorry I lied to
you guys about school

01:23:25.071 --> 01:23:27.410
I didn't want to
disappoint you guys again

01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:30.730
You just told us maybe we could
have Should I talk me out of it?

01:23:30.930 --> 01:23:35.630
No, maybe we could have supported
you I know this is scary for you guys

01:23:35.631 --> 01:23:39.870
This is scary for me too And I
have to figure it out on my own.

01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:45.170
I know that every now and then We
might come off as a little Controlling?

01:23:45.370 --> 01:23:45.610
No

01:23:46.190 --> 01:23:46.710
Overbearing?

01:23:46.970 --> 01:23:48.550
No Fresh and crazy?

01:23:48.930 --> 01:23:49.090
Yes

01:23:49.630 --> 01:23:53.630
That's it And only because
we love you so much.

01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:01.140
Yay! I love you.

01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:02.460
So nice.

01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:34.720
I think we have to
keep it on somewhere in

01:24:34.721 --> 01:24:35.761
here Hang on Yes
Do you mind if I still in?

01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:37.320
Uh, cut it off Go ahead.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Hi.

01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:48.060
Where's Beau?

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:49.500
We bugged it off.

01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:52.760
We said he saw her wave
He could morally not serve.

01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:54.740
I'm sorry.

01:24:55.510 --> 01:24:56.671
It was never really anything.

01:24:58.240 --> 01:24:59.240
And you and Bee.

01:25:00.270 --> 01:25:02.020
She said you were just situational.

01:25:04.130 --> 01:25:05.460
She said that?

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:18.580
Are you good?

01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:22.300
Yeah, we know it's been
a tough weekend for you.

01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:23.940
I don't know.

01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:25.920
And these last few days.

01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:29.560
Really made me realize how much I miss you.

01:25:32.245 --> 01:25:36.680
Why don't you just go for a walk Feel your
head Yeah, we'll go with you No we won't No

01:25:37.105 --> 01:25:39.020
I love you, but
It's our wedding.

01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:41.160
Are you sure?

01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:42.480
No.

01:25:42.705 --> 01:25:44.960
I might go and do some
people watching Just not.

01:25:44.961 --> 01:25:46.260
These people.

01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:48.680
Thank you.

01:25:58.830 --> 01:25:59.830
Ben.

01:26:12.415 --> 01:26:14.000
I wanted this for so long.

01:26:16.580 --> 01:26:18.301
But I think I'm just holding onto a memory.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.200
And also I.

01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:26.120
I'm sorry.

01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:28.280
I'm so sorry.

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:18.900
Who was the first person to say that, Ben?

01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:22.740
I know it sounds crazy,
but even when they were

01:27:22.741 --> 01:27:24.100
yapping at each other It
never seemed to be happy.

01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:25.900
Same thing.

01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:29.400
Hey Stepfather, may I have a word?

01:27:29.925 --> 01:27:32.700
Yes, but make it quick, son
I promised my lady a dance

01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:34.181
But don't tell your mother.

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:38.720
You're so clever You know
who's also clever? Ben.

01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:41.320
You know who else would be perfect for Ben?

01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:44.760
That mumbly girl who always
looks like she's got a secret

01:27:44.910 --> 01:27:45.940
You know her name is Bee

01:27:46.090 --> 01:27:47.090
That's a callback

01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:48.360
Will you stop? Stop.

01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:51.600
Oh.

01:27:51.630 --> 01:27:52.991
How you doing? How you doing, Ben?

01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:54.260
What are you doing?

01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:55.100
What? Just enough.

01:27:57.130 --> 01:27:59.840
With the loud talking and
people over here Just stop

01:27:59.890 --> 01:28:01.780
Bro, we literally didn't know you
were something, man Yeah, it's true

01:28:01.781 --> 01:28:03.740
We didn't know you
were listening We didn't

01:28:03.865 --> 01:28:07.270
It's greatly a performance for one And
we nailed it, too What is with you people?

01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:11.940
This is an entire weekend I've been
lied to and manipulated and puppeteered.

01:28:12.710 --> 01:28:16.041
I don't know what is real and what is
not Might I know you're a little blurry?

01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:18.621
Well, I meant what I
said up there about loud.

01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:20.791
It's too precious a resource to be wasted.

01:28:23.235 --> 01:28:23.840
I haven't seen her

01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:26.280
She went on a walk a while ago.

01:28:26.975 --> 01:28:28.540
After she saw you kissing Margaret.

01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:30.420
What?

01:28:31.410 --> 01:28:34.221
No, I didn't kiss Margaret
Margaret kissed me I backed up

01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:36.421
I don't want to be
with Margaret Stop it

01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:41.260
You gorgeous idiot Run Don't
wait on the box What are you doing?

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:43.280
Did I worry about the
eye difference? I'm 29.

01:28:45.445 --> 01:28:47.340
Honey, no one's 29.

01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:49.120
Do you know where she went?

01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:51.601
She said she wanted to walk
around And do some people watching

01:28:51.930 --> 01:28:52.930
That's what she said.

01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:54.260
People watching

01:28:54.465 --> 01:28:57.140
I think it was more of a
euphemism for crying alone.

01:28:58.370 --> 01:28:59.370
No, it's not.

01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:02.440
I think I know where she might be

01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:06.620
Thank God, man, go get her Scour
the city Block by block Scan the grid

01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:09.900
First north, south, then east,
west Liam, I know exactly

01:29:09.950 --> 01:29:11.431
where she is No, well,
that makes it a lot easier.

01:29:22.410 --> 01:29:23.410
What's going on here?

01:29:24.230 --> 01:29:24.610
Is that coffee? Uh, yeah.

01:29:25.170 --> 01:29:26.170
Okay.

01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:50.481
No, it's a joke
No, it's a joke No.

01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:01.760
That's crazy.

01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:06.020
Why do you just treat people on my boat?

01:31:06.860 --> 01:31:07.860
You said get the girl.

01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:10.320
Thank you.

01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:39.660
Kiss Margaret, she kissed me I know
that's a bullshit excuse, but it's true.

01:31:41.870 --> 01:31:43.271
I couldn't find a move in training.

01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:45.400
Sorry, it's the best I could do.

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:47.740
Are you out of your mind? Yeah.

01:31:48.990 --> 01:31:51.060
Because it's been two years since we met

01:31:51.110 --> 01:31:54.680
And I haven't spent every single day
with you That's the side of a crazy person.

01:31:55.460 --> 01:31:56.460
I hated you

01:31:56.820 --> 01:31:58.141
I didn't really give you a choice

01:31:58.415 --> 01:31:59.820
And I definitely didn't hate you

01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:01.541
Even though you called me a bitch

01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:04.501
I said you were acting like
a bitch No, I was a bitch.

01:32:06.130 --> 01:32:08.340
The way I handled
everything The way I handled

01:32:08.341 --> 01:32:09.501
the first night The way
I handled last night.

01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:12.120
Yeah, that was really awesome.

01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:14.360
Why did you leave?

01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:17.820
I thought you were gonna regret it

01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:20.880
And I couldn't fix the idea of
losing someone else that I...

01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:23.260
I really loved.

01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:29.120
Last night was the first thing I
haven't regretted in a long time.

01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:34.160
I love the way we fight

01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:39.840
I love how smart you are I love the weird
way you stick your hands down my pants

01:32:40.065 --> 01:32:42.620
And I love how you
know what you don't want.

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:44.720
But if it's not me.

01:32:46.090 --> 01:32:48.981
If I don't check all your
boxes If I'm not the one I get it.

01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:55.440
That would really, really fucking suck.

01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:03.440
So you got a kiss for
me now? Yeah, I am.

01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:23.120
I'm running for Mr.

01:33:23.121 --> 01:33:25.620
Lucario Yeah, I'm dying
It's a mirror I love you.

01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:11.290
I love you too I love you too I'm
just beginning Hands in my hand.

01:34:13.130 --> 01:34:16.130
And bring some friends.

01:34:17.005 --> 01:34:22.470
Staring at the place where you've
been for you Open up the dirty window

01:34:22.471 --> 01:34:26.390
Where's the sun and the wind
Ain't the world that you can't find

01:34:26.391 --> 01:34:29.070
I didn't know my Swellity song
How did I know my Swellity song?

01:34:29.071 --> 01:34:34.470
It's been so close You almost faced
it With each other In the vision of steel

01:34:34.471 --> 01:34:40.470
And a rain on God's skin No one else
can be before you Only you can imagine

01:34:40.471 --> 01:34:45.790
No one else, no one else Can
speak no words Only one lives

01:34:45.791 --> 01:34:50.630
Let yourself count words as home
Leave your life with us wide open

01:34:50.631 --> 01:34:55.450
Today is where you'll both
begin The rest is still on record.

01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:06.970
We've been conditioned Sometimes
my tries Are outside the line Of my yes

01:35:06.971 --> 01:35:11.450
We've been conditioned
To not make mistakes

01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:19.510
That I can live that way Staring at
the place where you've been for you

01:35:19.511 --> 01:35:23.270
Open up the dirty window
Where's the sun and the wind

01:35:23.271 --> 01:35:29.010
Ain't the world that you
can't find I didn't know

01:35:29.011 --> 01:35:31.250
my Swellity song So
close, you almost faced it.

01:35:31.950 --> 01:35:35.990
With each other In the vision
of steel And a rain on God's skin

01:35:35.991 --> 01:35:42.790
No one else can be before you Only
you can imagine No one else, no one else

01:35:42.791 --> 01:35:50.070
Can speak no words Only one
lives Leave your life with us wide open

01:35:50.071 --> 01:35:54.870
Today is where you'll both
begin The rest is still on record

01:35:54.871 --> 01:35:58.550
I'm sorry you almost called
off your wedding We can

01:35:58.551 --> 01:36:01.570
call over bullshit What? I
saw you arguing on the porch

01:36:01.670 --> 01:36:04.851
Oh no no no, we staged a fake fight
So you guys would feel bad and make up

01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:07.210
Are you marrying your
precious itinerary or me?

01:36:07.630 --> 01:36:10.470
Well if that's how you feel, I don't
know why we're doing this anymore.

01:36:12.490 --> 01:36:13.370
Thank you very much Puppets.

01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:16.310
Or just puppets.

01:36:17.230 --> 01:36:18.230
Yep.

01:36:18.530 --> 01:36:23.610
Staring at the blank page before
you Open up the dirty window

01:36:23.611 --> 01:36:27.710
Where's the sun and the wind
Name the words that you cannot find

01:36:27.711 --> 01:36:33.270
Reaching for something
in the distance Of course

01:36:33.271 --> 01:36:35.050
you can almost face it
Release your inhibition.

01:36:39.010 --> 01:36:45.850
Fill the rain on God's skin No one else
can be before you Only you can let it in

01:36:45.851 --> 01:36:50.510
No one else, no one else Can
speak no words Only one lives

01:36:50.730 --> 01:36:58.250
Leave your life with
us wide open Today is

01:36:58.251 --> 01:37:00.370
where we'll begin The
rest is still our intent.

01:37:02.890 --> 01:37:05.050
The rest is still our intent.
